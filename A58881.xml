            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>, and that I ſhould have taken it rather for a Satyre, than an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium. The operations of the ſpirit are too important to be left to the conduct of chance, and I had rather bee accuſed for fayling out of knowledge, than for doing well without minding it. There is nothing which temeritie doth not undertake, and which fortune doth not bring to paſſe; but when a man relyes on thoſe two guides, if he doth not erre, hee may erre; and of this ſort; even when the events are ſucceſsfull no glory is merited thereby. Every art hath its certain rules, which by infallible meanes lead to the ends propoſed; and provided that an Architect takes his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures right, he is aſſured of the beauty of his building. Beleeve not for all this, Reader, that I will conclude from thence my work is compleate, becauſe I have followed the rules which may render it ſo: I know that it is of this labour, as of the Mathematicall Sciences, where the opperation may fail, but the art doth never fail; nor doe I make this diſcourſe but to ſhew you, that if I have left ſome faults in my Book, they are the effects of my weakeneſs, and not of my negligence. Suffer mee then to diſcover unto you all the reſorts of this frame, and let you ſee, if not all that I have done, at leastwiſe all that I have indevored to doe.</p>
            <p>Whereas we cannot be knowing but of that which others do teach us, &amp; that it is for him that comes after, to follow them who preced him, I have beleeved, that for the laying the ground-plot of this work, we are to conſult with the Grecians, who have been our firſt Maſters, perſue the courſe which they have held, &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in imitating them to arrive at the ſame end, which thoſe great men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to themſelves. I have ſeen in thoſe famous <hi>Romanzes</hi> of antiquity, that in imitation of the Epique Poem there is a principall action whereunto all the reſt, which raign over all the work, are faſtned, and which makes them that they are not imployed, but for the conducting of it to its perfection. The action in <hi>Homers Iliades</hi> is the deſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> in his <hi>Odyſſeas</hi> the return of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes</hi> to <hi>Ithaca;</hi> in <hi>Uirgill</hi> the death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> or to ſay better, the conqueſt of <hi>Italy;</hi> neerer to our times, in <hi>Taſſo</hi> the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and to paſse from the Poem to the <hi>Romanze,</hi> which is my principall object, in <hi>Heliodorus</hi> the marriage of <hi>Theagines</hi> and <hi>Carielia.</hi> It is not becauſe the Epiſodes in the
<pb facs="tcp:60144:4"/> one, and the ſeverall Hiſtories in the other, are not rather beauties, than defects; but it is alwaies neceſſary, that the adreſs of him which imployes them ſhould hold them in ſome ſort to this principall action, to the end, that by this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious concatenation, all the parts of them ſhould make but one body, and that nothing may be ſeen in them which is looſe and unprofitable. Thus the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of my <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and his <hi>Iſabella,</hi> being the object which I have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto my ſelf, I have imployed all my care ſo to doe, that all the parts of my work may tend to that concluſion; that there may be a ſtrong connexion between them; and that, except the obſtacle which fortune oppoſeth to the deſires of my <hi>Heros,</hi> all things may advance, or at leſtwiſe indeavor to advance his mariage, which is the end of my labor. Now thoſe great Geniuſſes of antiquity, from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I borrow my light, knowing that well-ordering is one of the principall parts of a piece, have given ſo excellent a one to their ſpeaking pictures, that it would be as much ſtupididitie, as pride, not to imitate them. They have not done like thoſe Painters, who preſent in one and the ſame cloth a Prince in the Cradle, upon the Throne, &amp; in the Tombe, perplexing, by this ſo little judicious a confuſion, him, that conſiders their work; but with an incomparable adreſs they begin their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory in the middle, ſo to give ſome ſuſpence to the Reader, even from the firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the book; and to confine themſelves within reaſonable bounds they have made the Hiſtory (as I likewiſe have done after them) not to laſt above a year, the reſt being delivered by narration. Thus all things being ingeniouſly placed, and of a juſt greatneſs, no doubt but pleaſure will redound from thence to him that beholds them, and glory to him that hath done them. But amongſt all the rules which are to be obſerved in the compoſition of theſe workes, that of true reſemblance is without question the moſt neceſſary; it is, as it were, the fundamentall ſtone of this building, and but upon which it cannot ſubſiſt; without it nothing can move, without it nothing can pleaſe: and if this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming deceiver doth not beguile the mind in <hi>Romanzes,</hi> this kind of reading diſguſts, in ſtead of intertaining it: I have labored then never to eloigue my ſelf from it, and to that purpoſe I have obſerved the manners, cuſtomes, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and inclinations of people: And to give a more true reſemblance to things, I have made the foundations of my work Hiſtoricall, my principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages ſuch as are marked out in the true Hiſtory for illuſtrious perſons, and the warres effective. This is the way doubtleſs, whereby one may arrive at his end; for when as falſhood and truth are confounded by a dextrus hand, wit hath much adoe to diſintangle them, and is not eaſily carried to deſtroy that which pleaſeth it; contrarily, when as invention doth not make uſe of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, and that falſhood is produced openly, this groſs untruth makes no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſoul, nor gives any delight: As indeed how ſhould I bee touched with the misfortunes of the Queen of <hi>Gundaya,</hi> and of the King of <hi>Aſtroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> when as I know their very Kingdomes are not in the Vniverſall Mapp, or, to ſay better, in the being of things? But this is not the only defect which may carry us from true reſemblance, for we have at other times ſeen <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,</hi> which ſet before us monſters, in thinking to let us ſee Miracles; their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by adhering too much to wonders have made Groteſques, which have not a little of the viſions of a burning Feaver; and one might demand of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:60144:4"/> Meſsieurs with more reaſon, than the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> did of <hi>Arioſto,</hi> after he had read his <hi>Olando, Meſſer Lodovico done diavolo havete pigliato tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te coyonerie?</hi> As for me, I hold, that the more naturall adventures are, the more ſatisfaction they give; and the ordinary courſe of the Sun ſeemes more mervailous to me, than the ſtrange and deadly rayes of Comets; for which reaſon it is alſo that I have not cauſed ſo many Shipwracks, as there are in ſom antient <hi>Romanzes;</hi> and to ſpeak ſeriouſly <hi>Du Bartas</hi> might ſay of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<q>
                  <l>That with their word they bind,</l>
                  <l>Or looſe, at will, the blowing of the wind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So as one might think that <hi>Aeolus</hi> hath given them the Winds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncloſed in a bagg, as he gave them to <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> ſo patly doe they unchain them; they make tempeſts and ſhipwracks when they pleaſe, they raiſe them on the Pacifique Sea, they find rocks and ſhelves where the moſt expert Pilots have never obſerved any: But they which diſpoſe thus of the winds, know not, how the Prophet doth aſſure us, that God keepes them in his Treaſures; and that Philoſophy, as clear ſighted as it is, could never diſcover their retreat. Howbeit I pretend not hereby to baniſh Shipwracks from <hi>Romanzes,</hi> I approve of them in the workes of others, and make uſe of them in mine; I know likewiſe, that the Sea is the Scene moſt proper to make great changes in, and that ſome have named it the Theater of inconſtancie; but as all exceſs is vicious, I have made uſe of it but moderately, for to conſerve true reſembling: Now the ſame deſign is the cauſe alſo, that my <hi>Heros</hi> is not oppreſſed with ſuch a prodigious quantity of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as arrive unto ſome others, for that according to my ſenſe, the ſame is far from true reſemblance, the life of no man having ever been ſo croſt. It would be better in my oppinion to ſeparate the adventures, to form divers Hiſtories of them, and to make perſons acting, thereby to appear both fertile, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious together, and to be ſtill within this ſo neceſſary true reſemblance. And indeed they who have made one man alone defeat whole Armies, have forgotten the Proverb which ſaith, <hi>not one againſt two;</hi> and know not that antiquitie doth aſſure us, how <hi>Hercules</hi> would in that caſe be too weak. It is without all doubt, that to repreſent a true heroicall courage, one ſhould make it execute ſome thing extraordinary, as it were by a tranſport of the <hi>Heros;</hi> but he muſt not continue in that ſort, for ſo thoſe incredible actions would degenerate into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous fables, and never move the mind. This fault is the cauſe alſo of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting another; for they which doe nothing but heap adventure upon adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without ornament, and without ſtirring up paſſions by the artifices of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique, are irkeſome, in thinking to be the more intertayning. This dry nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and without a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i, hath more of an old Chronicle, than of a <hi>Romanze,</hi> which may very well be imbeliſhed with thoſe ornaments, ſince History, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and ſcrupulous as it is, doth not forbear imploying them. Certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, after they have deſcribed an adventure, a daring deſign, or ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing event, able to poſſeſs one with the braveſt apprehenſions in the world, are contented to aſſure us, that ſuch a <hi>Heros</hi> thought of very gallant things, without telling us what they are; and this is that alone which I deſire to know:

            <p>Certainly there is nothing more important in this kinde of compoſition, than ſtrongly to imprint the Idea, or (to ſay better) the image of the <hi>Heroes</hi> in the minde of the Reader, but in ſuch ſort, as if they were known to them; for that it is which intereſſeth him in their adventures, &amp; from thence his delight commeth; now to make them be known perfectly, it is not ſufficient to ſay how many times they have ſuffered ſhipwrack, and how times they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred robbers, but their inclinations muſt be made to appear by their diſcourſe: otherwiſe one may rightly apply to theſe dumb <hi>Heroes</hi> that excellent mot to of Antiquity, <hi>Speake that I may ſee thee.</hi> And if from true reſemblance, and inclinations, expreſſed by words, wee will paſs unto manners, goe from the pleaſant to the profitable, and from delight to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I am to tell you, Reader, that here vertue is ſeen to bee alwaies recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, and vice alwaies puniſhed, if he that hath followed his owne unrulineſs hath not by a juſt and ſenſible repentance obtained grace from Heaven; to which purpoſe I have alſo obſerved equality of manners in all the perſons that do act, unleſs it be whereas they are diſordered by paſſions, and touched with remorſe. I have had a care likewiſe to deal in ſuch ſort, as the faults, which great ones have committed in my Hiſtory, ſhould be cauſed either by love, or by ambition, which are the nobleſt of paſſions, and that they be imputed to the evill counſell of flatterers; that ſo the reſpect, which is alwaies due unto Kings, may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. You ſhall ſee there, Reader, if I be not deceived, the comlineſs of things and conditions exactly enough obſerved; neither have I put any thing into my
<pb facs="tcp:60144:5"/> Book which the Ladies may not read without bluſhing. And if you ſee not my <hi>Hero</hi> perſecuted with Love by Women, it is not becauſe he was not amiable, and that he could not be loved, but becauſe it would claſh with civility in the perſons of Ladies; and with true reſemblance in that of men, who rarely ſhew themſelves cruell unto them, nor in doing it could have any good grace: Finally, whether things ought to be ſo, or whether I have judged of my <hi>Hero</hi> by mine own weakneſs, I would not expoſe his fidelity to that dangerous tryall, but have been contented to make no <hi>Hilas,</hi> nor yet an <hi>Hipolitus</hi> of him. But whilſt I ſpeak of civilitie, it is fit I ſhould tell you (for fear I be accuſed of failing therein) that if you ſee throughout all my Work, when as <hi>Soliman</hi> is ſpoken unto, thy Highneſs, thy Majeſty, and that in concluſion he is treated with thee, and not with you, it is not for want of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And if the authority of the living may be of as much force, as that of the dead, you ſhall find examples of it in the moſt famous <hi>Othomans,</hi> and you ſhall ſee that their Authors have not been afraid to imploy in their own Tongue a manner of ſpeaking, which they have drawn from the Greek and Latin; and then too I have made it appear clearly, that I have not done it without deſign; for unleſs it be when as the Turks ſpeak to the Sultan, or he to his inferiors, I have never made uſe of it, and either of them doth uſe it to each other. Now for fear it may be objected unto me, that I have approached ſome incidents nearer than the Hiſtory hath ſhewed them to be, great <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhall be my warrant, who in his divine <hi>Aeneads</hi> hath made <hi>Dido</hi> appear four Ages after her own; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have beleeved I might do of ſome moneths, what he hath done of ſo many years, and that I was not to be afraid of erring, as long as I followed ſo good a guide. I know not likewiſe whether ſome may not take it ill, that my <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Heronia</hi> are not Kings; but beſides that the generous do put no difference between wearing of Crowns, and meriting them, and that my <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiniano</hi> is of a race which hath held the Empire of the Orient, the example of <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> me-thinks, ought to ſtop their mouthes, ſeeing <hi>Theogines</hi> and <hi>Charida</hi> are but ſimple Citizens. Finally, Reader, ſuch Cenſors may ſet their hearts at reſt for this particular, and leave me there, for I aſſure them, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> is of a condition to command over the whole Earth; and that <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> is of a Houſe, and Gentlewoman good enough, to make Knights of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> if ſhe have children enough for it, and that ſhe have a mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But ſetting this jeſting aſide, and comming to that which regards the Italian names, know that I have put them in their naturall pronounciation. And if you ſee ſome Turkiſh words, as <hi>Alla, Stamboll,</hi> the <hi>Egira,</hi> and ſome others, I have done it of purpoſe, Reader, and have left them as Hiſtoricall marks, which are to paſs rather for imbelliſhments than defects. It is certain that impoſition of names is a thing which every one ought to think of, and whereof nevertheleſs all the world hath not thought: We have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen Greek names given to barbarous Nations, with as little reaſon as if I ſhould name an Engliſh man <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that I ſhould call a Turk <hi>Anthony;</hi> for my part I have beleeved that more care is to be had of ones labour, and that upon this ſubject men and bookes are to be conſulted with;
<pb facs="tcp:60144:6"/> and if any one remarks the name of <hi>Satrape</hi> in this <hi>Romanze,</hi> let him not imagine that my ignorance hath confounded the antient and new <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that I have done it without Authority, I have an example thereof in <hi>Vigenere,</hi> who makes uſe of it in his Illuſtrations upon <hi>Calchondila;</hi> and I have learned it of a <hi>Perſian,</hi> which is at <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſaith, that by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpeech they call yet to this day the Governours of Provinces, <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Sitripin.</hi> Now leſt ſome other ſhould further accuſe me for having improperly named <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Houſe a Palace, ſince all thoſe of perſons of quality are called <hi>Seraglioes</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I deſire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I have done it by the counſell of two or three excellent perſons, who have found as well as my ſelf, that this name of <hi>Seraglio</hi> would leave an <hi>Idea</hi> which was not ſeemly, and that it was fit not to make uſe of it, but in ſpeaking of the Grand Signior, and that as ſeldom as might be. But whilſt wee are ſpeaking of a Palace, I am to advertiſe you, that ſuch as are not curious to ſee a goodly building, may paſs by the gate of that of my <hi>Heroe</hi> without entring into it, that is to ſay, not to read the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; it is not becauſe I have handled this matter like to <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> who playes the Maſon in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon;</hi> nor like <hi>Poliphile</hi> in his dreams, who hath ſet down moſt ſtrange terms, and all the dimenſions of Architecture, whereas I have imployed but the ornaments thereof; it is not becauſe they are not beauties ſutable to the <hi>Romanze,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Epique Poem,</hi> ſince the most famous both of the one and the other have them; nor is it too becauſe mine is not grounded on the Hiſtory, which aſſures us that it was the moſt ſuperb the Turks ever made, as ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the remains thereof, which they of that Nation call <hi>Serran Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi> But to conclude, as inclinations ought to be free, ſuch as love not thoſe beautifull things, for which I have ſo much paſſion, may (as I have ſaid) paſs on without looking on them, and leave them to others more curious of thoſe rarities, which I have aſſembled together with art and care enough. Now, Reader, ingenuity being a matter neceſſary for a man of Honour, and the theft of glory being the baſeſt that may be committed, I muſt confeſs here for fear of being accuſed of it, that the Hiſtory of the Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> which you ſhall ſee in my Book, is partly a Paraphraſe of <hi>Maſcardies;</hi> this Adventure falling out in the time whilſt I was writing, I judged it too excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent not to ſet it down, and too well indited for to undertake to do it better; ſo that regard not this place but as a Tranſlation of that famous Italian, and except the matters, which concern my Hiſtory, attribute all to that great man, whoſe Interpreter onely I am. And if you finde ſomething not very ſerious in the Hiſtories of a certain French Marquis, which I have interlaced in my Book, remember if you pleaſe, that a <hi>Romanze</hi> ought to have the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all natures; that this diverſity makes up the beauties of it, and the delight of the Reader; and at the worſt regard it as the ſport of a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and ſuffer it without blaming it. But before I make an end, I muſt paſs from matters to the manner of delivering them, and deſire you alſo not to forget, that a narrative ſtile ought not to be too much inflated, no more than that of ordinary converſations; that the more facile it is, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it is; that it ought to glide along like Rivers, and not rebound up like
<pb facs="tcp:60144:6"/> Torrents; and that the leſs conſtraint it hath, the more perfection it hath; I have endeavoured then to obſerve a juſt mediocrity between vicious elevation, and creeping lowneſs; I have contained my ſelf in narration, and left my ſelf free in orations, and in paſſions, and without ſpeaking as extravagants, and the vulgar, I have laboured to ſpeak as worthy perſons do.</p>
            <p>Behold, Reader, that which I had to ſay to you, but what defence ſoever I have imployed, I know that it is of works of this nature, as of a place of war, where notwithſtanding all the care the Engineer hath brought to fortifie it, there is alwayes ſome weak part found, which he hath not dream'd of, and whereby it is aſſaulted; but this ſhall not ſurprize me; for as I have not forgot that I am a man, no more have I forgot that I am ſubject to erre.</p>

All the people ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the <hi>Hipodrome,</hi> and the leaſt curious would ſee the magnificent entry of that Prince, who returned conquerer from <hi>Perſia. Roxelana</hi> the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen, followed by all the reſt, parted from the Seraglio in Chariots of Scarlet imbroidered with gold, and went to the ſtately ſtanding prepared for her. All the Chriſtian Princes Ambaſſadors took their places there; firſt that of the Emperor; then that of <hi>France;</hi> next to them ſate thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> and after them the <hi>Baglioes</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Rhagouſa.</hi> But thoſe of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Provinces, as being of the ſame belief with <hi>Soliman,</hi> were on the left hand, which amongſt the Turkes is alwaies the place of honour: That of the <hi>Tartars</hi> appeared there with a barbarous pomp in a Cap and Roab of Sables, all his Train clad with the skinnes of Beares, Foxes, Wolves, and Tygers: And thoſe of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> were there too, with all the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and gallantry, that Moores make profeſſion of. As ſoone as each one had taken his place, the Governor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom the Turkes call <hi>Capitan Baſſa,</hi> and as one of the four prime Officers of the Empire, went out of the City to the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio Daut, an houſe of pleaſure of the Grand Signiors, ſome two miles off, for to advertiſe his Higneſs, who was come thither the night before, that all things were in a readineſs to receive him. <hi>Soliman</hi> gets imediately to horſe, and this great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour after ſo glorious a conqueſt goes to revive the ſtately ſeat of his Empire. Fifty Trumpets, and fifty Atabales, attired in Caſſocks of Damask, imbroidered with gold, appeared firſt in the <hi>Hipodrome,</hi> and made all the Cittie to ring with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60144:8"/> the warlike harmony of their ſilver inſtruments. They were followed by two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Archers on horsback, in liveries of carnation ſattin, laid thick with gold lace. Bowes of ebony in their left hands, and ivory quivers hanging on skarfes. Fifty Hoboys, and fifty players on Cimballs, followed this firſt troup, habited after the Greek faſhion, in blew velvet imbroidered with ſilver. The <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> marched on foot alone after them in the head of ſix thouſand of his companions, having on a robe of cloth of gold, a jewell of rich ſtones, and a plume of Hearons feathers in his Turbant, with a China battoon in his hand, which is the marke of his Charge: All this Troop was clothed in that kind of roabe by them called <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> with ſcymitars by their ſides, and muskets on their ſhoulders. They were followed by fifty Drummes, and fifty Fyfes, attyred in ſhort coates of white taffeta, wrought with lively flowers ſet out with gold. After them an hundred black Slaves, with chaines of ſilver, and braſlets of the ſame about their armes and leggs, carried <hi>Tachmas</hi> the Sophy of <hi>Perſiaes</hi> Throne of maſſy gold, which had been found in <hi>Tauris;</hi> and all the rich veſſell of Agate, and Turqueys, wherewith that Monarch was ſerved. Next to them were twelve Elephants, and twelve Camells led, laden with ſilver, gold, jewells, and precious ſtones, which had been taken out of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyes Treaſure. A great Chariot, drawn by twelve Barbes, followed, where hung an hundred diſplayed colours, which the Turkes had gained from the <hi>Perſians;</hi> in the midſt whereof was a ſtately Trophey, compoſed of Curiaces and Murrians of ſilver engraved; Targets of gold and Turqueyſes; Scymitars and Poignards, whoſe hilts and ſcabba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirty Satrapes, ſumptuouſly apparelled after the Perſian manner, with their Cuſelbas, or red Turbants, went after that Chariot, tyed two and two with golden chaines, their hands behind their backs. Theſe illuſtrious wretches were followed by five hundred Voluntiers, which the Turkes call <hi>Dellis,</hi> mounted on horſes barbed and capariſoned with Lions skinnes, having the tail of that generous beaſt on the frontſtalls of them, in ſtead of a feather; their habits were of the skin of a Bear, their bonnets of that of a Leopard exquiſitely ſpotted; in thoſe bonnets the trayne of an Eagle, and on their Targetts the wing of the ſame bird; they had ſcymitars by their ſides, battelaxes at their ſaddle bowes, and Launces in their hands, at the end whereof was an Eagles feather in ſtead of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. This fantaſtick troop was followed by a mixture of Trumpets, Attabales, Hoboyes, European Drummes, Cimballs, and Fyfes, which compoſed a muſick lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs extravagant, than the equipage of thoſe that preceded them. An hundred Pages rode after theſe ſame, mounted on white Barbes, and ſuited in vvhite velvet, ſtudded vvith ſilver.

Next to theſe horſes marched even together the <hi>Tubenter Aga,</hi> and the <hi>Chiodar Aga,</hi> vvho carried the Turbant and Mantle Imperiall. Behind them <hi>Ibrahim Baſſa,</hi> the the Grand Viſior, rode alone, mounted on a black Barbe, vvhoſe furniture vvas of velvet of the ſame color, as vvell as the habit of that illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> all imbroidered vvith great pearles, he carried in his hand, &amp; vvithout a Scabbard, the Scymitar Imperiall. The hundred Peikes, or footmen of the Grand Signior, follovved next, but in order, vvith bonnets of maſſive ſilver on their heads, in the midſt vvherof vvhite feathers of an extraordinary greatneſs ſtuck in a quill covered vvith precious ſtones. Fifty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers on foot vvent after them, vvith bovves &amp; arrovves in their hands, in the midſt of whom was <hi>Sultan Soliman,</hi> arrayed in a roabe of cloth of gold, imbroidered vvith pearles, and diamonds; his Turbant vvas ardorned vvith five plumes of Hearons, and as many great jevvells of rich ſtones; and the furniture of his Horſe vvas all

After whom a Boluch Baſſa marched in the head of two thouſand Janizaries, which were the laſt Troops of this ſtately Entrie. After that this marvelous Triumph had made a turn about the Hipodrome, all ranked themſelves on the right and left hand, and the Sultan went and lighted at a Tent of cloth of Gold, vvhich had been pitched for him under the windows of the Sultana Queen. All the Grandees of the Port ſtood on both ſides; <hi>Ibrahim</hi> alone was ſet at his Highneſs feet, on a Cuſhion of cloath of Silver. When every one had taken his place, the Baſſa of the Sea, who that day exerciſed the Charge of the Maſter of the Ceremonies, advertiſed the Ambaſſadors that they might go to the Baiſe-main, and offer their preſents, which they had no ſooner done, and were returned to their ſeats, but the Mufti appeared, ſitting on a Throne that was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the back of a Cammell, and holding in his hands the Book of the Alcoran. He was waited upon by all the Alfaquis, Calenders, and Dervis of the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> all theſe Religious men cried and howled with a dreadfull poiſe, and to accompany their voices, and their dance, they beat upon kettles and baſons, and rung little bels; ſo that this modeſt Clergy reſembled not a little the Orgies of antient <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Bacchanals of old <hi>Rome:</hi> When they were before the Sultan they ſtood ſtill, made prayers for the proſperity of his Highneſs, offered him a Book of their Law, covered with Gold and Turqueſyes; and after they had ſlaſhed their arms and their faces with great knives, for the love of their Prophet, and the Sultan, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and gave place to thoſe that were to ſucceed them. The Turkiſh, Chriſtian, and Jewiſh Merchants appeared then richly attired, and in the midſt of them a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot drawn by twelve <hi>Cupids,</hi> crowned with flowers, upon the which was erected a ſhop of cloth of Gold, and Perſian Tapeſtry, which they preſented to the Sultan. The Goldſmiths followed them with a Cupbord of Gold Plate ingraven, upon a frame of unpoliſhed Silver, dravvn by four white Horſes, which they gave to his Highneſs. Every Trade appeared one after another, each of them making ſhew of ſome rich piece of workmanſhip of their profeſſion; but with ſo extraordinary a diligence, that before the turn of the place was finiſhed, the Preſent was in eſtate to be offered to great <hi>Soliman.</hi> He received them all very graciouſly, and inſtantly gave them to his dear <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to whom he ſaid they were juſtly due, ſince it was by his courage and conduct, that he had obtained the Victory, and this Triumph. After that all theſe liberall Troopes were paſt, as <hi>Turkie</hi> is the onely place in the World, vvhere the moſt Juglers and Tumblers are, there appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove tvvo thouſand of them, vvho in the preſence of the Grand Signior did all, that the ſleight of the hand, and all, that the addreſs and force of the body, could naturally permit men to.

Amongſt theſe Slaves there vvas one in the Turkiſh Troop, vvhich by his good aſpect and behaviour, drevv the eys of all the beholders upon him; the Grand Viſier no ſooner perceived him, but he trembled vvith amazement and joy, no way doubting but that it was he whom he thought he knew: In the mean time the Frame, and the two Troops, having made a turn about the place, the City was ſet down juſt againſt the Grand Signior, and the Perſians caſt themſelves into it; Then at the ſound of all the Trumpets, Atabales, Drums, Hoboys, Fifes, and Cimbals in the Aſſembly, the Turks gave an aſſault to that feigned City of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60144:9"/> 
                  <hi>Tauris:</hi> If the aſſault were vigorous, the defence was no leſs; the Perſians were ſeen to give ground; the Turkes were alſo ſeen to be repulſed; and this falſe Image of of war had all the apparences of a true fight: But at length, after a great reſiſtance, the well-made Slave forced the gates, mounted firſt on the walles, and plucking down the Sophyes Colours for to ſet up thoſe of the Sultan, his valor and addreſs were the cauſe, that the Moon made the Sun to be eclipſed; his victory was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with a great ſhout of the Janizaries, and of all the people, and nothing was heard over all the Hipodrome, but long live Sultan <hi>Soliman.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Baſſa, who knew his friend no leſs by his addreſs, than by his face, was raviſhed to ſee, that all the glory of this action could not be diſputed with him. When the noiſe of ſo many voices was diſperſed, there appeared a Troop like to Chriſtians, and obſerved for ſuch by the Croſſes, which were ſeen in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; they repreſented certain Chriſtians, who living under the Empire of the Sophy thought they were obliged to defend that Prince, though he were not of their Religion, and indeed had fought ſo generouſly for him, as they had been the firſt in the war, and yet the laſt that were vanquiſhed. This feigned Troop had order from the Baſſa of the Sea to reſiſt for ſome time that of the Turkes, which came at that very inſtant out of the Citty, and then to ſuffer themſelves to be vanquiſhed; and they that vvere attired like Turkes were commanded to chain them, and to trail their Colours on the ground: But when the fight began, that generous Slave, vvho had dravvn the eyes of all the Aſſembly upon him at the taking of the feigned Citty of <hi>Tauris,</hi> fell ſuddenly from jeſting into a more ſerious thought, and being carried avvay by the zeal of his Religion, he paſſed from the Turkiſh Troop into that of the Chriſtians, and by changing of party made the face of things to change: The Turkes, whom he had left, laboured to vanquiſh him with the reſt, but he beat them back to the very gates of the City; and albeit they made three ſallies more upon him, he repulſed them all the three times, even to the ſame gates. All the world was ſurpriſed with this adventure, and <hi>Soliman,</hi> not being able to comprehend the matter, demanded of the Baſſa of the Sea, what it meant? But the Baſſa, caſting himſelf at the feet of his Highneſs, aſſured him that this criminall action came not from his order, but that it proceeded from the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of his Slave; whereupon a motion of choler ſeizing on the mind of the Grand Signior, he commanded that this Slave ſhould be inſtantly impaled. But the grand Vifier, riſing from the place where he ſate, and falling on his knees, beſought the Sultan that he would not mark the day of his Triumph with blood; but remember that clemency is properly the vertue of the Victorious; that in ſaving the life of this inconſiderate he ſhould be aſſured, that he would loſe it for his ſervice; and that he was of a birth and humor never to be ingratefull; that knowing him as well as himſelf, he would be reſponſable for him to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that being ſo far obliged unto him as to dye for to ſave him, he beſought the Sultan to take his life inſtead of his, if his fault could not obtain pardon. <hi>Soliman</hi> reached out his hand to the illuſtrious Baſſa, and in raiſing him up, ſaid unto him, that were the Lightning in his hand, his prayers ſhould arreſt it; and that being unable to refuſe him any thing, he granted him both the life and the pardon of that raſh man. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> caſt himſelf again at the feet of the Sultan for to render him thanks, and after he had obtained of the Baſſa of the ſea that this ſlave ſhould come and paſs the night with him, he ſent him a commandment to attend him. All the magnificences of this Triumph being finished, <hi>Soliman</hi> was going to riſe, and to prepare himſelf for his return unto his Seraglio, when as he perceived <hi>Oſman,</hi> the Baſſa of the ſeas onely ſonne, who breaking through the preſs, and leading a woman in his hand, came and threw himſelf together with her at his feet. I know well, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, that my preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is extreme, but withall I know too, that thy goodneſs is infinite; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I have no other need of it in this encounter, than that thou wilt be pleaſed to permit me to acknowledge thee for a Judge, and to obtain of thee, that in a day wherein thou receiveſt ſuch glorious marks of thy Valour, thou wilt render us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60144:9"/> one of thy Juſtice. The Baſſa of the ſea knowing that he was the moſt intereſſed in the matter in hand, approached near to the Grand Signior for to beſeech him with a great deal of earneſtneſs not to give ear to the complaints of a man, who had been ſo bold as to come and interrupt his Triumph; that for his part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were his ſonne, he would crave no favour of him for his fault, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily he ſhould be obliged to his Highneſs if he would give him a chaſtiſement, that might puniſh him, not only for his crime, but for all others whereof he was alſo culpable. A diſcourſe ſo violent, and ſo far diſtant from the apprenſions of a father, made <hi>Soliman</hi> willing to be cleared therein, being loth in a day of his glory his people might ſay, that he had refuſed to hear the complaint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Howbeit he would firſt demand the advice of the grand Viſier <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who having no other aim but the glory of his Maſter, ſaid unto him, that in a time wherein Heaven had done him juſtice in giving him the victory over his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, he ſhould in ſome ſort be unjuſt to deny it to them that craved it of him. The firſt ſence of <hi>Soliman</hi> having been confirmed by the counſell of a man, who might do all things with him, he commanded the Baſſa of the ſea to hold his peace, and the woman whom <hi>Oſman</hi> had brought to his feet, to tell him what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhe had in the fortune of that man; to the end that underſtanding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a perſon that ſeemed leaſt capable of diſguiſing it, he might alſo give a more equall judgement therein. That woman then having heard this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not for all that reſolve to obey it, before ſhe had looked on <hi>Oſman,</hi> as it were to demand permiſſion of him to anſwer unto it; but he having made a ſign unto her that he deſired it, ſhe turned her ſelf towards <hi>Soliman,</hi> with both a modeſt, and a confident countenance, which began already to obtain for her the good-will and attention of all that could hear her. <hi>Alibech,</hi> ſo was this vvoman called, was young and fair, and one might have ſaid that her beauty had been without compare, if her complexion had not been a little tanned with the Sun; ſhe had a ſtately look, but without pride, and ſuch ingenuity in her face, as could not permit one to doubt of her words. After that by <hi>Oſmans</hi> countenance ſhe knew he had permitted her to ſpeak, ſhe began in theſe terms; for though ſhe was originally of <hi>Perſia,</hi> yet ſpake ſhe perfectly the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> tongue, which ſhe made uſe of in this occaſion.</p>

                  <p>I doubt not, my Lord, but thy Highneſs will find it ſtrange, ſaid this woman, her eyes full of tears, that in a day wherein tears of joy are to be ſhed, I begin my diſcourſe with tears of ſorrow; but the cauſe of it is ſo preſſing, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to retain them; for, my Lord, thou ſeeſt before thine eyes, ſayd ſhe, ſhewing <hi>Oſman,</hi> two of the moſt infortunate perſons that ever were; we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies whom we cannot, whom we ought not hate; to whom we ow reſpect; to whom we ow obedience; to whom we ow affection; enemies, I ſay, to whom we ow our lives, and for whom alſo we would loſe them with joy if there vvere oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it: Nevertheleſs it is againſt ſuch dear perſons, my Lord, that I am to ſpeak at this time; and for obtaining the juſtice which we demand of thee, and whereupon depends the happineſs or unhappineſs of our lives, I muſt diſcover the cruelties of my father, and <hi>Oſman</hi> muſt accuſe his: Judge then, my Lord, whether my tears be not juſt, and whether loving our enemies, as we do, we be not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to an extreme misfortune in being thus conſtrained to publiſh their ſhame, to accuſe them, and to demand juſtice againſt them. <hi>Alibech</hi> found her ſelf ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed vvith ſorrow, that ſhe ſtood a good while unable to ſpeak. But <hi>Soliman</hi> having commended ſo ſweet a reſentment in her, and having commanded her once again to let him underſtand their differences, ſhe continued her diſcourſe. Since I muſt, ſayd ſhe, obey, and that I cannot conſerve my husband without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the misfortunes of my father, I muſt, I ſay, let thy Highneſs know, that his name is <hi>Arſalon;</hi> that he was born the ſubject of the Sophy of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and that in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60144:10"/> the time he was in that Court he was Satrap of <hi>Aderbion,</hi> and ſo conſiderable vvith <hi>Tachmas,</hi> as there was not any perſon in that Empire, vvho vvas more than he; but whereas his humour hath been alwayes violent in every thing, being become deſperately in love with a maid of excellent beauty, of great vertue, and of much ſpirit, he eſpouſed her, though ſhe were of baſe condition: And whereas the Laws of the State do not permit a Gentleman to mary a wife that is not noble, they alſo will that the great ones, which commit ſuch like offences, ſhall loſe the honors and charges they poſſeſs, and be declared ignoble, and uncapable of all manner of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. My father was not ignorant of this cuſtom and law; but he was perſwaded that <hi>Tachmas</hi> would have infringed it for his ſake; and if he would not, that want of affection would be a reaſon ſtrong enough to oblige him to make the Province re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, where he commanded, and whereof he believed he was abſolutely the Maſter; howbeit the matter ſucceeded not ſo, for the enemies which my Father had made him by his violences, meeting with ſo fair an occaſion to hurt him, they repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Sophy, that if he pardoned him this fault, it would make him the more inſolent for the future, yea and that it would even overthrow all that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the glory and force whereof conſiſted in the valour of noble perſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is repleniſhed; at length they wrote in ſuch manner, that my Father was declared guilty, as contravening the fundamentall Laws of the State, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to undergo the chaſtiſement, which I ſhall come to ſpeak of, by reaſon that the Province, where he commanded ſo abſolutely when he was in grace, revolted againſt him, and left him not ſcarcely the liberty to ſeek a refuge otherwhere; for I forgot to tell thy Highneſs, that the ſame Law which commanded the utter ruine of my Father, commanded alſo that he ſhould paſs his life in a perpetuall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the perſon whom he had maried in another, for fear that living together, and having children, it might one day cauſe diſorders in the State. My Father ſeeing himſelf in ſo pitifull a fortune, went not about to move the heart of <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> with payers and ſubmiſſion, but contrarily ſent him word, that deſerving not to be ſerved by a man of his courage and valor, he vvould go out of his Eſtates, vvith an intention never to re-enter into them again, but to bring war along with him. Being then in <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> he bought a Man of War, wherein he imbarqued himſelf on <hi>Mare major,</hi> with his vvife, who as ſhe was the cauſe of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſo would ſhe not abandon him in his exile. They continued ſome time in this ſort, not knowing what reſolution to take, nor having any other deſign in the courſe that they held, than to cloign themſelves from <hi>Perſia;</hi> my Fathers great heart not permitting him to go and ſeek unto the enemies of <hi>Tachmas</hi> for a place of retreat; for though he be ſomewhat cruell, yet is he notwithſtanding generous; neither would he likewiſe addreſs himſelf to the Princes that were allied to our Empire, for fear he ſhould not be favourably received by them. In the mean time theſe irreſolutions having no end, the proviſions of the ſhip diminiſhed daily: The Pilot was well hoped up to ask him where he would land, vvhen as he found no place in the vvhole univerſall Map vvhither ro go. Six moneths paſt avvay in this ſort in running over all the Seas of the <hi>Levant;</hi> and whereas my mother was with child of me, at ſuch time as ſhe imbarqued her ſelf, ſhe was not far from the term wherein I was to ſee the light, when as <hi>Arſalons</hi> victualls utterly failed him; and having imployed all his money in the buying of the Veſſell, and ſuch proviſions of War, and for the mouth, as he had laid into her, he knew not what part to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto for the ſupplying of himſelf in ſo adverſe an adventure. The ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Mariners conſulted together, and having gained the Pilot, they wrought ſo with him, that maugre the command my Father had given him to the contrary, he ſteered directly to an Iland which they had diſcovered; whereupon <hi>Arſalon</hi> being in a rage to ſee his authority contemned, went and puſhed away the Pilot ſo rudely for to make him abandon the helm, as the poor wretch fell into the Sea; and my Father becoming his own Pilot, he took his ſcimitar in his right hand, and the whip of the rudder in his left, and menacing them that would oppoſe his will, he made his Veſſell take a quite contrary courſe, chooſing rather to die by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60144:10"/> famine, than expoſe his miſery to the eyes of the world, fearing nothing ſo much as that <hi>Tachmas</hi> ſhould come to underſtand his misfortunes. He had already loſt ſight of that Hand, which he had beheld as a rock, and his ſouldiers being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger retained but by the tears of my Mother, might at length peradventure have been carried to ſome ſtrange reſolution, without an adventure that befell them, which was, that my Father diſcovered a Veſſell comming towards his, which bare a Flag of <hi>Perſia</hi> in her top, as he thought, and as indeed it proved to be: Upon the ſight of her he began to think, that he ſhould be revenged of <hi>Tachmas</hi> in reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf upon his Subjects; and this deſire of revenge, joyned to the preſent neceſſity, made him propound to his ſouldiers the attacquing of that Veſſell, who animated more by the fear of famine, than by their courage, reſolved to obey his pleaſure. After my Father had ſhut up my Mother in the Captains Cabbin, where with fright ſhe was brought to bed of me by the aſſiſtance of her Nurſe, who had never abandoned her, they ſet upon the Veſſell, and after two hours fight rendred themſelves abſolute Maſters of her, wherein they found extreme riches, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Victuall. This victory gave new life to his ſouldiers, who for the valor which my Father had ſhewed in this occaſion, grew ſo devoted unto him, as they craved pardon of him for reſiſting his will, and ſwore never to forſake him; he to win them the more, divided the booty amongſt them, reſerving nothing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but the glory of having vanquiſhed. After this, my Lord, he took a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have no other Countrey but his ſhip, and to paſs all the reſt of his life upon all the Seas of the world, to ſeek out all occaſions of fighting, and to take all the Veſſells that ſhould carry the Colours of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or all that belonged to the Enemies of our Religion, which are the Chriſtians: He propounds this deſign to his ſoudiers, who approve it, and albeit my Mother withſtood it, he ſetled this reſolution at laſt. Behold, my Lord, in what ſort my Father hath lived for the ſpace of eighteen years that I have been in the world, and that which hath gotten him ſo much fame under the name of <hi>Arſalon</hi> the Pirate throughout all the Seas that are known to us. I have not for all that been always brought up in ſo wild an element, for whereas he divers times arrived at Hands to ſell off the commodities which he had taken, he left me from the age of ſix years untill fourteen, at which time he took me to him again, under the government of a woman of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who truly had a great deal of care of me. Thy Highneſs may be pleaſed to diſpence with me for the relating to thee all the ſad victories which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath obtained in ſo long a time, and withall wilt pardon me if I have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſelf in this diſcourſe more than I ought, for to make it appear, that the life which my father hath led, hath rather been an effect of his great heart, and of his deſpair, than of the baſeneſs and viciouſneſs of his mind: But, my Lord, to come unto that which directly regards me, it was not full ſix dayes after my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had taken me away from the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whenas my Mother fell ſick, and died in my arms; this loſs no doubt was very ſenſible unto me, and <hi>Arſalon</hi> was ſo afflicted with it, as no man could be more; howbeit this grief produced very different effects in us; I ſhed tears, and he ſpilt blood, for melancholy being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his violent humour, he ſought no other remedy for his affliction than to make others miſerable like him ſelf. We ran then over all the Archipelago, and all the Sea of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and during that voyage he made many fights, and took many prizes, amongſt the reſt a little Barque, where a man of a good aſpect, and that was an <hi>Italian,</hi> defended himſelf ſo couragiouſly, that <hi>Arſalon,</hi> vex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, had peradventure cauſed him to be ſlain, if I had not obtained his life. When he was in the hands of my Father, he was chained amongſt thoſe whom he judged were handſome enough to be ſold in places where he had accuſtomed to traffique; but he ſoon changed this deſign, for this new Slave having given him to underſtand by an Interpreter, which my Father had, who ſpoke moſt languages, for the commodity of his Commerces, that he was a man of quality, he agreed with him on a price for his ranſom, and gave him his word, that if the ſum which he had promiſed, were paid him at the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he would ſet him at liberty:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60144:11"/> This Slave having confirmed this promiſe unto him, my Father permitted him to write unto the place whence he ſaid he was of, and ſo going to the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he gave this Letter to Merchants, with whom he held correſpondence, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to cauſe it to be delivered; my Father promiſing this Slave, that within three moneths he would return thither for an anſwer of it; but in the mean time that he muſt for his ſecurity go along with him: This man not knowing what to do, but to follow the Law of the Vanquiſher, reſolved to ſubmit to that which he could not avoid. Not long after we encountred a great man of War, in whoſe Flag my Father obſerved half Moons; and whereas all his prizes were ſeldom or never made of any ſave of <hi>Perſians,</hi> or Chriſtians, he purpoſed not to meddle with her, but contrarily commanded his Pilot to quit his courſe, that ſo he might decline her; but whereas <hi>Arſalon</hi> was taken for a Pirate, and this change of courſe ſeemed to be a flight unto him who commanded that Veſſell, he made up with full ſayls unto us, the better to diſcern ours, and having well diſcerned her, he came preſently and grapled himſelf faſt unto us. I cannot ſay, my Lord, what this fight was, becauſe the fright I was in kept me from marking it, howbeit I know that at the very firſt, they of that Veſſell leaped into ours; and whereas there were many of my Fathers ſouldiers ſick, they might peradventure have rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of her without the valor of the <hi>Italian</hi> Slave, who ſeeing that they which attacqued us were not Chriſtians, demanded leave of <hi>Arſalon</hi> to fight, who having given him arms, gave him wherewithall to gain us the victory; for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſuch marvellous things in this fight, as after he had repulſed the enemy, he leaped into their Veſſell, followed by my Father, and ſome of his, put very neer all that he met with there to the ſword, rendred himſelfe Maſter of her, and with his own hand, after a long reſiſtance, took <hi>Oſman,</hi> who commanded her, and who by his Fathers order was going to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> After this brave exploit, this Slave was the favourite of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> of which grace notwithſtanding he was not much ſenſible; for though my Father careſſed him extremely, yet left he not to be exceedingly afflicted, when as he knew that the reward of his victories ſhould be a perpetuall ſlavery; for albeit my Father had promiſed to give him his liberty, when as he ſhould have received his ranſom, he had reſolved nevertheleſs to break his word with him, for that he might not, ſaid he, part with a man which could make him invincible by his wonderfull valor. In the mean time, my Lord, <hi>Oſman</hi> finding himſelf wounded, and my inclination having always carried me to the comforting of others miſeries, I viſited him whilſt he was ill, and more for the care that I had of his perſon, as long as he was ſo, than for any beauty vvas in my face, he bare an affection to me; and if I dare ſay it, the knovvledge vvhich I had thereof, together with his merit, and the compaſſion I had of his misfortune, very much diſpoſed me to accept of it; the conſtancy which he ſhewed was partly the cauſe of my weakneſs, if at leaſtwiſe one may call an affection ſo, which hath no other object but vertue. As ſoon as <hi>Oſman</hi> was taken, he told <hi>Arſalon</hi> what he was, who gave him the means to let the Baſſa of the Sea underſtand what ranſom he was ſet at, and how he might deliver him; in the mean time, his hurts being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he contracted a great friendſhip with that generous Slave, ſpeaking a certain corrupted <hi>Italian</hi> unto him, which, they ſay, is very much in uſe here in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> As for me, after I parted from the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> my chiefeſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens was to talk with the Interpreter, whom my Father carried always along with him, and by the continuall conference which we had together, touching the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Languages, I had almoſt learned two or three, if not for to ſpeak them well, at leaſtwiſe to underſtand them perfectly; and whereas the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> were of that number, I did alſo many times converſe with thoſe two infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ones, thinking I had paſſed away the day exceeding well, vvhen I could avoid the company of thoſe men of blood and ſlaughter that follovved my Father. Thus I ſpent moſt of my time, either in the Captains Cabbin vvith my Mothers Nurſe, or in their converſation. They knevv vvell enough by my ſadneſs, that the life vvhich I led vvas grievous unto me, yet had they the goodneſs not to ſpeak to me
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60144:11"/> of it but modeſtly, nor to complain of their own misfortunes in conſideration of me: This compliance and adviſedneſs of theirs made me to eſteem much of them both; and the belief I had that I was beloved of <hi>Oſman</hi> poſſeſſed me both with joy, and with unquietneſs; for I perceived ſufficiently, that his heart yielded not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſting, and that he was aſhamed to wear the fetters of a Pirats daughter: This generous diſpoſition of his for all that diſpleaſed me not, and making great account of him already, I interpreted every thing to his advantage; I found that he had reaſon to revolt againſt himſelf, and not to give way to a paſſion unworthy of him, yet forbore I not to make vowes in ſecret, that he might know how far my diſpoſition was from that of my fathers, but yet I durſt not bring any care to juſtifie my ſelf therein, becauſe I could not do it without blaming him that gave me life. Wee lived in this ſort with ſome delight, and a great deale of unquietneſs; the Italian Slave was afflicted to ſee my father break his word with him, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alſo to be ſo for that he could have no tydings of a friend of his whom he infinitely regretted; as for <hi>Oſman,</hi> and my ſelf, we knew not what to wiſh for; he was grieved for that he could not hear from his father, and yet feared to quit me; I likewiſe made vows for his liberty, and yet feared nothing more. What, ſaid I to my ſelf ſometimes, ſhall I paſs my whole life with men, whoſe cruelty is all their vertue? ſhall I alwaies be expoſed to tempeſts? Shall I never ſee other than miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretches? And it may be too after that I ſhall die the Slave of a Pirate. I vow to thee, my Lord, this thought was a torment unto me; and albeit the converſation of <hi>Oſman</hi> gave me ſome pleaſing houres, yet could I ſay that I was moſt unhappy: But I was a great deal more a little after, becauſe the term, which my father had given the Baſſa of the Sea for the redemption of his ſonne, being paſt, he was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more harſhly than before, and kept in the rank of thoſe Slaves, which he meant to ſell in Chriſtian land. This reſolution, being known to <hi>Oſman,</hi> and me, wrought a ſtrange effect in us, and the love which we bore one to another, and which we had both of us concealed as much as we could, began then to break forth. I could not ſpeak to him of my fathers deſigns but with tears in mine eys, nor could he talk to me of an eloignment, which he believed to be inevitable, without declaring his affection openly unto me; I believed, my Lord, that it was true, thinking it was not a time fitting to diſſemble in; he aſſured me that his irons did not ſeem heavy unto him, as long as he was with me, but the thought of being ſeparated from me for ever, and to be conſtrained to carry chaines otherwhere, was inſupportable to to him; he ſware to me further, that he had not deſired his liberty but to obtain of his father, againſt whom he had never ſo much as once murmured, the meanes to deliver me out of the hands of mine. A diſcourſe ſo obliging found not an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul, and I reſolved to do what I could to keep my father from executing ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble a deſign; I caſt my ſelf then at his feet, I begged this grace of him with teares, but for all the effect of my requeſt I got nothing, ſave an expreſs inhibition never to ſpeak to him more of it. After that he alwaies treated me ill; I had no longer the libertie to entertain <hi>Oſman</hi> as before; and wee were all three for a long time together the moſt unhappy perſons that ever were. This conſtraint for all that kept me not from letting him know at length, that if he would promiſe to mary me I would undeavour to deliver him, ſo as he would be ruled by me: <hi>Oſman</hi> anſwered thereunto very obligingly, that loving me ſo much, as to hazard his life for to make me his, I was not to doubt, but that meeting with two ſuch great benefits together, he would do whatſoever I would have him for to obtain them. After he had ſworn more than once to me, that if I would procure him his libertie, and would follow him, he would receive me for his wife, I required ſome time for the execution of my deſign; but whereas I could not finiſh it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying in ſome ſort my father, it is certain that I almoſt repented me of my ingaging my ſelf therein: I was perſwaded notwithſtanding that vertue and reaſon were of my ſide, and that regarding <hi>Oſman</hi> as my husband, I might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to follow him, deſiring nothing of all my fathers riches, than this only Slave, which I robbed him of. Being well confirmed then in my deſign, I examin, I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60144:12"/> the difficulties of it, and find no other way to execute it, than to ſtay till we came to the Iſle of <hi>Chio,</hi> whither my father was to goe, and there to caſt anchor; for whereas he had cauſed the Captains Cabbin to be divided in the midſt, to the end that I ſhould lie on the one ſide, and he on the other, and that <hi>Oſman</hi> alſo was every night locked up with a key, which <hi>Arſalon</hi> himſelf alwaies kept by him, I reſolved to ſteal it as ſoftly as I could from him; but the difficulty was, that ever ſince he purpoſed to retain the Italian Slave, he for to favour him, but indeed to aſſure himſelf of him, made him to lie with him. I reſolved then to propound unto him his eſcaping out of my fathers hands; at firſt he doubted it was but to try him, that I ſpake ſo to him, and withall his own generoſity withſtood it, but having acquainted him with the truth of the matter, he believed me, and ſaid, that ſeeing my father had broken his word with him, he might fail in his fidelity to him alſo; and on condition that <hi>Oſman</hi> would promiſe him his freedom, he would expoſe himſelf to any thing for my ſake. I aſſured him of what he deſired, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo good a ſecond it was not hard for me to finiſh my enterpriſe. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out importuning thy Highneſs, my Lord, by a long relation, let it ſuffiſe to ſay, we were no ſooner at the road of <hi>Chio,</hi> where <hi>Oſman</hi> had ſome acquaintance, but night being come, and my father a ſleep, I went and ſtole away the key of the Cabbin, wherein <hi>Oſman</hi> was lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, my Lord, after I had delivered <hi>Oſman</hi> with the help of the generous Slave, and had brought him back to his paternall houſe, when he would have made good his word which he had given us, this incenſed father hath intreated me as an infamous perſon, and a vagabond, and hath put that Slave into irons, to whom his ſonne oweth his liberty, ſince that without him I could not have executed that which I had promiſed; it is that Slave, my Lord, whom thou haſt ſo lately pardoned, and of whom the Illuſtrious <hi>Ibrahim</hi> hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the protection. Behold, my Lord, the difference that is between the Baſſa of the Sea, and his ſonne, whoſe ſenſe I will not deliver, for fear I ſhould be ſuſpected to interpret it too advantagiouſly for my ſelf; wherefore it is for thy Highneſs to underſtand it from his own mouth, and abſolutely to diſpoſe of my happineſs, or of my unhappineſs, of my life, or of my death. <hi>Alibech</hi> having given over ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a confuſed noiſe was heard, which ſeemed to judge the matter for her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but <hi>Soliman,</hi> deſiring to render equall Juſtice, commanded the Baſſa of the Sea to ſpeak his intentions. I have no other, my Lord, ſaid he, than to chace from my houſe a woman, that ought to be driven from all the earth, and whoſe diſpoſition is ſo baſe and unjuſt, that ſhe could love a captive, when ſhe knew him not for that which he was, and betray her father; a woman deſcended from a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nouriſhed amidſt blood and cruelty, brought up amongſt wicked villaines whom the earth cannot bear, and the daughter of a Perſian thy Highneſs enemy: Behold what this woman is whom my ſonne will mary, and for all her eſtate brings nothing with her but infamy; he will tell me, it may be, that he owes his liberty to her, and I will anſwer him, that it is a good which ſhe hath not done him, but to doe it for her ſelf; ſhe knew he was the ſonne of a Baſſa, that he had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60144:12"/> Palaces, that he was rich, and that he was honored with thy Highneſs favors; ſhe betrayed her father to poſſeſs them, and hath not ſo much followed my ſonne, as ſhe hath ſought after his good fortune; and then who knowes whether her hatred to <hi>Arſalon</hi> is not rather the cauſe of her flight, than her love to <hi>Oſman?</hi> She was weary of living in a continuall priſon, and to ſpeak truly of things, ſhe owes her liberty rather to <hi>Oſman,</hi> than my ſonne doth ow his to her, ſince that at length a ranſom might have redeemed him, whereas nothing could have drawn her out of her fathers hands. What aſſurance can one place in a perſon, that gives no markes of her affection but treaſons; that ſtifles all the motions of nature, to follow thoſe wherewith ſhe is inſpired by a diſordinate love; and that begins her mariage vvith an impiety? Believe me, <hi>Oſman,</hi> ſaid the Baſſa beholding him, ſhe that hath been ſo audacious, as to betray her father for to follovv a Slave, may yet more eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray an husband for a man of free condition; ſhe that could ſo cunningly ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay the keyes of a ſleeping father, may peradventure, being become the more daring by the happy ſucceſs of her former deſignes, ſtab a dagger into the heart of an husband, when as ſhe ſhall be as weary of him, as ſhe vvas of her father. And then, my Lord, ſaid he, turning himſelf to <hi>Soliman,</hi> who knows whether all that ſhe hath ſaid be not a trick, and that being the daughter of a <hi>Perſian,</hi> ſhe comes not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſerve what is done here, and ſeek occaſion to hurt us? Howſoever it be, I find that ſhe ought to be ſuſpected of us, and that in this incounter my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt is the ſame with the publique. As for the freedom of the Slave, whom thy Highneſs hath been pleaſed to pardon, I have no more to ſay, for to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that I am not obliged to render it unto him, than that he is the cauſe of all the pain I am in, ſeeing that he alone, as this woman her ſelf ſaies, made <hi>Oſman</hi> the ſlave of <hi>Arſalon;</hi> let my ſonne keep his word with him, if he can, but as for me, I have promiſed him nothing; I will retain him in irons, not only as a Chriſtian, not only as a Captive, but alſo as an enemy. Behold, my Lord, what my ſenſe is in this occaſion, which, as I think, is not far from reaſon. <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeeing that the Baſſa of the ſea had done ſpeaking, told <hi>Oſman</hi> that he was to declare his mind. I am very ſorry, replyed he, that I muſt be conſtrained to contradict a man to whom I ow my life, and to have that croſs conformity with the vertuous <hi>Alibech,</hi> as to have a father as inexorable as hers is cruel; but, my Lord, ſince the prime duty ought to prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all others, and that reaſon will have me ſpeak without fear in this occaſion, I will beſeech thine Highneſs to conſider, whether I can without ingratitude, and without being the baſeſt of all men, abandon a perſon, who hath abandoned all for me, and that, as one may ſay, hath made her ſelf a ſlave to deliver me, ſince that remitting her ſelf to my conduct, and relying on my word, it was no longer in her power to alter her mind, but was neceſſarily to follow my will. Can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that even at this preſent I ſhould be loden with Irons, expoſed to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Pirates, and the cruelty of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> if this woman had not broken my chains, and not have for her all the affection, and all the acknowledgment whereof I am capable? As ſoon as I was a captive, ſhe began to do me good; I was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe had a care of me, with her charitable offices ſhe healed the wounds which her father had given me; I no ſooner ſaw her, but I knew her vertue; ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the afflicted, took care to relieve them; and to ſay all in a word, ſhe bewayled the Victories of her father, becauſe ſhe beleeved them not to be juſt. I confeſs ingenuouſly, that the beauty of her mind moved me more, than that of her face; and finding my ſelf ſurpriſed by the luſtre of ſo great a vertue, I enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my ſelf in ſuch ſort unto her, as nothing can be able to change it: But if ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be the foundation of the love I bear her, that which ſhe bears me hath had no leſs noble a cauſe: She ſaw me conſtant enough in my misfortune, ſhe ſaw me wounded, a captive, and ready to be ſold into a ſtrange Country, and knew, though ſhe ſeemed to be ignorant of it, that I loved her much; the gorgiouſneſs of my clothes did not win her; for they were all torn in the heat of the fight; I was wan and disfigured; ſhe ſaw me abandoned of my father, of whom I had no news; ill-entreated by <hi>Arſalon,</hi> becauſe he had loſt the hope of my ranſom; and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60144:13"/> in a more deplorable eſtate than ever man was ſeen: Love then did not enter into her heart by voluptuouſneſs, but I can ſay it was introduced thereinto by goodneſs, acknowledgement, and compaſſion; for if ſhe had not been pittifull, ſhe had not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me when I was ill, ſhe had not loved me; if ſhe had not been acknowledging, ſhe had deſpiſed the love of a ſlave, that had not the liberty to do her any ſervice; and if her heart had not been tender, ſhe had not been moved with my misfortunes, nor given an end to them. It is true, that ſhe is the daughter of the Pirate <hi>Arſalon;</hi> that ſhe hath quitted her father to follow me; that ſhe hath been brought up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt cruell and bloody men; and that ſhe is the daughter, not only of a Pirate, but of a <hi>Perſian.</hi> But, my Lord, all this, which ſeems to make againſt me, makes for me in this occaſion: for what greater mark can one deſire of a ſolid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable vertue, than to ſee a woman of eighteen years of age, whoſe inclinations are not corrupted amidſt ſo many vices, and whoſe innocencie is preſerved ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, as ſhe could not ſo much as excuſe cruelty in her father? It is true, that ſhe hath followed me, but it was to ſee no more murthers, nor fights, and becauſe ſhe ſaw a juſter temper in my mind: She hath not betrayed her father to follow a ſlave, but ſhe hath quitted the Pirate <hi>Arſalon</hi> to deliver a husband; for having promiſed to be ſo unto her, nothing but death alone can keep me from it. Moreover, my Lord, ſhe is not to be ſuſpected of thy Highneſs, for though ſhe be the daughter of a <hi>Perſian,</hi> it is of a <hi>Perſian</hi> the enemy of <hi>Tachmas,</hi> who hath for theſe eighteen years waged War againſt him. I will not ſtand to ſay, that this woman, albeit the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Pirate, is for all that of a noble extraction, becauſe the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> make Nobility perſonall, and beleeve that it ought not to paſs unto children; but I vvill only ſay, that in the eſtate wherein my fathers fortune now is, all that can be deſired in a woman is contracted in this ſame; ſhe is fair, ſhe loves me, and ſhe is vertuous. It is true, that ſhe is without wealth, and without parents, but ſhe hath loſt them for the love of me; and whereas by thy bounty my father hath no need, either of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or of riches, what can I wiſh for more in a Wife? If I take one that is rich, it may be ſhe will abandon me if I ſhould happen to fall into miſery, but this that I have choſen wil be the companion of all my misfortunes, without any fear that ever ſhe will quit me. I know that I ow a great deal of reſpect to my father, but I know that I ow my life and my liberty to this woman; I muſt then love both the one and the other, or keep my word which I have given her; for if my father will not ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded, we will go voluntarily into baniſhment; we are already accuſtomed to misfortune, and the miſery that we ſhall endure toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will no doubt be more ſupportable to us, than greatneſs and riches would be if we were ſeparated. As for the generous Slave, to whom I have promiſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I know not by what reaſon my father can pretend any right to deprive him of it; he is neither his ſlave nor mine; and by the ſevereſt law of War he can lay no claim at all unto him: He is a Chriſtian I acknowledge, but all the Chriſtians here in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> wear not fetters; he is a captive, but that is to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> and not to him; and a captive too, who after a breach of promiſe might with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice break his chains; nor hath he ſought for liberty but to give it me, and that is it peradventure that hath made my father his enemy. It is true alſo that he took me, but it was in a juſt fight; by that reaſon I am his ſlave, rather than he is mine. Let thy Highneſs ſo order it, if it be poſſible, that I may acquit me as I ought. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the crimes, my Lord, that I have committed; my father would have me perfidious and ingratefull, and I had rather my father ſhould hate me with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, than love me unjuſtly. The generous <hi>Alibech</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Oſman</hi> had made an end of ſpeaking, and having obſerved by the Baſſa of the ſeas countenance, that the diſcourſe had rather incenſed, than perſwaded him, turned her ſelf to <hi>Oſman,</hi> with tears in her eyes, and conjured him to obey his father; I will not, ſayd ſhe unto him, have you faulty for the love of me; and ſince our affection cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, extinguiſh it in your heart, and leave me the care of conſerving it in mine; remember that you are the ſonne of the Baſſa of the ſea, and that you are not yet my husband; you cannot diſpenſe with your ſelf for that firſt duty, and fortune doth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60144:13"/> diſpenſe with you for the other; I hold you acquitted of the promiſe which you cannot perform to me without a crime, and I deſire nothing of you but a will to obey your father; when I ſhall ſee you reſolved ſo to do, I will get me away alone. Alaſs! ſaid <hi>Oſman,</hi> interrupting her, in what part of the World couldſt thou find a place of refuge? All the Elements are contrary to us; the ſea hath no ſecurity for us, nor is the land more favourable unto us; thy father and mine do baniſh us from them both, and nothing but death alone can finiſh our miſeries. <hi>Soliman</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched with the pitty of ſuch tender apprehenſions, would not leave them long in pain; and though the Baſſa of the ſea would have replyed, he forbad him to withſtand his pleaſure; but whereas he knew, that the true reaſon wherefore he oppoſed the paſſion of his ſonne, was avarice, ſo ordinary amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> he told him, after he had conſulted with <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that the vertue of <hi>Alibech</hi> had charmed him in ſuch ſort, as he would adopt her for his daughter, and how in that quality he would give her three hundred thouſand Sultannies in mariage with her, commanding him to receive her for the wife of his ſonne, and to intreat her as if ſhe were his daughter, aſſuring him that he would hold the place of father unto her, and that he would intereſs himſelf in all that regarded her. That for the Slave whom he had already pardoned, it was his pleaſure, that he ſhould remit him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to diſpoſe of him as he would. The Baſſa of the ſea, who indeed had found no other defect in the vertuous <hi>Alibech,</hi> than poverty, ſeeing her to be rich by the bounty of the Sultan, changed his choler into giving of thanks, and aſſured <hi>Soliman</hi> that he ſhould be obeyed. <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech</hi> rendred him ſuch acknowledgement as was anſwerable to the favour they had received, and went away with as much ſatisfaction, as they had had ſorrow: But it was <hi>Solimans</hi> pleaſure, that <hi>Alibech</hi> ſhould firſt go and kiſs the Robe of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> who was ſtill at the ſtanding, where ſhe had ſeen the Triumph. In the mean time, the day being near to an end, the magnificences of this Triumph ended alſo by a volley of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot diſcharged by the Janizaries, which was anſwered by all the great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſeven Towers, and that of all the Gallies. Great <hi>Soliman</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the Seraglio, with the Sultana Queen, attended upon by all the Troups, which afterwards conducted the Grand Viſier to his, he that by his valour and prudence had been the only cauſe of <hi>Solimans</hi> Triumph.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Brahim</hi> Baſſa, being unable to vanquiſh the ſecret melancholy which he carried in his breaſt, could not amidſt all his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all the honours he had received, keep it from being as viſible in his eyes, as it was ſenſible to his heart. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts which he had made of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the Battails which he had won againſt the Rebels of <hi>Aſia,</hi> had indeed filled the whole extent of the Empire of the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> with gladneſs: but this generall rejoycing made not his particular; neither were utility and glory conſiderations ſtrong enough to give unto his mind only that firſt motion which precedeth joy. He was not ignorant, that fortune had not abaſed him, but to raiſe him infinitely; howbeit he knew likewiſe, that ſhe had given him that which he deſired not at all, and that ſhe had taken from him the only thing which made up all his deſires, and all his ambition; he perfectly knew, that the more happy he was for another, the more infortunate he was for himſelf; and a news which he had heard the day before from <hi>Arſalons</hi> ſlave, had ſtirred up ſo great a trouble in his mind, and agitated it with ſo much violence, as forgetting all things to abandon himſelf to grief, he remembred not that he was obliged to be preſent at the riſing of great <hi>Soliman,</hi> of whom he was beloved with ſo much tenderneſs, as he alone had permiſſion to enter into the Seraglio as often as he pleaſed, a favour ſo extraordinary, that it had never been granted to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He had alſo made choice of our Illuſtrious Baſſa to be not only his Grand Viſier, but to repoſe himſelf upon him for all the affairs of the Empire. It was he that commanded the Armies; it was he that made the Sangiacs, and gave them the Government of Provinces; it was he that preſided in the Counſell of State, and that alone formed the reſolution thereof in the Sultans Cabinet: <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was ſo powerfull, that he wanted nothing but the ſole name of Emperor, to be the chief of all the Orient. In the mean time theſe favours of fortune could not keep him from holding himſelf the wretchedeſt of all men; it was in this irkſom thought that the Aga of the Janizaries found him, when as he came to tell him, that the Grand Signior complained of his ſloth, and that it was his pleaſure he ſhould come away unto him. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſurpriſed with this commandment, which made him ſee the fault he had committed, did what he could to conceal his grief from the Aga; howbeit he perceived that there was ſome unquietneſs in his mind; <hi>Ibrahim</hi> told him notwithſtanding that he would go ſtraightway and juſtifie himſelf to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that if he durſt he would rejoyce for having committed this offence, ſince
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60144:14"/> thereby he received ſo notable a favor. After this complement he went to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, where at firſt when the Sultan ſaw him, he obſerved ſome extraordinary matter in his face; and whereas the Baſſa had paſt the night without ſleeping, his countenance ſeemed to him to be changed, he appeared to him very melancholick, and his humour being more unquiet than uſuall, he preſſed him to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the cauſe thereof; but perceiving that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> anſwered not preciſely, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him whether he had any ill news to tell him? Whether the Provinces which he had conquered were revolted? Whether the forces which he had left in the Frontiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> were defeated? Or whether he had diſcovered any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the State, or againſt his Perſon? To all theſe things the grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier anſwered from point to point; that thanks be to Heaven, he had nothing to tell him that could be diſpleaſing unto him; that the Provinces which his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had conquered were peaceable; that his Camp had nothing to fear, it being unlikely that the relicks of two Battells, which the Enemies had loſt, ſhould be of ſo ſufficient power, as to dare to preſent themſelves before an Army victorious, as his was; that for the Conſpiracies whereof he ſpake, he beſought his Highneſs to believe that his Empire was ſo well ſetled, as there was no force able to ſhake ſo great a Body; that for that which regarded his perſon, his Government was ſo juſt, as all ſtrange people beheld it with envy, and all his Subjects with joy. The Baſſa had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but the Sultan ſaid unto him very obligingly, Why then, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſince thy melancholy proceeds not from any thing that regards me, it muſt needs be ſomething that concerns thee in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and as I am no leſs ſenſible on that ſide, than on the other, I will know abſolutely of thee, what it is that troubles thy minde; for though thou haſt laboured to put on a joyfull countenance in anſwering me, yet haſt thou not for all that deſtroyed the opinion which I have conceived. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſeeing himſelf ſo neerly preſt, could not forbear bluſhing, and thinking on vvhat he vvas to ſay, he caſt dovvn his eyes, and ſeemed to be ſtrucken dumb, vvhich the Sultan having obſerved, imbraced him, and ſaid, No, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> do not ſeek to diſguiſe the truth unto me, I vvill knovv it of vvhat importance ſoever it may be: Look not on me in this confidence, as on thy Soveraign, but as on <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that is to ſay, as on a man that vvill partake vvith thee in all the good, and in all the evill that can arrive unto thee; thy courage hath made thee ſhed blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in my ſervice to oblige me to pay it vvith ſome tears, if it be ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring other remedy to thy grief. The Grand Viſier caſting himſelf at the Sultans feet, rendred him thanks for all the bounty he had ſhevved him; and vvhereas he had leiſure during <hi>Solimans</hi> diſcourſe, to invent a pretext for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, he beſought him to pardon him, if in obeying his Highneſs he ſhould ſay ſomething, that vvould claſh in ſome ſort with the reſpect which he owed him. After that the Sultan had made him to riſe, and had ſworn to him, that he would not be offended with any diſcourſe he ſhould uſe to him, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> began to ſpeak in this manner; I know well, my Lord, that my melancholy is criminall; that the cauſe of it is unjuſt; and that thy Highneſs cannot know it without condemning me; but ſince thy Majeſty hath commanded me to diſcover it, I muſt confeſs that I never turn mine eyes to behold the baſeneſs from whence thy Almighty hand hath drawn me, but I tremble with amazement; the place where thou haſt ſet me is ſo high, as it is not altogether without reaſon that I fear to be precipitated from it; and I find my ſelf in the view of ſo many people, as I hold it almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that the malice or envy of ſome ſhould make me loſe that which thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone haſt given me; nevertheleſs I am not ignorant that the ſame hand, which hath lifted me up, can ſuſtain me; but, my Lord, if the reſpect which I ow to thy High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would permit me to repreſent unto thee the moſt remarkable changes which have hapned in this Empire, thou wouldſt acknowledge, that having received far more than I have merited, I have reaſon to apprehend that that may be one day taken from me by juſtice, which thou haſt given me by bounty. The pitifull adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Achmat</hi> under <hi>Bajazet</hi> the ſecond, hath furniſhed matter for all thoſe that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60144:15"/> have ſucceeded in his dignitie, never to think themſelves ſecure: He had confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Throne of <hi>Bajazet;</hi> he had been the only man that mounted him into it; in the mean time for a recompence of all his ſervices he was ſtrangled by two Slaves. But, my Lord, not to go ſo far to ſeek for examples, that of <hi>Chaſſan</hi> Baſſa, Viſier under the reign of an Emperor, who could not be but great, ſeeing he hath given birth to thy Majeſty, is not he able to ſtrike fear into the firmeſt and moſt innocent ſoul? ſince for giving good counſell, which had not been ſucceſsful if it had been followed, he loſt that life which he had ſo many times hazarded for the ſafety of this Empire: I ſhould not have been ſo bold, as to have ſpoken of this adventure in this occurrence, had I not remembred, that I have heard thy High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bemoan the misfortune of that great man: Now therefore demand no longer of me the cauſe of my grief, ſeeing thy Majeſty knows it as well as my ſelf; but if it be true that I am beloved of thee, as I cannot doubt of it without a crime, pardon only my weakneſs, and believe not that the diſcourſe which I have made is an effect of my ambition. I know too well, my Lord, that I cannot go higher, and for that reaſon it is that I fear the inconſtancy of fortune, who being unable to raiſe me more, ſhall be conſtrained to deſtroy me for to follow her naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is an order which ſhe hath kept in all ages, and I dare not hope that ſhe will break it in favor of me. But, my Lord, were I aſſured that ſhe would be contented with bereaving me of all the honors, which I have received from thy Greatneſs, and that ſhe would leave me heavy laden with chains, as I was when it pleaſed thy Highneſs to free me of them, provided (I ſay) that ſhe would not deprive me of thy Grace, I ſhould be untroubled, and live more happily being thy Slave, than now I do being full of glory and favors. The Sultan having hearkened to this diſcourſe with a great deal of patience, could not at length forbear interrupting him; I thought, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſaid he, that I had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my heart ſo well unto thee, and ſo thorowly ſhewed thee my Love, as there reſted nothing more for thee, either to fear, or to deſire; but ſince I am deceived in my conjectures, I will pardon thy weakneſs, and if it be poſſible I wil cure thee of it. I could, if I would, find ſome excuſe for the violences which my predeceſſors have uſed during their reignes, and tel thee, that in an Empire which was not as then well ſetled, it was in ſome ſort convenient to lean rather towards rigor, than towards clemencie; but I will not undertake to make their apologie ſerve my turn againſt thee; that which was juſt in their times, would not be reaſonable in theſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will imploy other remedies, which, if I be not deceived, will make thee know, that <hi>Sliman</hi> can tell how to chain up fortune when he pleaſeth, and that he is reſolved, to meaſure thine with his life. The Baſſa would have anſwered to ſo obliging a ſpeech, but the Sultan ſtaying him ſaid; I think, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> thou haſt not forgotten, that it is by the meanes of the Sultana, my daughter <hi>Aſteria,</hi> that I have the commodity to ſee thee in my ſervice.

That being, ſaid <hi>Soliman,</hi> thou needeſt not doubt, that the deſign which I have, ſhould not pleaſe her; ſeeing that in a time, when as ſhe knew thee not but by thy good aſpect, ſhe judged thee worthy of her care; but to clear my thoughts unto thee, and to diſſipate the fear that maſters thee, know, that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to place thee in our illuſtrious alliance, by making thee mary <hi>Aſteria;</hi> and to leave thee yet a more precious gage, receive the word which now I give thee, (thou knowſt, being what I am, that it is inviolable and ſacred) remember then, that I ſwear to thee by <hi>ALLA,</hi> that as long as <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhall be living, thou ſhalt not die a violent death; judge now whether I can doe more, and whether thou haſt not been too blame to doubt of the firmneſs of my affection. It is true, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that I am the moſt ingratefull, and the moſt faulty of all men; but, my Lord,—and as he would have proceeded, he was ſuffocated in ſuch ſort with grief, as it was impoſſible for him to ſpeak in a long time, The Sultan, ſurpriſed with this unexpected emotion, knew not whereunto to attribute the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60144:15"/> cauſe of it. In the mean while <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> being ſomewhat come to himſelf again, reſolved no longer to conceal the truth of his Hiſtory; caſting himſelf then once again at the feet of great <hi>Soliman:</hi> I know well, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, that if thy Highneſs be juſt, thou wilt hate me as much as thou haſt loved me; for after I have been ſo daring, as to diſguiſe my thoughts unto thee; after I have been yet more in now telling thee that I am not in a condition to accept of the honor which thou preſenteſt unto me, I dare not hope for ſo much patience from thy moderation, as to hear that, which might render me excuſable. It ſeemes to me, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> anſvvered the Sulttn, that after all the graces vvhich I have conferred on thee, thou oughteſt to expect any thing from me, and yet to add one more to that which thou haſt craved of me, I promiſe thee to ſuſpend my judgement, and not to think any thing to thy diſadvantage, till I am forced therunto by thine own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; prepare thy ſelf then no longer to conceal any thing from me, that concernes thee: Thou knowſt that I have divers times endeavoured to oblige thee, punctually to recount unto me, both thy birth, and thy adventures; but having alwaies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how that diſcourſe did not pleaſe thee, I have had ſo much goodneſs, as to ſpeak to thee no further of it; but now that there is queſtion of thy reſt, and my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, thou muſt make a recitall to me of it with as much truth, as thou haſt uſed diſſimulation heretofore. It is true, my Lord, replyed <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that all that I have told thee hitherto is but a fable; but it is true alſo, that all that which thy High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is now to underſtand is the very truth: I cannot chuſe but bluſh to think, how I am going to diſcover all my weakneſſes; and if I did not know, that Love doth oftentimes become the tyrant of the greateſt ſpirits, and that thy Highneſs hath not been alwaies inſenſible of that paſſion, I ſhould not be ſo inconſiderate, as to acquaint thee with my miſeries. The Sultan, deſiring that none ſhould come to interrupt this narration, went from his chamber into his Cabinet, where ſiting down on Cuſhions of cloth of Gold, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> began to ſpeak in theſe tearmes.</p>

                  <p>THe City, where I took beginning, and that gives name to our Republique, is ſituated on the bank of the Sea, which the antient Romanes called <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtique,</hi> and is at this day termed the River of <hi>Genoua;</hi> this goodly City, I ſay, whereunto for the magnificence of Palaces of marble, Jaſper, and Porphirie, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that with reaſon, the title of Superb by all the people of <hi>Italy,</hi> is built on the bending of certain high and barren Mountains, which are ſo unfruitful, as all the induſtry of agriculture, joyned to the heat of the Sun, the ſerenity of the air, and the ſweetneſs of the dew, cannot make one tree to grow, one flower to ſpring, or ſo much as one herb to come up there. But if as nature had taken pleaſure to ſhew contraries oppoſed, there is leading toward <hi>France</hi> a Coaſt, all alongſt the which, <hi>Final, Savonna,</hi> Saint <hi>Reme,</hi> and <hi>Monaco,</hi> are ſeen, whoſe ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is ſo great, that it produceth abundantly Dates, Oranges, Pomegranads, Iaſemine, and Mirtle. The many Rivers, and Fountaines, which are there, make not the leſt beauty of thoſe places, for thoſe waters are ſo pure and quick, as they furniſh ſufficient coolneſs to temper the extreme heat of the Sun. It is on that Coaſt, about tvvo miles from <hi>Genoua,</hi> in going out of a Gate called the <hi>Lanterna,</hi> that a Borough ſtands, by the Italians named <hi>Arena,</hi> where one may ſay that winter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes, ſince it is certain, that the ſpring, and Autum, reign there alwaies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the firſt cauſing flowers continually to ſpring, and the other fruites to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in it: But before I ingage my ſelf to a more particular deſcription of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of a place, that hath been the occaſion of ſo much misfortune unto me, it vvill not be from the purpoſe to make an abridgment of the Government of <hi>Genoua,</hi> to thy Highneſs, to the end thou maiſt the more eaſily comprehend what the perſons are, of vvhom I am to ſpeak in my Hiſtory. It is to be knovvn then, that about two hundred yeares ſince the <hi>Genoneſes</hi> elected a Duke, according to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60144:16"/> the manner of the Venetians, who after he had conquered the Iſland of <hi>Ciprus,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the King and Queen thereof priſoners, and performed many other brave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, died at length in the warres. After him they elected two more, whereof the firſt acquired by his valor the Iſle of <hi>Meteline</hi> to the <hi>Genoueſes;</hi> but at length after the death of the laſt they put themſelves into the protection of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeaventh King of <hi>France,</hi> of whom being weary, they not long after choſe the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> for their Defendor, who having not given them full ſatisfaction, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to chuſe a Duke once again; but that proceeding being not equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto all, becauſe ſome held the party of <hi>France,</hi> and others that of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> it hapned that this diſorder returned them abſolutly under the Dominion of the French, which commanded them, untill the time that <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> who is of one of the moſt illuſtrious races of <hi>Genoua,</hi> put our City into the eſtate which now it is, namely under the Government of the Nobility. I have made known unto thy Highneſs the divers mutations which have befallen our Republique, to the end thou maiſt with the leſs difficulty comprehend that, which hath made all this Commonalty be divived a long while ſince into two principall factions; the Heades of theſe two parties are the <hi>Fregozes,</hi> and the <hi>Adornes,</hi> ingaged, as well as all the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> in two oppoſite factions, ſo known and famous under the name of the <hi>Gnelphes,</hi> and <hi>Gibelius,</hi> with whom the <hi>Fieſques,</hi> the <hi>Doriaes,</hi> the <hi>Spinolaes,</hi> the <hi>Grimaldies,</hi> the <hi>Juſtinianoes,</hi> and all the other illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Genoua</hi> have taken part. But to come to that which regards me directly, I will not fear to tell thy Highneſs what my birth is, being confident of thy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity: Thou maiſt be pleaſed to underſtand then, that I am of the illuſtrious race of that infortunate prince, from whom the valor and fortune of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond, thy great Grandfather, took his Empire, and his life, and who interred himſelf with all his glory, and with all that of the <hi>Paleologues</hi> under the ruines of this famous City of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> Thou art not ignorant, my Lord, that after ſo great a ſubverſion of that State, and in ſo generall a deſtruction, all that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Princes of the Imperiall Houſe were diſperſed over all the earth, and not able to conceal their unhappineſs in generall, ſome of them concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by changing a too famous name for their preſent fortune; <hi>Juſtiniano Paleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> of whom I deſcended, was of that number; for ſeeing he had ſaved out of that ſhipwrack wealth enough for a particular, but not enough for a Prince of ſo illuſtrious a blood as his, he retired to <hi>Genoua,</hi> retaining but the name of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> which ſince hath been the ſurname of our Houſe, the very ſame with that of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Family, which was before in the ſame City: And that poor Prince deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to accommodate his quality to his misfortune, ſhut up that ſecret within his Family, and in this ſort, though we be in effect Princes, yet have we paſt ever ſince for Gentlemen. That which obliged him to chuſe <hi>Genoua</hi> for his retreat, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other place of <hi>Italy,</hi> was, for that he knew how the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> had alwaies been well affected to that Empire; how they had mightily ſuccoured <hi>Michaelo Paleologue;</hi> and hovv in caſe it ſhould happen that he ſhould be knovvn for that vvhich he vvas, he ſhould be in a place of ſafety: And truly he had ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear it, for he had rendred himſelf ſo remarkable by the gallant actions vvhich he had performed, and had ſo ſignalized himſelf on the day of the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as he vvas the laſt that vvas ſeen to defend the breach; but at length beholding the City taken, the Emperor <hi>Conſtantino Paleologue</hi> dead, and the whole Empire ſubverted, he ſtole away his perſon from the victory of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and being retired almoſt alone he took the reſolution which I have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I know very well, my Lord, that it is too much temeritie, in the eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in things are, for me to let thee underſtand, that I am of a blood, which gives me ſome right to pretend to the Empire that thou poſſeſſeſt at this preſent; but, my Lord, I am to tell thee, that in the diſpoſition wherein I am for thy Highneſs, I would prefer my former chaines before the Empire of my Anceſtors; and that if I were the diſtributer of Crownes, I would ſet them all upon thy head, reſerving nothing for my ſelf, but the onely glory to obey thee. <hi>Soliman,</hi> not able to indure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60144:16"/> that a diſcourſe ſo generous ſhould continue longer without an anſwer, took <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> hand, and wringing it with a great deal of affection; I have alwaies indeed believed, ſaid he unto him, that thy birth was as high as thy mind, and I am glad that I have not been deceived in my conjecture; and without knowing the right which thou couldſt pretend to this Empire, I have at leaſt rendred thee all the juſtice that I could render thee; for I proteſt unto thee by all that is moſt holy, and moſt ſacred unto me, that if the conveniency of things would permit me to yield thee up the title, as wel as I have given thee the power of it, I would do it with joy, out of the knowledge which I have of thy vertues, and out of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I bear thee. But continue, I pray thee, the relation of thy adventures unto me. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> would fain have anſwered to theſe civilities of <hi>Soliman,</hi> but being kept from doing ſo by him, he proceeded in this manner. That laſt of the <hi>Paleologues,</hi> and that firſt of the <hi>Juſtinianoes,</hi> had a ſonne, called <hi>Philippo,</hi> who retaining ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his birth, had an imperious ſpirit, that would give place to no man; this <hi>Philippo Juſtiniano,</hi> my great great Grandfather, finding himſelf alwaies oppoſed to one <hi>Aſtolpho Grimaldi;</hi> the one having ever followed the party of the <hi>Fregozes,</hi> and the other that of the <hi>Adornes;</hi> it was his hap alſo to be a pretendant to the Charge of the Generaliſſimo, as well as he, ſo that their ſecret intentions breaking forth in this occaſion, they fell to quarrelling ſo outragiouſly, that they ingaged all their kindred, and all their friends in their intereſts; and as their ambition was extreme, ſo alſo was their violence: But without amuſing my ſelf in recounting this troubleſome Hiſtory to thy Highneſs, it ſhall ſuffiſe me to ſay, that following the deteſtable cuſtom, which is obſerved over all <hi>Italy,</hi> that particular and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall hatred paſſed even to my father, who yet could never approve of that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in his heart, that will have one receive with his life, the hatred of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors enemies, which being juſt for them, becomes unjuſt in their children, ſince it is addreſſed to innocency; but at length to follow the cuſtom, rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Behold, my Lord, the order wherein I found things at my comming into the World; but without ſpeaking of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to thy Greatneſs, I will only ſay, that as ſoon as I had attained the age, wherein ſtrength began to permit me to travell, I obtained of my father the means to content the extreme deſire I alwaies had of going to admire the pompous ruins of the antient <hi>Rome,</hi> and the grandeurs of the new; away I went then with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage anſwerable to my condition; but my curioſity not being limited by the view of one only City, I reſolved to give no obedience to the commandment which I had received to return unto <hi>Genoua</hi> with in ſix moneths after my departure; and as if fortune had taken pleaſure to favour my deſign and inclination, ſhe wrought ſo, that the Emperor of the Chriſtians came to <hi>Lucca,</hi> where I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for to ſee the interview of the Pope, and that Prince, I underſtood that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was making for the War of <hi>Algier;</hi> I will not fear, my Lord, to confeſs unto thy Highneſs how joyfull I was to meet with an occaſion, whereby I might learn a trade, which I was reſolved to exerciſe all my life; I will therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge freely, knowing thy generoſity, that he, who would now ſpend all his blood for thy ſervice, was thine enemy in that action. This reſolution taken, I had not much ado to execute it; for whereas <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> Prince of <hi>Melphi,</hi> was powerfull with the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> he did me the honour to make me known unto him, and promiſed me to write unto my father, for to get him to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with my deſign; the care that he took thereof was not in vain, for as ſoon as he was advertiſed of it, being good and generous, he furniſhed me with means to perform that voyage with magnificence. I will not tell thee the lamentable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of that War, becauſe the tempeſt which ſhipwrackt our Army, was not of ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60144:17"/> ſmall importance, but that it may be imprinted in thy memory; the loſs of tvvo hundred veſſels, and above fifteen thouſand men, that were all ſwallowed up of the waves, or daſhed in peeces againſt the Rocks, was ſo dreadfull an adventure, as the only remembrance of it ſtrikes horror into me: At length, my Lord, I eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that danger, after I had an hundred times ſeen death, for which I have been very ſorry I know not how often ſince; but whereas we had ſcarce any leaſure to have other enemies to fight with than the winds and the ſeas, I could not reſolve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Genoua</hi> before I had found ſome opportunity, that might make me known, whether I was worthy to carry the name of the <hi>Juſtinianoes;</hi> ſo that the relicts of our Army parting from <hi>Bugia,</hi> where they had ſought for a ſhelter, I would not follow them that were diſcharged; contrarily I imbarqued my ſelf with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Chriſtians, who took the way of <hi>Majorica,</hi> and from thence went and landed at <hi>Carthagena.</hi> But hardly was he arrived there, when as he ſaw himſelf conſtrained wholly to quit all his deſigns of <hi>Africa</hi> for to think of defending himſelf from the <hi>French.</hi> It would be unjuſt to abuſe thy patience with the recitall of a War which no way ſervs to my diſcourſe, it wil ſuffice then that I ſay, how I followed him three whole years together, except when he was at <hi>Genoua,</hi> whither I would not go for fear of being retained by my parents. But at laſt, after I had been a witneſs of all the brave actions which he performed in <hi>Navarre,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Luxemburg</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and in <hi>Guelderland,</hi> I received expreſs order from my father to come home to him, vvhich I preſently did, though the Emperor was loth to let me go. But, my Lord, what cauſe of misfortune hath that return been unto me? Ah! how much better had it been for me that I had dyed in the Wars, than to have gone to a place where ſo many grievous adventures were to befall me? It was not, for that I was not received with joy, careſſed by my kindred, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by my friends with all kindneſs, and if I dare ſay it, regarded by the enemies of our houſe with more eſteem, than that inveterate hatred, which had been long between us, would permit; but contrariwiſe it ſeemed, that the Fates had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to let me taſt all the content of a quiet and delicious life, for to make me feel at once, both the privation of the good, and alſo the evill which was prepared for me. After I had then beſtowed ſome time in receiving the careſſes of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and that I had anſwered all the queſtions which my father made me touching the War, and my Voyages; after, I ſay, I had recounted unto him an hundred times over all the occaſions wherein I had been preſent, I deſired to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that War and Gallantry were not incompatible, and that after having been three years in ſlaughter and blood, I was not returned from thence, nor more wild, or more uncivill; I took care then to inform my ſelf from my friends, whether there were not ſome Aſſembly ſhortly to be, where I might make compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen the Beauties of our Ladies, and thoſe which I had ſeen in <hi>Spain?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they anſwered me, that I might in a little time content my curioſity, for that in three or four dayes the Nuptials of two perſons of quality in our City would be ſolemnized. I further demanded of them whether a Niepce of <hi>Andrea Doriaes</hi> held not ſtill the Empire of beauty? Or whether ſince my departure ſome other had not bereaved her of that advantage, which had been given her with ſo much juſtice? They told me, that ſhe was fair, as I had ſeen her, but as for the prime place, ſhe had been conſtrained to yeeld it up to a ſpringing beauty, which made all that came near it to dy for love; and that they accounted me moſt happy for not being expoſed to that danger. But when as I demanded of them by what falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they conjectured that I was inſenſible of love? they anſwered me then, that <hi>Iſabella Grimaldi,</hi> the only daughter of <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> was that ſame admirable perſon, who could not be ſufficiently praiſed, and of whom they had ſpoken unto me; and that knowing the terms wherein we ſtood, they beleeved that I was ſo generous, as I would not ſuffer my ſelf to be vanquiſhed by mine enemy. This diſcourſe ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up ſuch an emotion within me, as hath made me to underſtand ſince, that there is a ſupreme power which forceth us, whether we will or no, and without the aid of our knowledge, oftentimes to love a perſon whom common reaſon forbids us
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60144:17"/> to regard. And conſider, my Lord, the extravagancy of my adventure, I took a reſolution then carefully to ſeek out all occaſions to ſee the incomparable <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and to ſhew that there was already ſomething extraordinary in this motion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed my curioſity, and my deſign from my friends, and I made a ſecret and a myſterie of a matter, wherein according to all likelyhood there would never be any; and indeed ſoon after I quitted them, and without further delay I went and paſſed two or three times before the windows of mine enemy. It was not becauſe I knew not well enough that I ſhould not ſee her; for it is the cuſtom of <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that all the windows of the Ladies have an iron-grate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which permits them to ſee, but ſuffers them not to be ſeen, unleſs they will dravv up the grate, which is a grace they ſeldom ſhevv, and vvas not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of me; howſoever I went thither, becauſe I could do no othervviſe. The next morning I failed not to be more diligent than I vvas vvont, and I did all that poſſibly I could to incounter her, for knowing her mother, I was certain that I ſhould have no need to ask her name; but whether it were, that whilſt I vvas in one place, ſhe vvas in another, or that fortune would defer my captivity, I could not meet with her any vvhere, hovv carefull ſoever I vvas to do it. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of my reaſon an hundred times over, vvhat aim I had in this deſign; but after I had reflected on this unquietneſs, I condemned my ſelf, and reſolved pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to attend the hap of incountring her, vvho vvas to content my curioſity. I paſt ſome dayes then after this manner in all the entertainments of a man of my age and quality; the converſation of my friends, vvalks, and muſick were my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, and the laſt quiet pleaſures that I have taſted in my life. But, my Lord, ſince I muſt recount my undoing to thy Greatneſs, and let thee ſee the field of my defeat. I muſt ſay then, that <hi>Arena,</hi> whereof I have already ſpoken, is a Burrough vvhere all the perſons of eminent condition have houſes of pleaſure, the leaſt whereof may ſtrike admiration into them that underſtand gallant things; for all that is beautifull in Architecture, all that is excellent in Painting, and all that is marvailous in Sculpture, are there to be ſeen in ſuch perfection, as neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60144:18"/> that the ſeventh repetition vvhich the Eccho made, was diſtinguiſhed perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Scarcely was this diſcourſe ended, but that devancing all the company I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred alone into the Cabinet, reſolving to try the Eccho firſt of all; howbeit, my Lord, I had no ſooner opened the windovv, but inſteed of obliging the Eccho to anſwer me, I my ſelf loſt the uſe of my voice, by the rapture vvherewithall I was ſeized, in beholding the faireſt creature that ever Nature made; ſhe vvas leaning on a Baluſtrade of Jaſper and Porphirie, which formed a Quadrant, in the midſt whereof ſtood a Fountain, wherein four Nymphs of white Marble ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to play together in bathing themſelves; for by a marvellous artifice there part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their hands in different actions, an abundance of water, which wetted them, and made one believe that they caſt it upon one another, making withall a very pleaſing noiſe. If I had never ſeen this Fountain but in this incounter, I ſhould not have heeded it ſo much, as to be able to deſcribe it; for I vvas ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with the charms of this unknovvn fair one, as I had no eyes but for her: I changed colour twenty times in a moment, and hiding my ſelf for fear of being perceived, I conſidered her with all the attention that a man could have, who from admiration was already paſſed even to love; it being moſt certain, that from the very firſt inſtant I ſavv her, I felt my ſelf forced with ſo much violence to love her, as I then fully reſolved to dye, or to poſſeſs her. As I was in this eſtate all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arrived, and ſhewed me that they were ſorry I had quitted them ſo ſoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there had been a diſpute about the nature of the Eccho, which would have pleaſed me very much; after I had heard this diſcourſe, vvithout anſwering unto it, I asked whether there were any that could tell me the name of that fair one, who ſate muſing on the brim of the fountain, which I ſaw in the midſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; in ſaying ſo, I ſoftly opened the window, which I had half ſhut, and praying them to make no noiſe, I ſhewed them that prodigy of beauty: I had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but by an hidden knowledge, which prevented their anſwer, I felt ſomething within me, that told me how it was the divine <hi>Iſabella;</hi> ſcarcely had this thought excited ſome trouble in my mind, when as one of my friends confirmed this truth unto me, and demanded of me, if it was poſſible that I ſhould not know mine enemy? Why, ſaid I, interrupting him, is ſhe that I ſee, the daughter of <hi>Rhodolpho?</hi> I ſpake this ſo loud, that I made her turn her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place where we were, ſo that having perceived us ſhe pulled down her veil, and began to go away unto two women that were walkieg in an Alley a good way off. To tell, my Lord, what became of me in this occaſion, would be a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter; my reaſon proved ſo weak, and my paſſion ſo ſtrong, as little wanted, but that forgetting all kind of good manners, I had at the very inſtant departed from a place that had been ſo fatall unto me, as to let me ſee in one onely perſon the object of my hate, and of my love: But at length, the ſpight and the ſhame of being ſeen with ſo much weakneſs, made me reſolve to try to conreal it; I ſaid then to him that had ſpoken to me, that I was raviſhed with having ſo fair an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and that though ſhe had arms which would eaſily render her victorious of all them that ſhe would ſubject, yet was I generous enough, for to combat a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by whom one might be vanquiſhed without ſhame. After this they amuſed themſelves in ſeeking out the beauties of the Eccho; thoſe of the company who had the worſt and the hoarſeſt voyces, forbore not forcing this Eccho to reproach them with their defect, in imitating them: As for me, who had it not unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at that time, it was impoſſible for me to ſing, and howſoever I conſtrained my ſelf, I could not call to mind ſo much as one air, albeit I knew many. This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment laſted ſo long, that at length, the hour of our departure being arrived, I returned to <hi>Genoua,</hi> but ſo ſad and melancholick, that to conceal my unquietneſs from my Father, I reſolved not to ſee him all that evening: I retired then to my chamber as ſoon as I was come home, and gave my people order to ſay, that finding my ſelf ſomewhat ill I was gone to bed, having firſt expreſly charged them to make no noiſe: After this I went into my Cabinet, vvhere I vvas no ſooner alone, but the pourtrait of <hi>Iſabella</hi> preſented it ſelf again before mine eyes; my imagination

Shall I chooſe for the object of my affection, her, who ought to be the object of my hatred?

This reaſoning ſeemed ſo juſt unto me, that I ſpent the reſt of the night in thinking on the means to execute it; but the more I conſidered this enterprize, the more I judged it impoſſible; the arrogant humour of <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> and the generoſity of my father, ſeemed two obſtacles very difficult to be forced; but that which put me into further deſpair, was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After that this dumb admiration had continued a while, there was a confuſed noiſe heard of acclamations and praiſes, which were given to her beauty; and the truth is, that envy it ſelf could not find any thing in her to be amended. She hath a ſtature ſo advantagious, and a port ſo majeſticall, as never was there woman ſeen of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſence. Her hair is of colour brown, but ſo beautifull, as all thoſe threads of burniſhed gold, wherewith our Poets uſe to deſcribe ſuch, cannot repreſent them; they fell that day careleſly upon her cheeks, and thence deſcended in thick curls down her neck and boſom, but with a negligence ſo repleniſhed with addreſs, that it defaced the handſomeſt curioſity of all the women of the Aſſembly. She hath a complexion ſo white and vive, as there is no whiteneſs that ſeems not ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low unto it; but the ſame is mingled with ſo dainty a Carnation, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Her eyes are black, but ſo full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ſweetneſs, as it is impoſſible to behold her, and not be taken with them;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60144:19"/> yet are her looks ſo modeſt, and ſo far from all artifice, as it is very eaſie to know that they are innocent of all the evills which they make one endure. She hath a mouth neither too great nor too little, but ſo compoſed, and of ſo Vermilion a hew, as there is no corrall that comes neer it. Her teeth are ſo evenly ſet, and ſo white, as never were ſmiles ſo full of charms as hers; and her boſom ſo delicate and ſo comely, as imagination cannot repreſent it to it ſelf ſuch as it is: There is alſo a gracefulneſs mingled amongſt all theſe marvells, which cannot be expreſt, and which renders her more amiable than all that which I have delivered. To conclude, be it for the whole form of the face, or for all the features of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or for the air in generall, it is the moſt perfect beauty that ever Nature produced. But, my Lord, had the ſouldiers that took me, left me the picture which I had of her, and the Letters which ſhe had written to me, I could have made thy Highneſs ſee the truth of my words, and that the graces of her mind do no whit give place to thoſe of her beauty: It was then, my Lord, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> with all thoſe allurements, appeared in that Aſſembly. She was apparelled in a Gown of Carnation Sattin, imbroidered with gold and pearls, whereof the ſleeves were buttoned up with great Diamonds; the reſt of her habit was of cloth of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, imbroidered with Pearls and Emeraulds intermixt. She appeared ſo charming unto me in this eſtate, as I could not for all that evening take mine eyes from off her; and as I carefully obſerved her, me thought ſhe perceived that I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her as an enemie, and to render my joy yet more accompliſhed, I marked how ſhe bluſhed every time that we met together in the ſame Brawl, but in a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which perſwaded me, that it was neither for hate, nor for anger. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is the cuſtom of <hi>Genoua</hi> not to converſe with the women of an Aſſembly, but in leading them to dance, I took out one of my kinſwomen, whom I had ſeen all the evening with <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and that I might oblige her to ſpeak to me of her, I ſaid unto her, that I found it very ſtrange ſhe ſhould hold ſuch intelligence with mine enemy; but without giving me leave to finiſh my ſpeech, ſhe anſwered me that the talk they had together was ſo advantagious for me, as I had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it; and that as the praiſes which are given us by our enemies, are more glorious for us, than others, becauſe they cannot be ſuſpected of flattery, I was no longer to doubt of my good me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This diſcourſe raviſhed me in ſuch ſort, as I could not forbear looking on <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as if I would thank her for ſo favourable a judgement; and as ſhe hath a quick and piercing wit, ſhe knew both by my demeanor and joy, that my kinſwoman had given me an account of their talk, which poſſeſt her with ſo much confuſion, as it was impoſſible for me all the reſt of the evening to incounter her eyes. At length, my Lord, the company being ſeparated, I returned home, but ſo full of joy and hope, that my reaſon found not it ſelf any longer ſtrong enough to oppoſe my paſſion. But not to ſtand on the recitall of theſe firſt proceedings of my affection, wherewith I have already but too much importuned thy Highneſs, it will ſuffice to let thee underſtand, that in the continuance of this happineſs I ſaw <hi>Iſabella</hi> in two or three Aſſemblies more, from whence I alwayes went ſtill better ſatisfied; and after I had been ſo hardy, as to write divers times unto her, and ready enough to finde the means to do it, I knew at length that my vows were not rejected, and that my temeritie ſhould not be puniſhed. I obtained then the permiſſion to ſerve her, provided I were diſcreet, and that neither by my actions, nor by my diſcourſe, I ſhould give any cauſe of ſuſpecting our intelligence: I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this order ſo religiouſly, that albeit there paſſed not a day wherein I ſaw her not at her window, or an evening wherein I had not a Letter from her, or ſhe from me, yet was no body ever aware of our commerce. And to render my good fortune more accompliſhed, it hapned that the people being fallen into a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie in the Iſle of <hi>Corſica</hi> for ſome Contribution that ſhould have been eſtabliſhed here, the Signioria deputed <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> for to go and appeaſe that diſorder; but whereas his wife, named <hi>Julia,</hi> had been extreme ſick, he would have her for the

I wrote inſtantly unto her then to propound her my deſign, but with tearms ſo full of love, and with ſuch ſtrong reaſons for the prevention of all might happen to us thereby, as at length ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto it, though, as ſhe told me afterwards, it was not without much repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.

He was ſo ſurprized with this diſcourſe, that he ſtood a good while beholding me without making any anſvver; but to keep him from indeavouring to oppoſe my paſſion, I intreated him to give no ear to any reaſon that could ſpeak to him againſt me, but to hearken to my requeſt; and ſeeing that it vvas by his means that I vvas undone, he vvas obliged to have pity of the evill vvhich he had cauſed; I likevviſe recounted unto him all that had befallen me, ſo that judging by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence vvherevvith I ſpake to him, that I vvas too far ingaged in this deſign to be diverted from it, he promiſed to yeeld a blind obedience to all that I vvould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of him. In this ſort vve parted, and albeit <hi>Iſabella</hi> had not permitted me to make uſe of the Cabinet, but only to give her Letters, to receive hers, and to ſpeak to her at ſuch times as vve could not be heard, yet I purpoſed not to reſt there, and vvithout advertiſing her of it, I cauſed a ladder of ſilk to be made, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I might deſcend into the garden vvhen I thought fit, being out of hope of ever meeting vvith a more favourable occaſion to talk vvith her of my love. But not to loſe time, as ſoon as I knevv that <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> vvas departed, and that <hi>Iſabella</hi> vvas at <hi>Arena</hi> vvith her mother, I reſolved to go thither the ſame evening; novv to do that ſecretly, I told my Father, that having made a match with <hi>Caeſar Doria,</hi> (for ſo was that friend of mine called) we intended to go and paſs away ſome time at an houſe which he had neer to <hi>Gani,</hi> to hunt the wild Bore, and to injoy all the delights that the fields and ſolitude could give us.

She prayed me with a trembling voice to give her a Letter if I had any, and that the next day, if I would let her down a ſtring, ſhe would faſten her anſwer to it. After I had laboured to aſſure her as much as poſſibly I could, ſhe made me to underſtand, that we could not have any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in that ſame place without being diſcovered, becauſe if we ſpake ſoftly it would be unprofitable unto us, not being able to hear one another; and if we raiſed our voices, it were to be feared that we ſhould be over-heard from a cloſe ally that was not far off. I conſented then to be contented with ſeeing her, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her Letters by the vvay ſhe had propounded unto me; but whereas I had my deſign concealed, I beſought her to tell me in what part her lodging was, to the end I might at leaſtwiſe have the pleaſure to imagine to my ſelf the place where ſhe would be writing. But before ſhe anſwered me, ſhe looked round about, to obſerve whether ſhe might not be over-heard; after which ſhe demanded of me, if I did not ſee on my left-hand a Turret athwart the trees, which was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end of a Gallery, that made up one front of the Garden, and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to another altogether like unto it? and having told her that I ſaw it, ſhe added that her chamber was of an even floor with that ſame place; and that the perron of it was juſt againſt the end of the cloſe alley, from whence ſhe feared to be over-heard; and that if I would advance forth my head a little, I might ſee the grate of her vvindow. As ſoon as ſhe had ſaid this, ſhe went away, having firſt aſſured me, that ſuch evenings as ſhe could not come her ſelf to receive my Letters, ſhe would ſend a mayd to me that lay in her chamber, in vvhom ſhe abſolutely confided. After ſhe was retired, and clean out of ſight, I vvent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and found out my friend, to whom I gave an account of our conference. But, my Lord, ſeeing I muſt obey thy Greatneſs, in recounting all my adventures unto thee, I muſt ſay, that after I had been three or four dayes obedient to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabellaes</hi> pleaſure, one evening ſhe ſent me that mayd which ſhe made uſe of, with a Letter, deſiring me to excuſe her if ſhe came not her ſelf; for that being ſomewhat ill in the morning, ſhe could not invent a pretext to obtain permiſſion to come into the Garden according to her cuſtom. This news grieved me exceedingly, and ſo throughly confirmed me in my deſign, that to execute it, I enquired whether <hi>Iſabella</hi> were retired to her chamber? The mayd told me, that ſhe had left her at her windovv, ſtaying till ſhe returned, which ſhe was inſtantly to do, becauſe the doors would ſuddenly be ſhut, for the keys were to be carried to her mother, who had commanded that to be exactly obſerved.

It were better, ſaid I unto her, puſhing the caſement that was not ſhut, that you would grant me the honor to entertain you a vvhile. She vvas ſo ſurpriſed with ſeeing me in that place, as ſhe could not forbear ſcreek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, whereupon ſhe would have paſſed into her chamber, but not able to op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n the door thereof ſo quickly, I had leaſure to tell her, that if ſhe put me into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, I was apt enough to kill my ſelf before her window: She fell down then upon the cuſhions not able to ſpeak, which gave me time to crave pardon of her for my boldneſs; I beſought her to remember the diſcretion I had alvvays uſed ſince the day ſhe had permitted me to ſerve her; that this was the onely diſorder whereunto my paſſion had carried me; and that if ſhe would take the pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, ſhe would not judge this fault irremiſſible. Do you believe then, ſaid ſhe, in approaching to the window, that to put my glory and your life in hazard is a crime of ſmall importance? But at length, after I had made her to comprehend, that there was leſs danger in ſpeaking with her, when all the World vvas retired, than at ſuch time as ſhe of her goodneſs had granted me, I got her to conſent, that from thence forward I ſhould alwaies ſee her in that ſort. Our conference was ſo long, as the awaking of the birds made me know, that it was time to let her go to ſleep; but before I left her ſhe gave me her picture, which ſhe had drawn in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tature, by beholding her ſelf in a glaſs; for this divine perſon is skilfull in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Arts and Sciences: She alſo permitted me to kiſs her through the grate, a favour which I may well ſay, was the onely privacy that ever ſhe accorded me du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the nights vvhich I have paſt in entertaining of her. I vvithdrew then by the ſame way I came, but ſo ſatisfied with the wit of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that I began to love her more for her vertue, than for her beauty. I found my friend in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme impatience for my return, and ready to come and ſeek me out for to know whether any misfortune had befallen me; but to recompence him for this pain, I recounted unto him all that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had the moſt obligingly ſaid unto me; the vovvs ſhe had made to love me everlaſtingly, and abſolutely to renounce the world rather than be any others than mine; and that whereas I would have perſwaded her to ſuffer her ſelf to be carried away for the avoyding of our fathers tyranny, who would be forced to agree together rather than loſe us, ſhe had withſtood it with ſo much prudence and ſweetneſs, as I was conſtrained to confeſs, how ſtrong ſoever my paſſion was, I could not merit <hi>Iſabella.</hi> It was in this manner then, my Lord, that I paſt away that lucky abſence of <hi>Rhodolpho;</hi> but at length his return changed the order of things, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> went back to <hi>Genoua</hi> with her mother, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60144:21"/> as I was afflicted; we had been ſo accuſtomed to ſee and ſpeak to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that the privation thereof was inſupportable to us; and although I went every morning to receive a Letter at her vvindow, and to give her one of mine; yet could we not comfort our ſelves againſt the conſtraint wherin vve lived. And as if it were not enough that we vvere perſecuted by our own misfortune, <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſaw her ſelf alſo troubled for a miſhap of her fathers, who in executing the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he had to go into <hi>Corſica,</hi> had procured unto himſelf the enmity of the family of the <hi>Spinolaes,</hi> by ſaying at his return, that the Governor, vvho vvas of that houſe, had contributed in ſome ſort to the mutiny of the people, and that if he vvould he might have hindred the ſedition that was raiſed there: This report obliged the Signiora to cite the Governor to come and give an account of his action, which made <hi>Iſabella</hi> to fear that this mans revenge vvould fall heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her father. As for me, who had no other intereſt than that of the incomparable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I was even mad for that I durſt not offer my ſword to <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> vvho was at that very time plotting my death; for whether it were, that he vvas adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed how I went every night about his houſe, or that he knevv of my being at <hi>Arena</hi> by ſome way unknown to me, one evening, as I was alone with my ſword under <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> Window, he came thundring upon me, with eight men armed, in ſuch fury, as I had hardly the leaſure to put my ſelf into defence; now though it was very dark, yet chanced I to know him, and thereupon reſolved, rather to be killed, than dip my hand in the blood of the father of <hi>Iſabella:</hi> I did nothing therefore but ward the blovvs which he laid at me; but tvvo of his advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards me, I had not for them the ſame reſpect that I had for him, ſo that collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my forces together to oppoſe their violence, I extended them dead at my feet; the reſt, who ſaw this ſo ſudden an execution, made a little ſtand, during the which I got me to the end of a narrow ſtreet, that was not above tvvo or three ſteps from me, for fear of being incloſed, where I fought a good while without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any more than two vvounds, which I got becauſe I would not ſtrike <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho;</hi> but at length I ſhould have fallen in this unequall combat, had it not been for a ſuccour that arrived unto me. And conſider, my Lord, the ſtrangeneſs of my adventure; that which ſhould have been the cauſe of my undoing, was the cauſe of my making: for it hapned, that at ſuch time as I was preſſed moſt by mine enemies, the ſame offended Governor, of vvhom I have already ſpoken to thy Highneſs, came, accompanyed with fifteen or ſixteen, and aſſaulted them behind. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order I never ſtood doubting which part I ſhould take, but ſiding my ſelf with <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho,</hi> I ſaid unto him, that I was come to loſe that life for him, which he would have taken from me. And whereas I fought then for <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſince it was to ſave her father, I found my forces redoubled, and my courage increaſed; whereupon being to imploy my beſt indeavour in the action, I attacqued the chief of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe with ſuch ardour, as albeit he were one of the valianteſt men of our age, yet by the good fortune of arms I ſurmounted him. As ſoon as he fell, one of his followers cried out, that his Maſter was ſlain; this voyce put all that troop into ſuch diſorder, as they thought of nothing but flying, although they were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have deſtroyed us; for whilſt I was engaged with their Chieftain, they had killed three of <hi>Rodolphoes</hi> men, who in the heat of the fight had obſerved how I had guarded him with mine own body, and that by my hand his enemy loſt his life. After I had purſued them that fled a good way off, for to keep them from making head again, I ſaw <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> come towards me with open arms, and as ſoon as he could imbrace me, he demanded of me, whether after I had been ſo generous as to ſave his life, I could be ſo likewiſe for to pardon him; and how, if that might not be, he judged himſelf unworthy to live; how he knew well enough that he had committed a barbarous and cruell fact againſt me, but how I knew alſo that he was the father of <hi>Iſabella:</hi> He ſaid this to me with ſo much reſentment and tenderneſs, as being no longer able to keep me from interrupting him, I aſſured him, that I ſhould never be mindfull of any thing hereafter but of the goodneſs which he had ſhewed me; that the grace which he did me in promiſing me his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60144:21"/> friendſhip, was far greater than the outrage I had received; and that on the contrary one might ſay, he had done an act of juſtice in going about to puniſh my temerity; and that now he did one of clemencie, in accepting of the ſervice which an enemy had rendred him. This while <hi>Rhodolphoes</hi> people would have carried away their dead men, hoping that they which were in this fight, ſhould not be diſcovered, if no mark thereof were left in the ſtreet; but <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> commanded that they ſhould not touch them, for that he was reſolved to complain the firſt; and obſerving that I did not bear up very well, he asked me whether I were hurt? I anſwered him that I thought I was, but it was ſlightly, and that when I had put him into a place of ſafety, I would go home and ſee how it was with me. No, no, my ſonne, ſaid he imbracing me, it would be unjuſt, that the father of <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould be the cauſe of your hurts, and ſhe not be your Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. In ſaying this he made me enter in at his gate, where I no ſooner was, but, the loſs of blood having extremely weakned me, I ſwooned in his armes, whereat <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> cryed out ſo loud, as I underſtood afterwards, that his wife and daughter believed his enemies were ſtill purſuing him into his houſe; they ran in then affrighted in all haſt: but whereas they knew not the particularities of that which had paſt, they were mightily aſtoniſhed to ſee me in that place, and in that eſtate. <hi>Iſabella</hi> believed at firſt, that her father, having gotten ſome notice of our love, had brought me thither to put me to death before her eyes, but ſhe was mightily ſurpriſed, when as ſhe heard him give order for the ſpeedy fetching of Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and beheld me led to his chamber, and he himſelf helping to ſuſtain me. <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſo skared with that ſhe ſaw, as if her mother had not held her up, ſhe had fallen down by me. Her father ſeeing her in that caſe, ſaid to her weeping, as I was told afterwards, you have reaſon, daughter, to love the moſt generous of men, and if I be ſo unfortunate as to be the cauſe of his loſs, I conſent that you ſhall hate me as much, as I have hated him; but without further lamenting, let us indeavor to ſuccor him. The voice of <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> having brought <hi>Iſabella</hi> to her ſelf again, ſhe would have made ſome excuſe, but enjoyning her to ſilence he commanded her to follow him to his chamber, whither I had been carried before. As ſoon as they had laid me on a bed I began to open mine eyes; and conſider, my Lord, what my apprehenſion might be, when I ſaw my ſelf between <hi>Rhodolpho, Jſabella,</hi> and <hi>Julia,</hi> who came to know, by one of thoſe that were in the action, that I had ſaved her husbands life, it was ſo great, that I thought I ſhould have ſwooned again, but the Chirurgians, being arrived, applyed remedies that kept me from it. After they had ſearched my wounds, they aſſured them that there was no other danger in me but loſs of blood, ſo that if I were ſuffered to reſt they hoped to cure me very ſpeedily. As ſoon as I was dreſt, and that <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> had been acquainted with their report, he came to me with a ſmiling countenance, and ſaid, that ſeeing he was aſſured of my life, he was not in deſpair of recompenſing me for the ſervice I had done him; that in the mean time he would go and advertiſe my father of all that had paſt, to the end that after they had imbraced one another, they might conjointly think of what they had to doe. But having told him, how I held it not fit, that he ſhould go forth, I beſought him to permit me to write two or three words to <hi>Doria</hi> for to come to me, and that when he was come we would ſend him to my father. <hi>Iſabella</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this counſell, ſo as it might not incommodate me; and having aſſured her that I found my ſelf ſtrong enough for it, ſhe gave me paper, wherein I wrote, without ſeeing that which I did, ſo weak I felt my ſelf, when I tryed to lift up my head. But <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hodolpho,</hi> deſirous exactly to obſerve what the Chirurgians had enjoined, gave order to <hi>Julia</hi> and his daughter to keep me from ſpeaking, to draw my curtaines for fear the light ſhould annoy me, to have as great care of me as of him, and not to leave me till I was in a better eſtate. I beſought him then to permit me to ſay one word more unto him; whereupon he approched to me, and preſſed me to give him ſome occaſion to ſerve me. I anſwered him, that the grace which I deſired to obtain was, that he would not ſpeak, either to <hi>Doria,</hi> or to my father, of our firſt incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but would be pleaſed to ſay onely, that good fortune had brought me by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60144:22"/> chance into the ſtreet where he was ſet upon. <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> was ſo raviſhed with this diſcourſe, as he could not forbear imbracing me, and ſaying alowd, that as the conſervation of his honor was more dear unto him, than that of his life, the care I took to deface the ſtain which he had made in it, obliged him more ſtreightly, than the blood I had ſhed to ſave his. As I would have anſwered, he ſtayed me, and went away to give order for all that he thought was neceſſary, both for his ſafety, and mine. And whereas <hi>Doria</hi> dwelt not far off, he came not long after into the chamber where I was, but ſo ſurpriſed, and ſo amazed, to hear that I was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſee me in <hi>Rhodolphoes</hi> houſe, and to find <hi>Jſabella</hi> and <hi>Julia</hi> ſiting by my beds ſide, that he was a long time in a doubt, whether he was well awake, or no. <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho,</hi> having been advertiſed that he was arrived, came and entertained him with ſo much civility, and ſpake ſo advantagiouſly of me, as I was conſtrained to pray him to change his diſcourſe, and to think rather of the neceſſity of our affaires, than of praiſing me unjuſtly. <hi>Doria</hi> was inſtructed then in the eſtate of things, and of our intentions; <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> deſired him to tell my father, that he would have gone home to him, if I had not hindred him, to crave pardon for all that had paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and to intreat him to think well of it, that his daughter might be the reward of the combat, which I had ſo happily undertaken for his defence; how he was not ignorant, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had been more equall than he, in eſteeming of me as ſoon as ſhe knew me; and that for him he was not ſo ill informed of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but that he had been advertiſed of thoſe which I had for his daughter; in the end ſo to do, ſaid he to <hi>Doria,</hi> that the Families of the <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> and the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldies</hi> may be united with an indiſſoluble knot: More than this I have not to ſay, <hi>Lodovico</hi> knowes the Nobility of my Houſe, underſtands the riches of it, and cannot doubt but that the Principality of <hi>Monaco</hi> will one day be <hi>Iſabellaes. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> promiſed to imploy all his addreſs to make the matter ſucceed according to our deſires. <hi>Rodolpho</hi> inſtantly requeſted him, I earneſtly conjured him, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> with her eys only intreated him thereunto. He went then to my Father, who was ſo ſurpriſed with every thing that <hi>Doria</hi> imparted unto him, as he divers times asked of him, whether he had not loſt his underſtanding: what, ſaid he, as I knew afterwards by <hi>Doria,</hi> in one very hour hath my ſonne ſaved the life of his enemy? hazarded his own by the wounds which he hath received? killed the enemy of <hi>Rodolpho?</hi> made peace between the <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> and the <hi>Grimaldies?</hi> and for a concluſion, hath <hi>Iſabella</hi> and the Principality of <hi>Monaco</hi> been offered him by <hi>Rhodolpho?</hi> No, no, <hi>Doria,</hi> all that you tell me is far from all likelyhood; you talk to me of blood, of murther, of ſlaughter, of reconciliation, and nuptials all at once; how doe you think that I can accord all theſe things, and can joy and grief be compatible? But in the end, my Lord, that firſt tranſport being over, <hi>Doria</hi> aſſured the matter ſo ſeriouſly unto him, as he was conſtrained to make no longer doubt of it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that in this incounter I was more happy than I hoped; for as ſoon as my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was perſwaded to this truth, <hi>Doria</hi> found his mind in the terms that I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I think, my Lord, I have already told thy Highneſs, how <hi>Lodovico</hi> never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of that unjuſt hatred, which paſſeth with the ſucceſſion of Kinſmen, and that was the reaſon why he was ſo eaſily carried to what I wiſhed. He came then accompanied with <hi>Doria</hi> and ſome of his ſervants; to the houſe of <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> who received him with a free and open countenance, and with ſuch ſtrong proteſtations of acknowledgement and amity, as it was eaſie to obſerve, that his eyes and his mouth expreſſed the meaning of his heart; and as my father would have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry, that his antient enemy ſhould have ſurpaſſed him in curteſie and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, he returned his complements with ſo much civility, as it would have been hard to imagine, that thoſe two men, who ſo kindly embraced one another, had been mortall enemies all their life-time before. <hi>Rodolpho</hi> having brought <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico</hi> to my bed-ſide, ſaid unto him, that he was much grieved to render him his ſonne in that eſtate wherein he ſaw him; but to repair that misfortune, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to accept of a preſent that he would tender him; whereupon he cauſed <hi>Iſabella</hi> to approach, and preſented her to my father, who beheld her with ſo much
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60144:22"/> admiration, as I doubted not but that he approved of the choice I had made of her; and preſently ſpeaking he aſſured <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> that though he and I had hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our lives a thouſand times over for his ſervice, yet could not all that counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the price and merit of ſo fair a maid. <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> interrupting him ſaid, that giving himſelf, together with <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and all his eſtate, yet ſhould he be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted unto me, that my modeſty forbad him to extend himſelf on the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations wherein he ſtood ingaged unto me, but how that could not hinder him from reſenting them as he ought; in the mean time he requeſted him to receive <hi>Iſabella</hi> for his daughter-in-Law, upon ſuch conditions as he pleaſed, to the end that after he had his word for it, they might think of that which was neceſſary to be done for their ſafety. My father turning himſelf then to me, ſaid, that hee held it ſuperfluous to ask my advice in a matter that vvas ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for me, and that I had ſo happily reſolved upon without him; ſo that, ſaid he, taking <hi>Iſabella</hi> by the hand, it is on you that the concluſion of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affair doth depend. But <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> ſeeing her bluſh, without daring to anſwer, told <hi>Lodovico,</hi> that his daughter could no better expreſs her conſent, than by that ſhamefaſtneſs, which made her to bluſh and be ſilent; the modeſty of her ſex, and of her diſpoſition not permitting her to teſtifie her joy, but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> and my father then promiſed an inviolable friendſhip one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ordained us to do the like in their preſence; and for a gage of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Lodovico,</hi> who ordinarily wore a rich ring on his finger, took it to me for to give to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as a pledge of the faith which we had promiſed to each other. I obſerved this ceremony with ſo much pleaſure, as ſpight of my miſerie; and hurt I never felt the like before, nor ſince; but at length, after this happy accord, they retired into another chamber to think of what they ſhould do: My Father was of the opinion, as well as <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> that he ſhould ſend to make his complaint as ſoon as the Concell ſhould be aſſembled; but that he held it not fit either for him or me to ſtay in his houſe; that the Family of the <hi>Spinolaes</hi> were powerfull enough to keep themſelves from having any manifeſt injuſtice done them; and that albeit their kinſman had been the agreſſor in that fight, yet the Laws would have the dead always to be favoured, and that he which had killed any one ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways puniſhed; that for this reaſon he was to retire to his Principality of <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> where he might attend ſafely and commodiouſly the ſucceſs of things; that place being in a ſituation ſo advantagious, and ſo well fortified, as it could keep out a Royall Army; that as for me, I ſhould finde an inviolable ſactuary in the Army of the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> whom I had already ſerved; but whereas I was not in an eſtate to travell, by reaſon of my wounds, which peradventure would keep me a long time in my bed; and for that alſo he could not go out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty preſently, becauſe the gates were ſhut, he adviſed that without further delay, and before the day appeared, I ſhould be tranſported into ſome other houſe, whereof the Maſter was ſo much reſpected, as no violence might be feared there. <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> approved of this propoſition, and began to bethink them what place would be proper for the ſame; but <hi>Lodovico</hi> told them, that he was not troubled about it, for that the Palace of <hi>Sinibaldo,</hi> Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> chief of the Family of the <hi>Fieſques,</hi> would be an aſſured retreat for them; that the high rank which thoſe of that Houſe had held in <hi>Genoua</hi> for ſo many ages, would not permit that either the inſolency of their enemies, or the rigor of juſtice, ſhould enterprize any thing upon them; that for the reſt he doubted not but that he ſhould obtain that grace of them as ſoon as he ſhould demand it; that they had alwayes favoured him in all things; and that generoſity was ſo naturall unto them, as in all times their Palaces had ſerved for a retreat to all worthy perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſons. It was then reſolved, that <hi>Lodovico</hi> ſhould go immediately and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him thereunto, <hi>Doria</hi> went alſo along with him, and they found him faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; but my Father having told his people, that he was neceſſarily to be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about an important affair, they knowing <hi>Lodovico</hi> made no difficulty to do it. As ſoon as he ſaw my Father by his bed-ſide at ſuch an hour as then it was, he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60144:23"/> doubted that ſome urgent matter had brought him thither; wherefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether he vvere ſo happy as to be able to ſerve him? Then my father recounted unto him in few vvords all that had befallen me, wherevvith he vvas ſo ſtrangely ſurpriſed; but without giving him leave to make his requeſt he to told him, that he was too blame in not cauſing him to be brought to his houſe. And when my father anſwered him, that he durſt not doe it before he had intreated him thereunto, <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> ſeemed to be offended vvith that circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſince the fault vvas done, he vvould pardon it upon condition, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might go and help to convey me thither. And ſo calling to his ſervants he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to make him ready vvith all ſpeed. My father did all that he could to ſtay him from going, but could not prevail, for <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> told him, that the <hi>Spinolaes</hi> were violent, and that peradventure meeting them in the ſtreet a ſecond misfortune might happen, that when he ſhould be preſent with all his train, he could not believe they would be ſo daring, or ſo ſtrong, as to ſet upon us. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then conſented to what he pleaſed, and he being quickly ready, they parted inſtantly to go to <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> who in the mean time had ſetled his domeſtick affaires. When <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> was arrived, and had repreſented to <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> how glad he was of our reconciliation, he prayed my father and him to arm all their people, and to give order for whatſoever was neceſſary for the tranſporting of me, during the which he approched to the bed where I lay, exceedingly afflicted to ſee them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeparate me from <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who was withdrawn to the other end of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when as <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> entred; but as ſoon as he perceived it, he told me that he would not deprive me of an happineſs, which I was ſo ſuddainly to forego, and that he ſhould have leaſure enough at home to commend my valor; that if he durſt he would have deſired <hi>Iſabella</hi> to return thither again, but that he thought it fitter to leave us at liberty together; herewith he went forth without giving me time to anſwer him; and he was no ſooner out of the chamber, but putting by the curtain I ſaw that <hi>Iſabella</hi> was alone there; for the confuſion, wherein the houſe then was, had ſo buſied <hi>Julia,</hi> as ſhe never thought of that civilitie; I beſought her then to come nearer unto me, that I might bid her adew; at that word the teares came into her eyes, and my ſpeech failed me; ſhe came then and ſate down by my bed ſide, with ſo much ſadneſs painted in her face, as much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented mine; but after I had inforced my ſelf to ſpeak, I ſaid unto her: At length, my deareſt <hi>Iſabella,</hi> fortune hath joyned us, and fortune doth ſeparate us, but what rigor ſoever ſhe doth exerciſe towards me, ſhe cannot longer keep me from dying with glory, now that I have the honor to be yours; ſhe may indeed ſeparate our perſons, and it may be for a long time, but ſhe cannot diſunite our hearts, if ſo it be true, that your affection is anſwerable to mine. You may judge, ſaid ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me, whether a maid, that hath not feared to offend her glory, in loving her enemy againſt the will of her Parents, be capable of change to a man that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his life for her ſake, and to ſave her fathers; believe then, and without ever doubting, that all the povvers of the earth, oppoſed againſt my deſign, ſhall not ſo much as make me waver; and that <hi>Jſabella</hi> will be abſolutely yours, or never vvill be any bodies. Her ſighes ſuffocated her in ſuch ſort, as it was impoſſible for her to ſay more; and as I was about to give her thanks for ſo obliging a ſpeech, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle my teares with hers, <hi>Sinibaldo, Rhodolpho, Julia, Doria,</hi> and my father came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the chamber, ſo that all I could do, was to ſay unto her, wringing her hand, that ſhe ſhould alwaies remember her promiſes, and that then ſhe ſhould be moſt aſſured, that nothing but death ſhould ſeparate us. Immediately hereupon they, which had order to carry me away, approched to my bed, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of <hi>Sinibaldo,</hi> ſeated me in a chair, that was prepared for me. <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> who moſt tenderly loved his wife, and daughter, began then to bid them farewell: <hi>Jſabella,</hi> who till that inſtant had kept her ſelf from weeping, ſeeing ſhe had a fit oportunity for it, ſhed ſo many teares, and fell a crying in that manner, as moved all the aſſembly to pitty: I knew for all that, manger my ſorrow, that I ſhared therein with her father; who, willing to ſhew ſome conſtancie in this occaſion,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60144:23"/> bad her to come unto me, and give me her hand. To tell thee, my Lord, what I felt in the moment of our ſeparation would be impoſſible for me, ſince it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that I had never ſo much grief, as I had at that time, in eloigning my ſelf from <hi>Jſabella,</hi> but in the end I was to reſolve for it; and after I had kiſſed her hand without ſpeaking to her but with my eyes, I was carryed away, ſo loſt, as I do not remember the order that we held in the ſtreetes; howbeit I was told afterwards, that <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> divided his men into two parts, and that I was placed in the midſt of them, where <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> had in charge not to abandon me, whatſoever ſhould arrive; <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> put himſelf into the head of the Troop, and my father marched in the rear, to the end that on what ſide ſoever they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, a man of command and courage might ſtill be there. But whereas the <hi>Spinolaes</hi> knew not that we were retired to <hi>Rhodolphoes</hi> houſe, they never thought of lying in wait for us, ſo that we got to <hi>Sinibaldoes</hi> without any bad incounter; After I was laid in bed, he and my father adviſed, that it would be eaſier for <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho</hi> to get away to <hi>Monaco</hi> as ſoon as it was day, than if he ſtayed longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his enemies had not had leiſure yet to think and conſider of all, that might hurt, or help them; to that purpoſe they judged it fit to diſguiſe him like a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to put him into a Feluca, which might eaſily carry him to that place of ſafety. <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> conſented to whatſoever they thought good, and <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> took upon him the care of diſpatching the buſineſs: He ſent then to the Port as ſoon as day began to appear, to hire a Feluca, upon condition it ſhould part preſently, and that the Maſter of it ſhould lend one of his habits; the money which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this man, was ſo much, as raviſhed with this incounter, and without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry, he ſaid that he was ready to part, and that for one of his habis he would lend it, ſo as he might be permitted to goe home to his houſe, becauſe he had none there. He that made the bargain agreed he ſhould do ſo, but for fear he ſhould diſcover any thing he would goe with him. The Maſter of the Feluca, who thought of nothing but his gain, was contented with it; away they went together to fetch that habit, and that done, he left that man in the guard of one of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, whom he had brought thither with him, and came and rendred an account of his voyage. Immediately <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> diſguiſed himſelf, and ſeeing it pretty far day he took his leave of <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> and my father, who both of them promiſed him to doe in his name all that they had reſolved on, and whatſoever elſe they judged would be requiſite to procure his liberty. <hi>Lodovico</hi> and he ſhewed ſo much gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity in this ſeparation, and ſpake ſo obligingly one to another, as <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> could not forbear telling them, that <hi>Spinola</hi> could not have been loſt more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably for the Common-Wealth, ſeeing his death had ſerved to make two ſo great and excellent men become friends. When they had anſwered to this civility, <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho</hi> came to me, with ſo much kindneſs, and ſuch teſtimony of acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and friendſhip, as I was ſenſibly touched therewith: He aſſured me once again with oathes, that his daughter ſhould be the reward of the blood which I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d ſhed for him, provided I did not change my reſolution. The weakneſs wherein I was, did not keep me from rendring him thanks, as I ought, for ſo obliging a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but at length he went away to find out the Maſter that waited for him: <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> did not let him go without a guard; he cauſed ſix of his ſervants to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a loof of, and he himſelf went to the Port for to ſee him part. <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> was ſo fortunate, that he croſt through the City without meeting any one that knew him; he imbarqued himſelf then with all poſſible ſpeed, and in a little time arrived ſafely at <hi>Monaco,</hi> where he was received by his ſubjects with joy. As ſoon as the Councell was ſet, they vvould have complained in <hi>Rhodolphoes</hi> name, but they found themſelves prevented by the ſpace of a quarter of an hour onely; and that the father of him vvhom I had killed, had accuſed me for the death of his ſonne: for though our fight vvas in the night, yet vvas I knovvn by my voice, and the follovvers of him that vvas ſlain had marked, hovv he and I vvere ingaged in a particular combat. This accuſation appeared at firſt ſo unlikely to the Judges, as they gave no credit at all unto it; and vvhereas they vvere not ignorant of that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60144:24"/> inveterate hatred which was between the <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> and the <hi>Grimaldies,</hi> they could not comprehend how I ſhould be induced to fight for mine enemy. As they were in this pain, my Father preſented himſelf to demand juſtice of them for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence had been done me, and to colour the matter he told them, that paſſing by chance along the ſtreet, I had ſeen <hi>Spinola</hi> ſet upon <hi>Rhodolpho</hi> with ſo much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as my generoſity not able to indure it, I preſently reſolved to labour the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of that miſchief, or if I could not, to ſide with the weaker party, as I have done; that in this occaſion I had been dangerouſly hurt; that nevertheleſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the <hi>Spinolaes,</hi> and fearing leſt the Senate ſhould be miſinformed of the truth of the matter, I had abſented my ſelf till ſuch time as juſtice was done me. My Father made this diſcourſe with ſuch earneſtneſs, and ſo advantagiouſly for <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> as it was eaſie to diſcern that he was no longer his enemy. But whereas the affair was important, in regard it concerned three of the principall Families of the City, they reſolved nothing for the preſent, but referred the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the next day, with order notwithſtanding to the <hi>Spinolaes</hi> to cauſe their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to be examined the day following. This news was inſtantly ſpread over all the City, with ſo much admiration and aſtoniſhment, as no body could believe it the firſt time they heard it; contrarily all thoſe of <hi>Genoua</hi> ſaid openly, how it could not poſſibly be, for that the hatred which paſſeth ſucceſſively into the minds of men cannot be extinguiſhed in a moment, and that by conſequence it was not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that I could paſs from one extremity to another in an inſtant, and that I ſhould render to the greateſt of mine enemies all that the deareſt of my friends could expect from me. But as nothing can be long concealed, it was quickly known, that love had begot friendſhip, and that the paſſion which I had for <hi>Iſabella,</hi> was the noble cauſe of this adventure. In the mean time the whole Common-wealth was divided; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the faction of <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> were the ſtronger and moſt conſiderable, and that it was abſolutely for us, yet could it not hinder the paſſing of an expreſs order for the ſearching out, and apprehenſion of us. And whereas the dead party is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes regarded, all the grace we could obtain was, that the affair ſhould not be precipitated, and that it ſhould be prolonged as much as the forms of Juſtice would permit. Whilſt things paſt in this manner, I wrote every day to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who anſwered me with ſo much wit and ſweetneſs, as I could not be but happy in the conſtraint wherein I lived. But at length my wounds being cured, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to remain ſhut up in a houſe at a time wherein I might make uſe of my courage, and ſhew my Judges that I was not a man to be caſt away; howbeit I felt an extreme violence for the executing of this reſolution; for though I were deprived of the ſight of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as well within <hi>Genona,</hi> as if I had been further off, yet found I for all that ſome content, in thinking that we were within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of one and the ſame City; but ſenſe was to give place unto reaſon, and I was to follow the will of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which ſerved much to make me depart the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for knowing the violence of my paſſion, ſhe imagined that being thoroughly well, I would have much adoe to keep my ſelf from ſtealing unto her ſome even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the propoſition I had made her to that purpoſe; ſo that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the miſchief that might arrive to me thereby, ſhe preſſed my departure: I propounded it to my Father, who approved of it; the difficulty was to get forth of <hi>Genona</hi> without danger; but whereas <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> never found any thing difficult to ſerve his friends, he told us, that he had an infallible means for to do it; that I ſhould but only get me in the night to his Galley, which being ready to ſet ſail, to go and joyn with the Squadron of <hi>Corſica,</hi> ſhould for my occaſion take the courſe of <hi>Seſtra,</hi> where I ſhould be received as in a place that depended on him, and from thence I might eaſily go to <hi>Ligorne</hi> in a Tartana. This order was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved, but before my departure I deſired to confer with <hi>Doria</hi> in private; I conjured him then to take a ſpeciall care to ſend me news of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as often as poſſibly he could; and that he ſhould not fail to write me punctually even the leaſt things that concerned her. <hi>Doria</hi> promiſed to ſatisfie my deſire all that he might, and to forget nothing that he thought would content me; I intreated
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60144:24"/> him alſo to go from me to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> for to give her my laſt farewell, and to receive her commands to me, foreſeeing well that <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> would make me depart as ſoon as it was night, without permitting me to go to <hi>Rhodolphoes.</hi> He ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily acquitted himſelf of his commiſſion, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had leaſure to write me a large Letter, wherein ſhe repreſented the neceſſity of my voyage ſo well unto me, and gave me ſuch aſſurances of her affection, and of her fidelity, as I depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt without grief, ſuch an abſolute power hath ſhe ever had over my mind. I took my leave then of <hi>Sinibaldo,</hi> and of my father, and followed the order they had preſcribed me; as ſoon as it was night I was conducted to the Galley in the habit of a ſimple ſouldier; and whereas the Captain was acquainted with the buſineſs, he made me enter into his Cabbin, from whence I came not forth till he had caſt Anchor at <hi>Seſtra,</hi> under pretext of taking in freſh-water. I was no ſooner aſhoar, but I went and delivered a Letter, which I had for the Governour of that place, who preſently provided me a Tartana, that carried me to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> where I was ſo fortunate as to encounter a veſſell ready to ſet ſail for <hi>Cap d' Iſtria;</hi> there I quitted the ſea to croſs through the Country of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and having put my ſelf in a fitting Equipage in a reaſonable good Town, vvhere I ſtayed certain dayes, I paſt into <hi>Germanie,</hi> where the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was then employed in the War againſt the Proteſtants. I ſpeak of all theſe things to thy Highneſs, without further clearing them unto thee, knovving well enough, contrary to the cuſtom of the <hi>Othomans,</hi> thou underſtandeſt the Univerſall Hiſtory; that there are no people ſo far diſtant, of whoſe Religion, Intereſts, Warres, and the leaſt particularities of their Countrey thou art ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; nor any Prince whoſe Exploits or Deſignes are unknown to thee. To conclude, my Lord, I can tell by long experience, that thy Greatneſs hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary lights for all that may be comprehended by a humane ſpirit; and it is out of this knowledge, that I have have not explaned my ſelf more at large in many places of my narration, which certainly are not intelligible in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thy Empire, but which cannot be ignored by the moſt knowing, the moſt mighty, and the moſt victorious Monarch of the World. <hi>Soliman,</hi> not able longer to endure theſe praiſes, given him by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſayd unto him ſmiling, that hee had not permitted him to ſpeak, but onely of his Adventures, and that to obey him exactly, he was to purſue his diſcourſe without flattering him. The Baſſa, returning no other anſwer, but a low obeyſance, continued the courſe of his Hiſtory in this ſort: I came then my Lord, to the Emperor of the Chriſtians, vvho received me, I dare ſay, with joy and kindneſs; he remembred ſtill the ſervices I had him, and in conſideration thereof vvould have given me imployment in his Army: But whereas I was uncertain of the continuance of my voyage, and was rather well aſſured, that if my buſineſs was diſpatched at <hi>Genona,</hi> I ſhould inſtantly be gone, I excuſed my ſelf the beſt I could, and went and ſerved amongſt the Voluntiers.

I received the news with ſo much anguiſh of mind, as I thought I ſhould have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief: but of all theſe things, that whereof I was moſt ſenſible, was the affliction of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which I ſaw ſo well deſcribed in a Letter that ſhe wrote me, as I forgot mine own misfortune to lament hers. I knew the ſorrow ſhe was in for her father; I knew the haughty humor of <hi>Julia;</hi> I knew that my baniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all our hopes; and even then I found her tears ſo juſt, and mine flowing in ſuch abundance, as there was no room left to obey the commandment ſhe had layd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60144:25"/> upon me to comfort her, and not to think of going to <hi>Monaco,</hi> till I heard from her; but at length, after I had a while deferred writing unto her, I ſent her word, that I would alwaies very exactly follow her directions; that I beſought her for all that to conſider, how I could not do better, ſeeing ſhe could not diſpoſe of her ſelf, than to come to <hi>Monaco,</hi> where, without fearing the violence of our enemies, we might live and reſt in ſafety; that the <hi>Spinolaes</hi> were not powerfull enough to raiſe an Army for to ſet upon us there, and that the Republique would not of a particular intereſt make a generall cauſe; that for the reſt, time, it may be, would change the order of things; that ſometimes ſentences had been revoked leſs unjuſt than that which baniſhed me, and for men that were not of the family of the <hi>Juſtinianoes,</hi> and that peradventure were not more profitable for the publique good: In the end I did all that I could to obtain permiſſion to come unto her; I wrote alſo unto <hi>Julia,</hi> with ſo much reſentment of that loſs, which was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to me, than it was grievous unto her. As for my father, I ſent him word, that I would buy out my liberty with my blood, being reſolved to perform ſuch brave things in the Wars, as my Judges, and mine enemies themſelves ſhould wiſh to ſee me again; but that for the executing of ſo noble a deſign, he was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me firſt to go and mary <hi>Iſabella</hi> at <hi>Monaco;</hi> and that if my life were dear unto him, I prayed him to ſollicite <hi>Julia,</hi> when her tears were dryed up, to accompliſh <hi>Rhodolphoes</hi> promiſe. For <hi>Doria,</hi> I conjured him again to be carefull in curiouſly informing himſelf whether <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> mind were as firm in this incounter, as ſhe had made me hope it would be; for I well foreſaw, that <hi>Julia,</hi> who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our reconciliation, had never loved me, would bring ſome obſtacle to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. After I had diſpatched away my pacquet, I remained in ſo extraordinary an unquietneſs, that I could not ſettle my mind on any object, but ſuch, as being ingenious to perſecute me, offered every minute to my thoughts the image of a nevv misfortune; but how intentive ſoever it was, I could not foreſee that which arrived unto me. As I was in this deplorable eſtate, I underſtood by a Letter from <hi>Doria,</hi> that my father being infinitely afflicted for my baniſhment, was dead of a Feaver, the very ſame day that he wrote this to me; and that to ſecure his eſtate unto me, he had paſt it over to the Count of <hi>Lauagna,</hi> who queſtionleſs would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it faithfully for me. I muſt confeſs, my Lord, that the loſs ſo ſhaked my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, as it was ready to fail, and I proved in this occaſion, that the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Nature are more powerfull than all others; and to leave no place for me to doubt of it, I had almoſt forgot <hi>Iſabella</hi> in this my firſt tranſport; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that reaſon had combated with grief, and that I was able to look upon my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper with a calmer eye, I found it yet far greater than at firſt I had believed it to be: I ſaw all at once, both the loſs of my Father, and that too of my Miſtris; no way doubting but that it would be hard for me to carry <hi>Julia</hi> to that I deſired, there being no body now that had any intereſt to make her keep her word.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60144:25"/> were on the ſea-ſhore, had ſent to demand permiſſion of the Princeſs, that he might ſtay a while in that place, for to gather together as much as he could of the remains of his veſſell, which was not ſunck, and whoſe men for the moſt part had eſcaped with ſwimming, or by the aſſiſtance of a Barque, that by chance was then near unto them. Moreover <hi>Doria</hi> advertiſed me, that <hi>Julia</hi> had received him magnificently; that not long after it was bruted in <hi>Genoua,</hi> how that Prince vvas become inamored of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and hovv the very ſame day that he wrote me this, he was told that he had put himſelf into mourning for to pleaſe the Princeſs. All this troubled me not ſo much as <hi>Doriaes</hi> concluſion, how that the Letter he had ſent me from <hi>Iſabella,</hi> had been delivered to him by an extraordinary way, and how by a note which ſhe had written unto him, ſhe ordained him to ſend her no more Letters till ſuch time as he had a new order from her. I no ſooner read this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing circumſtance, but my mind was poſſeſt with ſo much fury, as I was no longer capable of reaſon; I found my ſelf ſeized at once, with love, jealouſie, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, grief, and revenge: I would at one inſtant reproach <hi>Doria,</hi> complain of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> revenge my ſelf of the treaſon of <hi>Julia,</hi> and puniſh the comerity of my Rivall. Amidſt the divers paſſions wherewith my ſoul was agitated, I fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an hundred deſigns, whereof the execution was impoſſible; but after I had diſputed with my ſelf, I reſolved to go in perſon to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and demand a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her, why ſhe had not acquainted me with her new conqueſt; for in the end, ſaid I, I will have the ſatisfaction to adore her innocent, or to hate her guilty. But as the body and the mind are ſo ſtraitly allyed together, that the one cannot ſuffer without the other, I fell ſick the very ſame day I was to depart, and ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, as the Emperors Phyſicians, who by his order viſited me every day, were out of hope of ſaving me; and verily had I not had a ſpark of hope remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But as if the health of the body had not been beſtowed on me, but for the better ſupporting the evills of the mind, I received my deaths wound by a Letter from <hi>Doria,</hi> which gave me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had maried the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> and that to put it out of all doubt, he had learned it from <hi>Felicianaes</hi> own mouth, vvho not enduring her Miſtreſſes infidelity, without ſhewing her reſentment thereof, had been turned away out of the Princeſſes ſervice; he vvrote me alſo, that ſince the laſt Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet which he ſent me, he never had received any news from that inconſtant one; that <hi>Julia</hi> had made a journy to <hi>Genoua</hi> a little before that unlucky wedding, without her daughter in her company, where ſhe had publiſhed that that mariage ſhould ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſolemniſed; that having been advertiſed of it, he had gone to her for to demand of her, whether ſhe would diſhonor her ſelf in rendring ſo little reſpect to the aſhes of her dead husband, as to fail the promiſe which he had made me? That her daughter was no longer hers, ſeeing I had bought her with my blood, and the life of <hi>Rhodolpho;</hi> that it was a payment, and not a grace, which he required of her; and that at laſt he was reſolved to carry things to extremity rather than indure to have this injuſtice done me; that to all this ſhe had anſwered peremptorily, how her daughter ſhould never mary a man that was baniſhed from his Country, and that if I would have promiſe kept with me, I ſhould come and ſolicit the performance of it at <hi>Genoua;</hi> and that after ſhe had ſaid ſo, how ſhe had left him, and would not hear him ſpeak a word more. I leave it to thy Highneſs to imagine the deplorable eſtate, whereinto this adventure put me, it was ſo ſtrange, that all my paſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing themſelves into one, I had nothing but fury remaining; and deſpair ſo fully ſeized upon my ſoul, as I thought no longer of revenging my ſelf of <hi>Julia,</hi> nor reſenting the outrage which I had received from the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> nor of puniſhing the infidelity of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> but my deſign was wholly then to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſelf, and to exerciſe upon mine perſon all the cruelty which the crimes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had deſerved. This deadly thought was ſo deeply ſetled in my heart, as if my Religion had not with-held me, I had killed my ſelf; but at length I reſolved to go and die like a man of courage, and in a place where I ſhould never hear <hi>Iſabella</hi>

After this, my Lord, I have nothing elſe to ſay unto thy Highneſs concerning that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the reſt of my fortune, ſeeing it is the work of thy hands, and that I could not bring it again to thy remembrance without offending thy modeſty, knowing well enough by experience, that the image of thine own vertues makes thee caſt down thy lookes, and change colour: I will not tell thee then by what meanes thou haſt dravvn me out of irons for to raiſe me up to the greateſt commands of thy Empire, but I will onely ſay, that in the midſt of this pomp, and of this glory, I am in one day become the moſt wretched of men; and not to keep thy Majeſty any longer in ſuſpence, may it pleaſe thee to knovv, that the generous ſlave, to vvhom thy Highneſs hath given his life, is the ſame <hi>Doria,</hi> vvhom thou haſt heard ſo often mentioned in my adventures, that dear confident of my loves, and the moſt faithfull of my friends; <hi>Soliman,</hi> having interrupted him, demanded, whether he had not ſet him at liberty; but <hi>Ibrahim</hi> anſwered, that he alone could give it him, and that becauſe he would doe nothing of his own private authority, after he had

The triumph being finiſhed, I was no ſooner in my Palace, but I ſhut up my ſelf in my Cabinet with that dear Slave; I will not tell thee, my Lord, the taking that <hi>Doria</hi> and I were in, ſince it is a thing that may be more eaſily imagined that ſpoken: <hi>Doriaes</hi> amazement was ſo great to ſee me alive, to find me in the habit which I wear, and to obſerve me in the rank which I hold, as his reaſon above an hundred times gave his eyes the lie: As for me, I was no leſs ſurpriſed to ſee him at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and to imbrace him in the habit of a Slave, than he was to behold me with a Turbant. Our firſt motions of joy being over, I confeſs, my Lord, that my firſt thought was for <hi>Iſabella;</hi> well now, ſaid I unto him, my dear <hi>Doria,</hi> hath the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> triumphed over all my hopes, and hath he rendred himſelf poſſeſſor of an happineſs which he did not deſerve, and which I thought I had been Maſter of? I had not ſo ſoon made an end of ſpeaking, when as <hi>Doria</hi> fell to demand pardon of me, to accuſe himſelf of too much precipitation, to commend the conſtancy of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and to blame my deſpair; but becauſe this diſcourſe was obſcure, I requeſted him to clear it unto me: Whereupon he told me, that <hi>Julia</hi> was no longer amongſt the number of the living, that the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> was dead, and that <hi>Iſabella</hi> was never his wife; but to particularize this unexpected event, thou mayeſt be pleaſed to underſtand, that as ſoon as <hi>Julia</hi> perceived the Prince of <hi>Maſſerans</hi> love to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſhe reſolved, ſeeing the authority wholly in her ſelf by the death of her husband, to make that ſecret hatred ſhe had alwayes born me to flaſh out; whereunto alſo may be added, that this woman being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, it may be the Title of a Soveraign blinded her, and carried her to that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell deſign of deſtroying all our pleaſures; to attain the more eaſily thereunto, ſhe thought it would be fit utterly to break off our commerce, which was not very hard for her to do, for <hi>Monaco</hi> is ſeated on the height of a great Mountain, almoſt inacceſſible on the three ſides; the other which looks to the Sea is ſo ſteep, as one cannot behold it without horror; there reſts then but one winding way which leadeth to the Port, ſo that whereas this Town hath but one onely avenue, and hath alwayes a Garriſon in it, it was eaſie for her to keep the Princeſs from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any intelligence from me, or giving me any; without doubt it was the fear of this rigorous proceeding that obliged the Princeſs to write unto <hi>Doria</hi> to ſend her no more Letters. In the mean time <hi>Julia</hi> ſaid openly to all the world, that the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> was going to mary <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and whereas the Princeſs ſuffred her ſelf to be ſeen of no body, was aware no body was aware of the deceit; for I have been informed by <hi>Doria,</hi> that as ſoon as ſhe obſerved the paſsion which ſhe had begot in the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> and that ſhe perceived how her mother would force her to this unjuſt mariage, ſhe feigned her ſelf ſick, to the end ſhe might with the more civility decline the viſits of this new Lover, who divers times was upon the point of renouncing his pretenſions through the rigors of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but <hi>Julia</hi> aſſured him ſo effectually, that ſhe would vanquiſh her obſtinacy, provided he would be ruled by her, as he reſolved to yeeld her a blind obedience.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60144:27"/> 
                     <hi>Julia</hi> was to perſwade every one that this mariage was accompliſhed, to the end that if I were advertiſed thereof, I might be capable of ſome extreme reſolution, either upon mine own perſon, or on that of the Princes, or on hers, which I could not execute without going into a place where I ſhould loſe my head if I were found there. This deſign was ſo well carried, that all they of <hi>Monaco</hi> beleeved it themſelves, and made others to beleeve it. This univerſall error, it may be, had not for all that been faſtned on <hi>Doria,</hi> if <hi>Julia</hi> had not taken a particular care to make him beleeve what all the world beleeved; and indeed to ſpeak the truth, no body could have exempted himſelf from this impoſture: For this woman, having ſuborned <hi>Feliciana</hi> with gifts and great hopes, made a ſhew of chaſing her away with violence, and to make the matter be publiſhed the better, ſhe ſent her back to <hi>Genoua,</hi> where ſhe was no ſooner come but ſhe repaired to <hi>Doria</hi> all in tears. I think thy Highneſs remembers, that this mayd had alwayes been <hi>Jſabellaes</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, thou wilt not find it ſtrange then if <hi>Doria</hi> did not doubt of her diſcourſe, when ſhe aſſured him with a feigned ſorrow, that the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maried the Princeſs with her own conſent, and not being able to forbear telling her of the promiſes vvhich ſhee had made to mee, ſhe had been ill-intreated both by the Mother and the Daughter, vvho had driven her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way outragiouſly. It vvas by this artifice, my Lord, that <hi>Doria</hi> was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and whereas this newes troubled him, and poſſeſt him with fury, he wrote it unto me as ſoon as he heard it, as I have already declared unto thy Highneſs. But this man, whoſe high and generous ſpirit makes the intereſts of his friends more ſenſible to him than his own, underſtanding that the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> was at <hi>Genoua,</hi> reſolved to puniſh him, and revenge me; and for this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he carefully informed himſelf of the place where moſt commonly he was, but fortune, that intermeddles with all things, favoured his enterpriſe, by leting him know, that the day following he was to go and ſee the ſtately Palace of <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> his near Kinſman, and whereas it was out of the City, he judged this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity too advantagious to be neglected, imagining rightly that he would go thither with little company, ſince, as I have before delivered, he was at <hi>Genoua</hi> unknown. The matter failed not to fall out even as he had conceived it; for he was advertiſed that the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> was in this walk attended but with two of his ſervants; he went forth then ſpeedily with the like number, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking him in a place where few perſons could be witneſſes of his action. As ſoon as he was ſo near him, as he might ſpeak to him, he asked him whether he knew my name, and whether it were poſſible he ſhould be ignorant that <hi>Iſabella</hi> could not lawfully be his, becauſe ſhe was mine? but ſince the thing was done, he muſt at leaſt render himſelf worthy of ſo noble a conqueſt by the loſs of his life, as I had bought it with my blood; in ſaying ſo they both drew out their ſwords, and <hi>Doria</hi> without attending the Prince of <hi>Maſſerans</hi> anſwer, attacqued him ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goriouſly, as he was conſtrained to give ground: They that accompanied him would have oppoſed themſelves to this fury, but they that followed <hi>Doria</hi> would not ſuffer them ſo to do; and whereas they were equall in number, they began a juſt combat, whereof the modeſty of my friend kept him from telling me the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; but in the end, notwithſtanding whatſoever the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> could perform, the victory ſided with reaſon, and <hi>Doria,</hi> after the receiving of a ſlight hurt, preſſed his enemy with ſo much courage, as he ran him into the body in four ſeverall places, which made him fall down as if he were dead: A minute after, Nature doing her laſt devoir, he opened his eyes, and ſeeing <hi>Doria</hi> coming from parting their followers, and giving order to his help to carry him to ſome place, he had yet ſo much ſtrength, as to call him, and before he expired to crave pardon for the outrage he had done me, and to pray me to conſider the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> eyes for the excuſing of his fault; moreover he conjured him to tell me, that the Princeſs had kept her faith inviolable to me; then he acquainted him in few words with all the violences of her mother, with all the reſiſtances which ſhe had made thereunto, and at the laſt ſwore that he was not her husband, but that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60144:27"/> 
                     <hi>Julia</hi> had uſed this artifice, in hope to make me away, as I have already told thy Highneſs, not doubting but that if I were dead ſhe ſhould have carried her daughter to all that ſhe had deſired. Scarcely had that infortunate Prince made an end of ſpeaking, but he dyed in <hi>Doriaes</hi> armes, who with ſorrow remitted him into the hands of his ſervants, to goe and provide for his own ſafety; ſo that without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time, and before this combat was divulged, he ſent to hire a Feluca, and without returning into the City he imbarqued himſelf for <hi>Naples;</hi> for in the uncertainty of the event of the combat he had brought mony enough about him to mak his retreat into that place, and had left a letter in his Cabinet, which inſtructed one of his friends with the order hee would have taken in his affaires. He departed then ſafely away in this ſort, but the next day he incountred the Pirate <hi>Arſalon,</hi> and in the manner, which thy Highneſs underſtood yeſterday, he came to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But my Lord, to make all the rigor of my deſtiny known to thy Majeſty, I am to tell thee further, that not long ſince <hi>Doria</hi> hath met with a ſlave of <hi>Monaco,</hi> who hath related unto him, that as ſooon as <hi>Julia</hi> knew of the death of the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> anger and grief ſeized ſo upon her, as ſhe died therewith in a little time; ſo that <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſeeing ſhe was Miſtreſs of her ſelf, had ſent a man into <hi>Germany</hi> to deſire me to come and take care of her State, and to receive her perſon for a reward of my fidelity: For ſhe knew nothing, either of my jealouſie, or deſpair, which having carried me far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the place; whither ſhe had ſent to ſeek me, beguiled all her hopes, and deſtroyed her felicity, by the fruiteleſs return of him ſhe had imployed unto me; ſince that ſhe lived in a very auſtere and melancholick ſolitarineſs, ſaying openly, that ſhe was reſolved to renounce the world, as ſoon as ſhe knew, that I was no longer in it. And whereas there ran a bruit in <hi>Genoua</hi> about a year ago, that I had been ſeen in <hi>Naples,</hi> ſhe diſpatched away this man for to goe and ſee if it were ſo; having made a vow, if his voyage proved vain, to ſhut her ſelf in a Cloiſter for all the reſt of her life; but whereas fortune hath never done any but extraodinary things in my adventures, ſhe ſo wrought, that this man, putting himſelf into a French Barque to paſs over thither, was taken by a Pirate, whoſe veſſells lay under the covert of a Rock, which is near to a place by the Italians called <hi>Porto Hercoles.</hi> And whereas he had a grat number of Slaves, he ſtayed not long from going to ſell them at one of the Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> from whence by divers accidents this man came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where <hi>Doria</hi> by chance knew him, as having at other times ſeen him in <hi>Rhodolphoes</hi> ſervice. After all this, my Lord, it will not be difficult for thy Highneſs to imagine the deplorable eſtate wherein I find my ſelf by thy bounty, and by the propoſition which thou haſt made me concerning the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana <hi>Aſteria.</hi> I ſhould not be ſo hardy as to ſpeak to thee in theſe termes, if I did not call to mind, that the charmes of the divine <hi>Roxelana</hi> have been of ſufficient force to vanquiſh the moſt victorious Monarch of the world; and that for this reaſon I may hope to ſee thee ſenſible of my misfortune, to obtain pardon for my ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to be heard in my juſtifications. It is true indeed, that to excuſe my fault I need no more than to beſeech thy Highneſs to conſider, that if I could even baniſh from my heart the image of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> forget her affection, her oathes, and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie; become the moſt ingratefull of men to his Princeſs; cauſe her death by my change, which ſhe would quickly know; prefer my Maſter before my miſtreſs, and my duty before my love; the Religion I profeſs, prohibiting me the plurality of wives, which that of the Mahometans doth permit, I could not diſpoſe of a faith, which I have already given, ſeeing I am a Chriſtian under the habit of <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> although I be not believed to be ſo in all the extent of thy Empire: But whereas for all that it is not juſt that my temerity ſhould be vanquiſhed, deprive a man of thy favor, who refuſeth an alliance, which a great King outght to receive on his knees: Baniſh from thy ſight and Court a man, whom ſo many benefits, whom ſo many greatneſſes, and to ſay all, whom thy affection cannot make perfectly happy; and to ſatisfie the Sultana <hi>Auſteria,</hi> I am ready to reenter into the irons from whence ſhe drew me, and to die her Slave, ſince I cannot live her husband: Or if thy Highneſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60144:28"/> will render my end more profitable and glorious, command me to ſeek out death in the midſt of thine enemies, and I ſhall not be long without teſtifying by the loſs of my life, that I am not ingratefull, but becauſe I cannot be acknowledging. And to incenſe thy juſt wrath, I will ſay further, that the chaſtiſement, which I demand, will be inſtead of grace to me, ſince that in depriving me of light, I ſhall no longer be ſenſible of all the misfortunes wherewith I am ſo heavily oppreſſed; I ſhall ceaſe to live, but I ſhall ceaſe alſo from being rebellious to thy pleaſure; I ſhall reſtore the life which I ow to the incomparable <hi>Aſterin;</hi> and I ſhall dye for the glory of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> In brief, my Lord, ſince I cannot be <hi>Aſteriaes,</hi> becauſe my love doth oppoſe it, and my Religion doth forbid it; and ſince I cannot likewiſe live for <hi>Iſabella,</hi> becauſe my duty doth tie me to thy ſervice, both by a generall right, and by a particular obligation, death is the onely remedy that remains for me to get out of ſo many miſeries. If thy goodneſs had not broken off my fetters, and that I were ſtill thy ſlave, now when that I know that the conſtancy of <hi>Iſabella</hi> hath triumphed over the artifice of our enemies, that I reign ſtill in her heart, and that on me alone her felicity or her happineſs doth depend, I would employ all my endeavour to free me of my chains by a ranſom: But, my Lord, I am tyed to thee by ſtronger bonds; the obligations wherein I am ingaged to thy Highneſs, the benefits which I have received from thee, the honours thou haſt done me, and the laſt degree of glory whereunto I am mounted, are too certain proofs of thy love, and of thy confidence, for me not to be retained in my duty: It is then by theſe ſacred bands that I am tyed unto thee, and which I cannot break without ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. Finally, my Lord, the thoughts of liberty, which paſs for a juſt deſire in the minds of all men, were an horrid crime in me; and I may well promiſe thy High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I will never ſo much as dream of it: And as I am generous enough not to doe any thing that may blemiſh my love, ſo am I yet more not to doe any thing that may wrong my duty. There is no need then of guards to keep me from going out of thy Empire, being fully reſolved to ſacrifiſe all my pleaſures, rather than doe any thing unworthy of the name which I carry, and the choice which thy Highneſs hath made of my perſon, for to be the firſt in thy favour, as I am in thy Eſtates. But without further deferring pronounce the ſentence of death, ſo juſt, and ſo much wiſhed for. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having given over ſpeaking, <hi>Soliman</hi> roſe up, fell to walking a great pace, and with his eyes fixed on the ground continued in ſo deep a muſe, as the Baſſa doubted that he ſhould obtain the effect of his requeſt; but he was not long in this uncertainty; for the Sultan ſtanding ſtill, and beholding him in a manner that teſtified more grief than anger, and more compaſſion than wrath, ſaid unto him with all imaginable kindneſs, that he held himſelf infinitely unhappy, in that poſſeſſing ſo great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that being ſo victorious and triumphant, and that being able to give felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſo many people, yet could not render the onely man whom he could love, happy. Upon this ſo obliging a diſcourſe, <hi>Jbrahim</hi> would have fallen on his knees, but he would not ſuffer him, ſaying unto him, that he would fain have obtained ſo much reſolution of himſelf, as to part for ever from a man, who was ſo dear unto him; that he had debated the ſame in his mind, when as he walked in that manner, as he ſaw; but that at laſt the affection which he bore him had ſurmounted his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, and that it was impoſſible for him to reſolve on ſo grievous a ſeparation; that he conjured him to excuſe the effects of his friendſhip, as he excuſed thoſe of his love; and to teſtifie unto him, that as well as himſelf he did all that he could, he would permit him to goe atd ſee <hi>Jſabella,</hi> provided he would paſs his word unto him to return again within ſix monthes; with this promiſe alſo, that if during his abſence he could accuſtom himſelf to this privation, he would give him his liberty wholly and intirely.

As for the reſt, if he would permit him to go to <hi>Monaco,</hi> he would ingage his faith to render himſelf at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time that he had preſcribed; and that he was not to fear that he would break his word with his Highneſs, ſince he would keep it with his very enemies. After this aſſurance, the Sultan told him, that he did not doubt of it, but that which obliged him to require an oath of him for it, was the knowledge that he had of the force of the paſſion which reigned in his heart; and that his friendſhip would be ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this enemy of its content. <hi>Jbrahim</hi> ſwore then ſolemnly, that nothing but death alone ſhould keep him from accompliſhing his promiſe. That done, <hi>Soliman</hi> told him, that he would not have conſented to his voyage, knowing that his affairs were not compoſed at <hi>Genoua,</hi> had he not had the meanes to have the ſentence revoked, which had been given againſt him. And when as <hi>Jbrahim</hi> beſought him to to let him underſtand, how he thought to perform ſo unexpected a a thing, the Sultan told him, that to comprehend his deſign, he was but to remember, how one of his <hi>Chaoux,</hi> returning out of <hi>France,</hi> and ſtaying at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> had been murthered in the ſtreetes by a popular commotion; ſo that having been advertiſed thereof by one of them that accompanied him, who inſtantly imbarqued himſelf away, he had cauſed all the Veſſells of the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> that were found in his Ports, to be arreſted; and that for the better favouring of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, an Ambaſſador was the day before arrived from his Republique, whom he had cauſed to be put in priſon at <hi>Pera,</hi> being perſwaded that he had done nothing unworthy himſelf therein, ſince the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> had firſt violated the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the perſon of his <hi>Chaoux;</hi> how it was for to communicate this affair unto him that he had ſent for him in the morning, but the ſadneſs which he had obſerved in his countenance, had hindred him from it, and carried him into another diſcourſe.

After which he ſhut himſelf up in a lodging apart, that was a good way from his own, which was too much frequented with people, there to receive <hi>Doria</hi> at more liberty: The Palace of the Baſſa of the Sea was not far from <hi>Ibrahims,</hi> ſo that it was not long before they brought him his deareſt <hi>Doria,</hi> to whom that Baſſa in requitall of that gallantry which had been uſed towards him, had in exchange of his fetters given him a chain of Diamonds. It was in this interview, that theſe two friends felt all thoſe joyes and pleaſing raptures, which true friendſhip cauſeth in the ſoules of two perſons, who for ſo many years had been in deſpair of ever ſeeing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their hearts were at one inſtant ſo repleniſhed with pleaſure and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as not able to expreſs together their amazement and their joy, they remained a good while embracing one another, without the ability to ſpeak; but at length, <hi>Ibrahims</hi> paſſion being the ſtronger, it obliged him to open their firſt diſcourſe by <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in calling <hi>Doria</hi> his Preſerver, in giving him thanks for expoſing his life to deliver her, and revenge him; and craving pardon of him for the pains he had ſuffered in his captivity, as counting himſelf the innocent cauſe thereof. <hi>Doria</hi> anſwered to all thoſe things with as much kindneſs as could be; but whereas love is more powerfull than friendſhip, and as this paſſion reigns imperiouſly over all the reſt, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> returned ſtill to <hi>Monaco,</hi> he would have <hi>Doria</hi> particularize again that which he had already told him the day before; he demanded of him whether

Upon this diſcourſe <hi>Doria</hi> confeſſed unto him ingenuouſly, that he had been ſtrangely ſurprized vvith finding him Grand Viſier, and the Sultans Lieutenant-Generall throughout all the extent of his Empire, ſince to be that and a Chriſtian ſeemed to be tvvo things incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; but in regard of that vvhich he had told him, he vvould aftervvards forbid his reaſon to judge any more upon apparances: Hovv it vvas notvvithſtanding true, that he had believed that he vvas not abſolutely culpable, but hovv it vvas certain alſo, that being unable to conceive this adventure, he had been troubled to think in vvhat terms he ſhould dare to inform and clear himſelf therein. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he would eaſily forgive him this injury, ſeeing he himſelf could not in a manner conceive by what means, or by what wayes fortune had conducted him to the point wherein he then was: That in the mean ſpace not to loſe time, which was to be ſo precious unto him, it was fit he ſhould tell him, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had been ſo good as to permit him to go and ſee <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and that he might do it with glory and ſafety, the Sultan had found out an undoubted expedient to cauſe the Sentences which had been pronounced againſt them, to be revoked. But whereas <hi>Doria</hi> could not eaſily believe that which he heard, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> recounted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing unto him from point to point, juſt as it had been reſolved in the Sultans Cabinet; but he did not diſcover unto him, that he had ingaged his word for his return within ſix moneths, for fear he ſhould be afflicted at it; for as for his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he no way miſdoubted it. <hi>Doria</hi> finding that he purpoſed to return out of hand to <hi>Genoua,</hi> told him, that he had loſt a very affectionate friend in the perſon of <hi>Sinibaldo,</hi> who was dead of ſickneſs, as the Slave of <hi>Monaco</hi> had informed him, but that he had left a ſonne behind him, the heir of all his vertues, and one that promiſed great matters. Is he not called <hi>Giovanni Lodovico,</hi> replied <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> after he had bemoaned the death of <hi>Sinibaldo?</hi> Yes, ſaid <hi>Doria,</hi> and he was not above a dozen years old when you went away, and yet then there was great hope of him. Hereupon one brought <hi>Ibrahim</hi> word, that the Slave of <hi>Monaco</hi> was come, which made <hi>Doria</hi> repreſent unto him, that being to return to <hi>Genoua,</hi> he held it not fit that this Slave ſhould ſee him in the habit he wore, becauſe he could not poſſibly forbear publiſhing of it, which might prejudice him much, or at leaſtwiſe oblige him to make a publick manifeſtation of his adventures. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> agreed with him therein, ſo that he charged him, who brought him that meſſage, to carry this Slave to the quarter where the Officers of his houſe were lodged, which was a great way off from his own, with order to uſe him well, and not to let him go
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60144:30"/> out of his chamber without his expreſs command. That done, he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Doria,</hi> and deſired him to work in ſuch ſort, as he might have the Letter which the Princeſs had wrote to him by this man, to the end he might be aſſured of her fidelity. <hi>Doria</hi> told him that the matter vvas not very difficult, and that to oblige him to deliver it, he need but let him knovv, hovv he vvas ſtill alive; and becauſe alſo hee vvas to ſee him during their Voyage, it vvas requiſite to tell him, that hee had been a ſlave as well as they, and freed in the ſame manner, that he might not be ſurpriſed when he ſhould ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord the veſſell. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> approved of this counſell of his friend, and prayed him to go inſtantly and labour to bring him that pretious treaſure, which was able to make him happy. <hi>Doria</hi> condiſcending thereunto, the Baſſa cauſed him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by four ſlaves to the place where that of <hi>Monaco</hi> was, who a good while would not part with <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> Letter, till he ſaw <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> becauſe he could not beleeve, that a man whom he had gone to ſeek for at <hi>Naples,</hi> ſhould be at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> but <hi>Doria</hi> ſwore ſo ſeriouſly unto him, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was alive, and that he ſhould ſee him within a few daies, as at length, knowing him to be a man of great quality, and <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> friend, he ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> Letter, which he had with much ado preſerved all the time of his captivity; preſently whereupon <hi>Doria</hi> returned to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who attended him with extreme impatience; as ſoon as he perceived him, and that they which conducted him were retired, he lovingly imbraced him, and conjured him no longer to defer his happineſs, but <hi>Doria</hi> without anſwering him rendred him that precious gage of <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> fidelity, which poſſeſſed our Illuſtrious Baſſa with ſuch joy, that he could hardly obtain ſo much tranquillity from his mind, as to read this Letter: But at laſt, after he had kiſſed it with tranſports that cannot be imagined but by thoſe who know the force of this noble paſſion, which reigned in his heart, he opened it, and ſaw that it was thus.</p>

The next morning, according to the order he had received for it, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> went to the Seraglio; and whereas he had a particular permiſſion to come thither at all times, whenſoever he would, he went into the Sultans chamber, who was not ready. <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſeeing him come in, ſaid unto him, how he was glad to obſerve in his countenance that the remedy, which he had found out for his grief, was not in vain; but to make an end of healing him ſpeedily he had commanded over night that the Ambaſſador of <hi>Genoua</hi> whom he had cauſed to be made a priſoner at <hi>Pera,</hi> ſhould be brought unto him; the Sultan told him further, how he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order, that the Ambaſſador ſhould come without ceremony, becauſe if the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cuſtom had been obſerved, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> then, as the chief Baſſa, muſt have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him, which he not thinking fit, for that ſo he would have known him, he choſe rather to hold this courſe; beſides alſo that ſending to have him received at the gate of the City, and cauſing him to be preſented with an horſe, and roab of cloath of gold, according to the uſe, he ingaged himſelf conſequently to give him publique audience, which he would not doe, to the end he might ſpeak more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to him concerning the matters he deſired of him.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60144:31"/> at his departure from <hi>Pera;</hi> for it is the cuſtom of the Sultan to receive no Ambaſſadors but ſuch as have one of them on, according to the manner of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He was ſuſtained under the arms by two Capigibaſſi; the Baſſa that conducted him, marched two paces before him to preſent him to the Sultan, who received him with ſome civility: when as he had ſaluted the Grand Signior, he delivered the Letter that the Republique had written to him, which <hi>Soliman</hi> gave unto a Dragoman, who interpreted it unto him for forms ſake only, for he underſtood it better than he. No ſooner had he done hearing him, but he cauſed the ſame Interpreter to tell the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that the injury which he had received in the perſon of his <hi>Chaoux,</hi> was ſo great, that if he had followed his juſt fury, his head had anſwered for that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; how it was for that he had cauſed him to be arreſted, but that he had ſince changed his mind at the interceſſion of a Chriſtian ſlave, who had been a ſutor to him for it, and that had found grace before his Highneſs; but that for returning him back, as he was going to do, together with all the veſſels which he had cauſed to be ſtayed in his Ports, and for forgetting alſo the outrage that he had received from his Republique, they were to accord him one thing, which he deſired of them. And when as the Ambaſſador had anſwered him, that the thing ſhould be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if they did it not, he told him, how all that he would have was, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſhould revoke the Sentence which they had pronounced againſt <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and that <hi>Doria</hi> ſhould be no more troubled for the death of the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran;</hi> that it was <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> to whom <hi>Genoua</hi> owed her ſafety, and to whom he was to render thanks for his life; that he remitted both him and <hi>Doria</hi> to his conduct, for the putting of that in execution which he deſired; but that he ſhould take good heed they fayled not therein, becauſe if that ſhould happen, nothing ſhould be able to keep him from making War upon <hi>Genoua</hi> it ſelf with all the forces of his Empire. This Ambaſſador was ſo ſurpriſed with hearing the Sultan ſpeak of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Doria,</hi> as it had divers times like to have made him forget the reſpect which he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, for to interrupt him, but at length after <hi>Soliman</hi> had given over ſpeaking, he anſwered him, that the thing he deſired was ſo beneficiall to the Republique, as his Highneſs need not fear to be refuſed; that the merit of thoſe two excellent men was ſo generally known, as the Senate had not obeyed the Laws but with grief, and that doubtleſs they would be extremely joyfull of ſo juſt and ſpecious a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to infringe them. After this <hi>Soliman</hi> diſmiſſed him, and told him yet once again, how he ſhould remember, that in this occaſion they were to ſatisfie him, or to have him their enemy; howbeit he ſomewhat careſſed him in bidding him fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and excuſed the not receiving him with all requiſite Ceremonies for ſome reaſons which he might not tell him; that in the mean time he ſhould prepare himſelf for his departure, and that he ſhould have his diſpatch. When he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired according to the cuſtom, that is, without turning his back to the Sultan, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> came forth of the Cabinet, and caſt himſelf at his feet, to give him thanks for ſo many teſtimonies of the affection which he received every minute from his Highneſs. But <hi>Soliman</hi> took him up, and told him, that eight years ſervice well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that acknowledgment; that withall likewiſe in labouring for his good, he ſhould eſtabliſh his own felicity, which would never be perfected till he ſaw him contented; that the impatience he was in for his departure, was occaſioned by the deſire he had of his return, and that it might no longer be deferred, he was to go and make an end of taking order for his affairs, and that immediately after noon he ſhould come and bid him adieu, and bring <hi>Doria</hi> with him. <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> anſwered to all theſe things with as much generoſity, as kindneſs; and for a concluſion, he deeply proteſted never to think himſelf acquitted of the infinite obligations wherein he was ingaged to his Highneſs, but in ſacrifiſing his life for his ſervice. He would have proceeded further, but the Sultan interrupted him, and once more commanded him to have no other thought than of going to ſee the incomparable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and of giving life again to <hi>Soliman.</hi> After this the Grand Viſier durſt not make any reply, but retired homewards to go unto his dear <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> whom he had not ſeen ſince the evening before, and he encountred him in the

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60144:32"/> but wrought with ſo much art, that neither the <hi>Greeks</hi> nor the <hi>Romans</hi> have ever ſhewed any fairer; ſome were wreathed, ſome fluted, and others ſo artificially twined about with fillets, as they ſeemed to preſs down the foliage, wherewith it was inriched; over the Corniches and Frizes of half relieve, which were garniſhed with leaves of <hi>Acanthes,</hi> were nothing but Chaplets of Triumph, Cornucopiaes, and Trophies of Arms. Finally, the magnificence of the Palace was ſo great, that the very gates of it were of Ebony, with mouldings ſo curiouſly proportioned, as the great ſilver nails wherewith they were ſtudded all over, made the leaſt part of their beauty. <hi>Doria</hi> was not yet reſolved to quit ſo rare an object, had not the Baſſa forced him to enter, that he might obſerve the Vaulting which ſuſtained the Paviglion, whoſe key-ſtone was an Onix of a prodigious bigneſs, and whereof the Artiſt had ſo well contrived all the colours, and made ſuch uſe of them, as he had thereof formed a Coronet of flowers, ſo admirably well done, that it beguiled the ſight: The reſt of the Vaulting was all of white Marble, the better to ſet off ſo fair a work, but ſo well joyned and poliſhed, as it ſeemed to be made of one entire ſtone.

But whereas <hi>Ibrahim</hi> knew that there was ſomewhat yet more marvellous to be ſeen, he made his dear <hi>Doria</hi> to paſs along under the ſecond Paviglion, and although the vaulting of it was fairer than the other that he had already ſeen, yet did he not make any ſtay there, ſo much was he raviſhed with the magnificent Fore-front of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Palace, which wholly diſcovered it ſelf from thence; and truly I muſt confeſs, that he had reaſon ſo to be, ſince all that art and materialls can contribute to the beauty of a work, was eminently found in this ſame. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a great Building that took up the whole bredth of the Court, which was retrenched ſome thirty paces from the Houſe by a Balluſtrade of Jaſper and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirie, and raiſed on the Palace-ſide the height of four ſteps, which formed in the middle an half pace of the ſame matter. The pavement of this Court was gray and white Marble, and in the midſt of it was a Fountain, whereof the bole was of Orientall Alablaſter, tranſparant as Chriſtall, and ſix foot Diameter, born up by a pillar of divers-coloured Marble; the out-ſide of the bole was inriched with little Sea-Monſters of half relieve, admirably well done. Round about the pillar were four Harpies of Braſs, their paws reaching to the depth of the Ciſtern, and their backs turned oppoſite the one to the other to uphold the pillar; the tips of their wings extended alſo to the bottom of the Alablaſter bole, as ſeeming to bear it up; they had womens faces, but Serpents writhen talls finiſhing in antick foliage, which met together on the top of the pillar juſt againſt the Center of the bole, whereunto likewiſe it ſerved for an ornament: In the midſt of this bole was a Vaſe reverſt, made alſo of Orientall Alablaſter, which on its foot ſuſtained a round baſis, whereupon were ſet the three Graces, almoſt quite naked, made of <hi>Corinthian</hi> metall; they ſtood back to back, ejecting water out their breaſts, and each of them holding a Cornucopia, which met all together a little above their heads; out of the flowers and fruits, which were repreſented there with ſuitable pieces, made of Agates, Onixes, Turqueiſes, Carnalines, Topazes, and Emeraulds, iſſued ſix ſpouts of water, which fell down into the hole, and diſgorged themſelves into the Ciſtern through the muzzels of ſix Lions that were ſeen on the outſide thereof. As for the ſix others, which iſſued from the breaſts of the Graces, and that did not ſpin out, they fell juſt into the heads of fix Dragons of braſs, which were on the brim of the bole, and that rendred them again through their mouthes: Theſe Dragons ſeemed to ſtrive to get out of it, holding the brim with their tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, the reſt of their bodies, except their heads, and the tips of their wings, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be hidden therein; ſo that thoſe twelve ſpouts of water, comming to croſs

The reſt of the roof vvas covered in the ſame manner, as well as the Paviglions, whereof I have ſpoken; but when as <hi>Doria</hi> came to caſt his eye a little lower, and to obſerve that all the ornaments of this Fabrique were of Jaſper, Chalcedonie, Agate, and Onix, he was ſo ſurpriſed, as he could not forbear demanding, whether this which he ſaw was not inchantment: But though the abundance of Feſtons, of Trophies of Armes, Arabeſques, Vaſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Frizes, Corniches interlaced with Drapery, extinct Torches, Cornucopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aes, and Chaplets of triumph, gave him a world of admiration, yet was he far more ſurpriſed to behold four and twenty Columnes of Touch, which ſeemed to ſuſtain the firſt Order, and which were placed by two and two in equall diſtance, between each window; the baſis and capitalls of them were of white and red marble, in correſpondencie to the body of the building, which was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thereof; but to preſerve theſe Columnes, and to render them withall the more magnificent to the eye, they were twyned about with the leaves of Achanthes of braſs guilt, which yet was no hindrance, but that one might diſtinctly diſcern of what ſtone they were made, ſo as the beauty of them might be admired for their prodigious greatneſs. Over the Entrata was a ſtatue of <hi>Soliman</hi> on horſeback in baſe relieve; and on each ſide between thoſe Columnes were ſix Niches, filled with ſix great ſtatues of women, habited <hi>a L'antipue,</hi> and repreſenting the divers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſubjected to <hi>Solimon,</hi> who with one hand ſeemed to offer him their Crowns, and with the other leaned on the Scutcheons of the armes of the Kingdomes, which they repreſented. After he had well obſerved all theſe marvailes of Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> told him, that having yet many things to ſhew him, which it may be deſerved his approbation, as well as thoſe he had already viewed, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite they ſhould make a turn in the Garden, that all the outſide might be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before he let him ſee that the inſide was not ill underſtood; he made him paſs then under a great Vaulting, which traverſed the whole body of the Houſe, from whence one deſcended to the Garden by a large half pace of Porphirie. This Vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was all of Moſaique work, compoſed of different Marbles and Jaſpers, upon a ground of Alablaſter, but ſo wonderfully wrought, as an excellent Painter could not with a pencill interlace a foliage more artificially, better obſerve the lights, and the ſhadowes, nor make a fairer piece with liquid colours, which by his mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them he renders ſuch as he pleaſeth, than this excellent Artiſan of ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a work had done with ſuitable pieces, whereof the colours were all ſimple and naturall, and the joyning of them together imperceptible to he cleareſt ſighted eyes. <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> whoſe impatience was extreme, and who imagined, that every moment imployed by him any other way, than in thinking of his departure, was an outrage to his love, and a crime towards <hi>Iſabella,</hi> preſſed <hi>Doria</hi> ſo much, as he made him deſcend into the Garden; howbeit he ſtayed a little on the top of the half pace the better to conſider the beauty and extent of it. He ſaw upon the firſt ſight of it four preat parterres, in the midſt whereof was a Round of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60144:33"/> bigneſs, about the which were ſeen upon the baſes of green Jaſper fix figures of fiſher-men, as big as the life, whereof there were three that held each of them a Trident in his right hand, with the arm lifted up for to dart it; and the other three teſtified by their action the joy which they felt for having hurled theirs ſo rightly, as that they had therewith ſtruck a Sea Monſter, which was repreſented in the middle of the Round, lying half along on his ſide, his head and his tail out of the water, and with ſo much art, as he ſeemed to be ſomwhat pained with the hurts which the three Tridents had given him, and from whence iſſued three ejects of water, that were in ſtead of blood to him. Juſt oppoſite to the half-pace and the Round was a Grot, admirably fair, both for the matter whereof it was formed, and for the art wherewith it was made, ſo that <hi>Doria,</hi> being much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with this object, ſeconded the grand-Viſiers deſign, and went on as faſt as he deſired him; the Baſſa, not to loſe time, cauſed him to obſerve in going along, that on each ſide of his Garden was a cloſe arbor, erected vvith porticoes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, where the Gardiner had made it well appear, that he was not ignorant of all the beauties of Architecture, ſince it had not any ornament there, which was not of the ſame proportion, and of the ſame ſymetry, as was obſerved over all that ſtately Palace. He made him alſo caſt his eye to both the ſides of the Grot, from whence there ran a Baluſtrade of Jaſper, beyond the which was ſeen on the right hand a Laberinth, ſo artificially contrived, that it might be called a priſon without a gate; it being moſt certain, that without at the leaſt a prodigious chance, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught by him that made it, one could not get out of this <hi>Dedale,</hi> what care ſoever a man took to mark how he went into it: <hi>Doria</hi> would fain have gone and made tryall of it; hovvbeit <hi>Ibrahim</hi> would not ſuffer him, but obliged him to look toward the left ſide of the Baluſtrade, where vvas ſeen a Grove of Orange, Citron, Pomegranate, and Mirtle trees; and although the proſpect of this place was delectable, and the ſent of it odoriferous, yet <hi>Doria</hi> paſt by them to admire the mervailes of the Grot, whereunto they were then near; but whereas the deſcription of it would be too long, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that it was of an Octangular form; that although it was of a juſt depth, yet it was for all that ſo lightſom, as all which the Orient hath of moſt rare was there to be ſeen: And to conceive a light Idea of it, one muſt imagine, that he beholds together all the maſter-pieces, or to ſay better, all the miracles of Nature; one muſt then figure unto himſelf great rocks of Chriſtall, of Emeraulds, and of Rubies, where there was ſeen in ſome of them, that the Sun had not leiſure to finiſh his work, being without colour in divers parts; one muſt alſo paint forth to his imagination that wonderfull ennamell of Orientall Shells, whereof the diverſity is ſo agreeable, be it for their formes, or for their lively colours, ſo well mingled, and ſo well ſorted, that of all naturall things they are the faireſt, and moſt perfect; one muſt likewiſe conceive that in his mind, which all the Painters cannot repreſent, I mean thoſe great Conques of <hi>Nacre,</hi> where the beames of the Sun leave ſo beautifull an impreſſion of their light, as neither Opales, nor the Rain-bow have any colours that are not ſurpaſſed by the luminous Argent whereof they are formed, and which makes me name them with reaſon the favorites of the Sun. But after all theſe things one muſt imagine yet an infinite number of great branches of Corrall, of all colours which Nature hath produced, namely of all the Carnations, white, black, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of fire. There muſt be further added to all theſe mervailes the faireſt congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the rareſt petrifications, whereof Philoſophers, or Hiſtorians have ever ſpoken to us: After this, I ſay, one may conceive part of thoſe things which <hi>Doria</hi> beheld in this Grot, vvhere all the artifices of vvater vvere ſeen admirably vvell executed; there vvas a fall vvhich ran from a rock of Chriſtall, and vvhich loſt it ſelf preſently under another, whereof the noiſe vvas ſo charming, as there is not a heart ſo light, nor a humor ſo ſullen, in vvhom this murmure vvould not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a pleaſing fancie; and that there may no doubt be made of the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this inchanted Grot, I will ſay no more, but that <hi>Jbrahim</hi> himſelf, hovvſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he vvas preſſed by his paſſion, could not chuſe but be ſurpriſed by a thought
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60144:33"/> of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which gave <hi>Doria</hi> the more leaſure to ſee all that I have ſpoken of, and a thouſand other rare things, which would be too long to relate.

Having ſeen this they re-entred into the Palace, and aſcended by a great ſtair of white and red Marble, that had a rail and baliſter of the ſame; at the top they found a Lobby, whoſe ſeeling and walls were adorned with an Arabeſque of Gold and Azure, inlayed with little peeces of Chriſtall, like to Moſaique work, which yeelded both a goodly and magnificent object. From thence they went into a ſpacicus Gallery, which was on the right wing of the Palace, where <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had made a Library of all the curious Books of the Orientall Languages, and of all the choiceſt and rareſt in the Greek, Latin, Spaniſh, and Italian; but whereas the grand Viſier did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies joyn magnificence to curioſity, all his Books were bound up in plates of Gold, enammelled with white and green, and placed in order upon ſhelves of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bony, which were bordered with a dentile of Goldſmiths-work, enammeled with the ſame colours. There were alſo in this Gallery between the windows a great number of Maps, both univerſall and particular; and upon a Tablet over the Books a many of Globes and Spheres, different from one another, according to the divers opinions of all them which have treated of ſuch matters. In the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likewiſe he had placed all ſorts of Mathematicall inſtruments, the faireſt and the beſt made that ever were ſeen; as concave Mirrors, Clocks, Olomeſtres, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of proportion, and Aſtrolabes. But whereas <hi>Ibrahim</hi> contented not himſelf with neceſſary things, but would alſo have thoſe that were for delight, he had there a number of thoſe paintings, which by opticall reaſons do make ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and charming illuſions; for that purpoſe then he had Cilinders of ſeverall greatneſſes, and to refreſh the ſight of them which read, he had of thoſe Chriſtall Triangles, which by the effect of a marvailous reflection do take and give all at one time the colours of the Rainbow to all the objects that are ſeen through them. He had alſo divers magnificent Desks, Proſpective-glaſſes, and before the middle window a Table of Ebony, garniſhed with Gold, and enammeled as the ſhelves, with a Standiſh upon it covered all over with Emeraulds, ſome dark, ſome clear, which made a foliage admirably well repreſented. At the end of this Gallery that looked upon the firſt Court, was a door which opened to the Terrace, whereof I have ſpoken, and which anſwered to the Paviglion in the middle, where the Grand Viſier had made a Cabinet of Arms, which he would needs have his dear friend to ſee; he led him then by the way which I have noted, but <hi>Doria</hi> at his entrance into it was exceedingly amazed and ſurpriſed; for the very firſt object that his eye met withall, was a Trophy of Arms, ſuſtained in the air by the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vertue of a great Adamant, which was the Key-ſtone of the roof of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, wherein were ſeen together, and in order, all the different Arms, both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern, of all the Nations of the World; but ſo fair, ſo magnificent, and ſo enriched, each one according to its uſe, as one would have ſayd, that they were the Maſter-peeces of all the excellent Artiſans that ever wrought in Arms: But amongſt the reſt thoſe of <hi>Perſia</hi> were the richeſt, and moſt ſumptuous; all the Scymitars had their Hilts and Scabberds of Gold, all covered over with pretious ſtones; and whereas that Country doth abound with Turq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eyſes, there were Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets and Quivers ſet all over with them, and Bows and Arrows anſwerable to the glittering beauty thereof. Now though the ſight of all theſe things were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleaſing to <hi>Doria,</hi> yet gave he over beholding them, as ſoon as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſhewed him three Harquebuſes of a miraculous artifice; whereof the firſt, which he cauſed him to make tryall of, ſhot off without fire, by the means of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60144:34"/> wind which coming to iſſue forth expelled the bullet with the like impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; the ſecond performed the ſame thing with water; and the third, but the moſt marvellous, by the means of that powder which is called white, ſhot off, not only vvithout fire, but alſo vvithout noiſe. If <hi>Doria</hi> had follovved his humour, he would have ſtayed a long time in Philoſophying on all theſe ſecrets, by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that neither vvater nor vvind, could ever have the ſame activity vvith fire, and ſo by conſequence that vvhich he ſavv could not be vvithout inchantment; but <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> told him they vvould ſpeak of it at leiſure during the voyage they vvere going to make, and vvithout harkening to him further, he made him go forth at a door oppoſite to that vvhereby they had entred, and vvhich gave upon the ſame Terrace that anſvvered to the end of the Gallery on the left vving, vvhere the Illuſtrious Baſſa had cauſed all the Turkiſh Emperours to bee dravvn, from <hi>Othoman,</hi> vvho vvas the firſt, to <hi>Soliman</hi> then reigning. But whereas he was not contented with having their faces repreſented, but would have the <hi>Othoman</hi> Hiſtory alſo painted, there was in this Gallery fourteen great Tables, in each of which was an Emperor as big as the life, and within the ſame frame all the principall actions of his Reign; but the ſame ſo well done ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and ſo well ordered, as <hi>Doria</hi> was raviſhed therewith, and plainly ſwore to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that he would not ſtir out of that Gallery till he had conſidered all theſe Pictures attentively, and that he had expounded them unto him. The Baſſa decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it as much as he could, but at length ſeeing his friend perſiſt in his obſtinate curioſity, he reſolved to ſatisfie him, upon condition nevertheleſs, that he ſhould not ſtand to particularize all that he ſaw in thoſe Tables: And when as <hi>Doria</hi> had ſhewed him that he was contented therewith, he requeſted him to pardon him, if in the proſecution of thoſe painted Hiſtories he ſaw a number of victories gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Chriſtians, which much againſt his mind he had ſuffered to be there, but that in the end he durſt do no otherwiſe.

This battell which you ſee afar off, is that which he obtained againſt the <hi>Teggiur</hi> of the Town of <hi>Pruſia;</hi> but mark a little how the induſtrious Painter hath ſo done it, as all theſe figures ſeem to move, and that in this diſorder one may know the victorious party; he hath done it ſo too, that <hi>Othoman</hi> is eaſily diſcerned there: But if this ſight be well repreſented, this aſſault of that Town of <hi>Pruſia,</hi> and where he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eſtabliſhed the ſeat of his Empire, wil not ſeem leſs marvellous unto you. This pane of the wall, which you ſee fallen down, and which lets you perceive them plainly that defended it, is it not admirably well done? Theſe other Towns which you behold ſo diſtinctly, are thoſe of <hi>Sinopa</hi> in <hi>Galatia,</hi> of <hi>Angauri</hi> in <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> of <hi>Sebaſta</hi> in <hi>Capadocia;</hi> and theſe which you ſee further off towards thoſe Rocks, are the reſt which he gained on <hi>Mare major.</hi> As for this Land-skip, ſet thick with Towns, which you ſee beyond <hi>Pruſia,</hi> it is of <hi>Natolia,</hi> that he wholly conquered; and this Army which ſeemeth to march, and whereof all the ſouldiers are laden with booty, is the firſt that ever paſſed into Europe, and that made ſtrange havock under this excellent enemy. But without ſtaying to conſider the reſt, let us paſs on to this other Table.</p>

                  <p>THe Phyſiognimy of this Prince is not deceiving, and although it doth promiſe us much, wee ſhall yet find more: After then that this Prince had defeated <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> the laſt ſonne of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whom the Greeks had made to riſe up againſt him, as alſo another <hi>Muſtapha</hi> his brother, whom the ſame Greeks had likewiſe protected, he turned the fury of his armes againſt them; taking from them the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> which the Painter hath repreſented unto us as fair as the Hiſtorians have deſcribed it, and whereof the perſpective is ſo marvellous, as one hath much adoe to believe that the running in of this gate is not effective. But let us return to the Victories of this Prince, who ſpoiled the higher <hi>Miſia,</hi> took the Town of <hi>Senderovia,</hi> conquered the Countries of <hi>Sarmian,</hi> and of <hi>Sarcan,</hi> two mighty Princes of the leſſe <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Coni</hi> from the <hi>Caraman:</hi> The Hungarians having in the mean time broken the peace which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with him, he returned into <hi>Europe,</hi> and was ſo fortunate, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Gallies, which lay at the ſtreight of <hi>Heleſpont</hi> to hinder his paſſage, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by foul weather to retire; he in the mean while came to that memorable plain, which gave name to the famouſeſt battel that ever was heard ſpoken of. And ſee you not how the Painter hath been pleaſed to repreſent it? Mark this Squadron a little which gives ground, and this other which is broken; conſider the left wing which is routed; obſerve this cloſe Battalion, which is going to attacque this other that is ready to fly: As for the body of the Battail, where you ſee ſo great a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſuch a confuſion of dead horſes, men overthrown, blood ſpilt, and armes broken, it is here in this place, where the Painter would repreſent the death of <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> which arrived in this battel, with the loſs very near of all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Hungary;</hi> ſome fighting to revenge the death of their Prince, and others to recover his body; but to ſhew clearly that the victory was on <hi>Amuraths</hi> ſide, the Painter hath repreſented Renown, which ſeemes to fly over his Troopes for to advertiſe them of it.

He was prudent, and adviſed amidſt dangers, prompt and vigilant in his enterpriſes, indefatigable in War, of an invincible courage, a reaſonable Juſticer manger his cruelty, extremely liberall; and that which is of moſt marvail in this Prince is, that he was never vanquiſhed after he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60144:37"/> was Emperor. He loved the reading of Hiſtory, he made verſes in his own tongue, was very skilfull in Painting, and even to the point, that he ſent, as I have already delared, the Battell which he obtained againſt the Sophy, drawn with his own hand, unto the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who conſerve it ſtill unto this day in their Treaſurie. There is alſo a great number of his works to be ſeen in the Seraglio: He was very Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and nothing curious of the magnificence of Apparell; and that which I moſt admire in him, is, that he alwayes refuſed thoſe adorations which are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be rendred to the Turkiſh Emperors, never ſuffering any to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ground in ſpeaking to him, nor to do him reverence on their knees. And truly if this Emperor had not blemiſhed his glory by that prodigious deſire of reigning, which carried him to take away the life of him, from whom he had received his; to cauſe two of his Brothers, eight of his Nephews, and as many of his Baſſaes to be ſtrangled, he had been excellent in all things. But to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Victories lightly, becauſe time doth preſs us, I will onely tell you in few words, that he won a famous Battle of the Sophy at <hi>Zaleran;</hi> that he took <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> which he kept not long; and <hi>Keman</hi> at his return; he rendred himſelf Maſter of <hi>Aladulia,</hi> after he had vanquiſhed King <hi>Uſtagelu;</hi> he paſſed into <hi>Siria,</hi> where he defeated <hi>Campſon Gauri,</hi> Sultan of <hi>Cairo,</hi> in a battel neer to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> which was rendred unto him, as well as <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and all the reſt of <hi>Siria;</hi> from thence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he conquered all <hi>Paleſtina</hi> by the valour of <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Battel neer to <hi>Gaza;</hi> whereupon <hi>Selim,</hi> having paſſed the deſerts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> fought a battel vvith <hi>Thomombey</hi> hard by <hi>Matharea,</hi> and conſtrained him to retire to <hi>Cairo,</hi> where was given the moſt memorable battel of our Age, for it laſted three dayes and three nights in continuall fight; but in the end <hi>Selim</hi> was victorious, and forced the <hi>Mamelucks</hi> to abandon the City unto him; and having recovered new forces, they were utterly defeated, and <hi>Thomombey</hi> taken priſoner. After he had given the pillage of <hi>Cairo</hi> to his ſouldiers, as you may ſee in this Table, where this dreadfull diſorder is ſo well expreſt, he went and took alſo <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Victories of great <hi>Soliman</hi> are ſo univerſally known of all the World, that upon the leaſt conſidering of this Table, you will bring them unto your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory again, it being impoſſible but that fame hath acquainted you with them: You will eaſily then knovv <hi>Belgrade</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where this Emperor ſtood in need of all his conduct, and of all his valour. This Battel which you ſee a far off, is that of <hi>Mohacs</hi> vvhich he gained againſt the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> wherein dyed <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> This City, which here I ſhew you (continued <hi>Ibrahim</hi>) is <hi>Bagadet,</hi> vvhere <hi>Soliman</hi> vvas crovvned King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> but though I have ſome ſhare in this War, as well as in that of <hi>Natolia,</hi> vvhich you may ſee alſo in this Table, I will refer this narration to another time, that may be more opportune for us. I know, my dear <hi>Doria,</hi> that this propoſition diſpleaſes you, but you muſt obey me, for you vvill not be the ſtrongeſt at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and though you may abſolutely command <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> yet muſt you at this time follovv the pleaſure of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim.</hi> Let us make an end then of running over the Victories of <hi>Soliman</hi> again, and without particulariſing every one, it ſhall ſuffice me to tell you, that <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> do obey him; that he hath taken <hi>Strigonia,</hi> and <hi>Alba Regalis;</hi> that he hath made ſix expeditions into <hi>Hungary;</hi> that he hath ſubdued <hi>Aladulia,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60144:37"/> and the Kingdom of <hi>Aden,</hi> with many other Towns on the red ſea; that he hath rendred <hi>Argier</hi> Tributary; that he hath alſo ſubjected <hi>Pialli, Tripoli,</hi> and <hi>Gerbes:</hi> But after all theſe things, that which I find to be moſt excellent in the life of this Prince is, that he conquered a Kingdom for to reſtore it unto him to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, by rendring unto him again all the ſtrong places that he had in his hands, which he performed in the perſon of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and I more eſteem of him for having ſurmounted this ambition, vvhich is naturall to all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, than I commend him for all his Victories: And whereas I make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the gifts of Nature than of the preſents of Fortune, I had rather make you an Elogium of his perſon in particular, than ſpeak further to you of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, which are already but too great on Chriſtendom ſide. Behold then, my dear <hi>Doria,</hi> this Majeſticall face, and this vertuous phyſiognomy; did you ever ſee a more goodly man? or one of a better aſpect? There appears in his eyes a vivacity of ſpirit, and a ſweetneſs vvhich charmeth hearts, and in the air of his face a certain tranquillity, which ſufficiently ſhevvs that this Prince is maſter of his paſſions, and that without doubt he hath no interior trouble; I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my affection to him doth blind or dazle me, but I ſee ſomething of ſuch ſtate in his port, and of ſo much majeſty over all his perſon, as I hold it impoſſible for one to look upon him, and not to love him: Furthermore this goodly apparance is not deceitfull, and the qualities of this Princes ſoul are ſo noble and vertuous, that if he were a Chriſtian he would be of all men the moſt perfect. He hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both much valour, and much conduct; he is infinitely juſt towards his own people, and exceeding clement towards his enemies; he is ſo rigorous an obſerver of his vvord, as he vvould reſolve rather to loſe his Empire, than not to keep it, when once he hath given it: He is great in ſpirit, great in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and great in memory; he underſtands the Mathematicks, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Hiſtory, ſo admirably, as nothing can be propounded to him to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>hing thoſe matters which he reſolves not upon the place. Finally, he is a Prince that poſſeſſeth all vertues, and that hath never been vanquiſhed ſave by one only paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but whereas it is the nobleſt of all others, I think you will pardon him this weakneſs; he hath been then paſſionately amorous of divers women, but amongſt the reſt of the Sultana <hi>Roxelana,</hi> whom he would needs eſpouſe, to the end ſhe might partake with him in that ſupreme greatneſs which the <hi>Othoman</hi> Princes do not lightly beſtow, and which to conſerve wholly to themſelves, they never, or ſeldom marry; howbeit love was ſtronger in <hi>Soliman,</hi> than either reaſon of State, or the example of his Predeceſſors. Behold, my dear <hi>Doria,</hi> a ſimple draught of this great Emperor, whom ere it be long you may compare with the originall, that ſo you may judge, whether I have robbed him of any thing, or flattered him; for this great Prince hath commanded me to bring you to the Seraglio, when as I go thither to take my leave of him; in the mean ſpace, ſince we are preſſed with time, let us make an end of viewing this houſe.</p>
                  <p>In ſaying ſo, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> opened a door, which gave upon the Lobbey, whereof I have already ſpoken, but before they paſt on, <hi>Doria</hi> teſtified to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> hovv glad he was of the hope he had given him that he ſhould preſent himſelf to the Grand Signior; he rendred him thanks alſo for having ſo punctually explaned all thoſe peeces, by abridging unto him the Hiſtory of ſo great an Empire, which he had never underſtood but very confuſedly before. He would have ſaid more, if our il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Baſſa would have ſuffered him, but his impatience appeared ſo viſibly in his eyes, that <hi>Doria</hi> without further ſtay went out of the Gallery ſmiling into the Lobbey, from whence they paſt through three outward chambers, which were all of a floor, before they came to <hi>Ibrahims:</hi> the feeling of them were very magnificent, and the meaneſt of the Hangings were of cloth of Gold, of Tinſell, or Perſian Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry; the floors, as of all the reſt, vvere made of ſuitable peeces of ſeverall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and in proportionable diviſions. After he had ſtayed a vvhile to conſider all theſe things, they entred into the Baſſaes chamber, vvhere <hi>Doria</hi> vvas ſurpriſed vvith the furniture of it, both for the richneſs, and faſhion thereof; for it was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60144:38"/> hanged with black Velvet, ſet all over with tears and flames imbroidered in pearl: Here it was where <hi>Ibrahim</hi> deſired his dear <hi>Doria</hi> to remember the things which he ſhould ſee in this chamber, more particularly than all the reſt of the Palace, to the end he might teſtifie to the incomparable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that ſhe had always reigned in his heart, and that to conſerve the memory of her, he would never open his eys in waking, without beholding ſome marks of his love; he cauſed him then to obſerve, that in the feeling of this chamber were five great Ovals, in each of which was a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; between every of them hung feſtons of flowers and fruits, all gilt; the reſt of the feeling being done with corniſhments, whereof ſome were of azure, ſome of burniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gold. In the middle piece, which was greater than the reſt, was a woman repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whom <hi>Doria</hi> preſently knew, becauſe ſhe had ſomthing of <hi>Iſabella</hi> in her, although it was a very imperfect reſemblance; for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having loſt her picture, could do no more but inſtruct the Painter with the colour of her hair, with the form of her face, with all the features of it in particular, with the vivacity of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, with her ſtature, and with her boſome; for as for the air and graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which cannot be expreſt, but in calling it the ſoul of beauty, it is a thing that cannot paſs from our imagination to that of another, and that conſequently did not permit <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Painter to make any marvellous picture of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but in concluſion it was reſembling enough for to cauſe them, who knew her, to judge that ſhe was thought of when this piece was made. This imperfect reſemblance having entertained them a while, <hi>Doria</hi> conſidered all this Table, and ſaw (as I have already declared) a woman ſumptuouſly apparelled, who trampled under her feet honor, vertue, and love, which were ſeen repreſented with the marks whereby they are known; and that with her right hand, lifted up on high, ſhe took from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who appeared over her in the air, a little Crown, which ſhe ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very contentedly, with this Motto, <hi>All for her. Doria</hi> eaſily comprehended this Embleme, and no way doubted, but that the Baſſa had cauſed it to be made out of the opinion he had, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had deſpiſed her love, her promiſes, and her conſtancy, to eſpouſe the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> who was but a petty Soveraign. After he had commended the art of the Painter, and the invention of the deſign, the Baſſa leading him towards one of the corners of the chamber, the better to view the ſecond Ovall, demanded of him whether this other Table would be as intelligible to him as the firſt? <hi>Doria</hi> approaching to it, and conſidering it, beheld a Love, in whoſe face choler and fury were ſo well painted, as it was eaſie to imagine that he himſelf had burſt his bow, broken his arrows, thrown away his quiver, and torn his head-band, which were ſeen ſcattered about him; and that which better expreſſed his deſpair, was, that having nothing left him of all the marks of his Divinity but his torch, he plunged it, all flaming as it was, into a fountain to extinguiſh it, with this Motto, <hi>I cannot. Doria</hi> vvas ſo raviſhed with this Table, as he could not forbear conſidering all the beauties of it, and vvhereas the explication of it vvas eaſie, he told the Baſsa, that he vvould pardon him for that he vvould have extinguiſhed ſo fair a fire as that vvherevvith he vvas inflamed, at ſuch a time as he thought it to be unjuſt, but that he held him happy for that he could not do it, and for having conſerved a flame, vvhich he could not put out vvithout a crime: After this he admired the Art of the Painter, and principally of the torch, vvhich this Love plunged into the fountain, vvhere the excellent Workman had ſo vvell repreſented that naturall antipathy betvvixt vvater and fire, as never did any one behold a thing better imitated: This fountain ſeemed to boil vvith choler to ſee her enemy ſo neer her; and this flame deſiring to eloign it ſelf from that which would deſtroy it, ſeemed exceedingly to ſtrive to get from it, and riſing up on high in wreathing about the torch, melted ſo great a quantity of wax, as all the fountain ſeemed to be covered over vvith it. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> not ſuffering <hi>Doria</hi> to admire this piece any longer, conſtrained him to look upon the third, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him hovvſoever not to beſtovv much time in it, becauſe that Table did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as vvell as another vvhich he ſhould ſee aftervvards: He ſhevved him then the ſame vvoman he had ſeen before, but in a different habit; for here the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60144:38"/> Painter had given her a robe of changeable Taffeta, vvhere all colours reigned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually; this vvoman vvas on the brink of the Sea, the agitation vvhereof ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held vvith delight; in one hand ſhe held a Creſcent, vvith the other ſhe ſeemed to point at a Camelion, vvhich vvas at her feet, and that leaning his body on a part of her robe had aſſumed all the colours of it; the reſt of that creature vvas grayiſh like to the earth vvhereon it ſtood, vvith this Motto, <hi>Yet more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Doria</hi> had ſeen this piece, he told the Baſſa, that he had reaſon to ſay it did outrage <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in accuſing her of inconſtancy, but ſince this crime had been committed through the malice of fortune, he ſhould one day obtain his grace for it: This ſaid, they paſſed to the other end of the chamber, and beheld in the fourth Table, a proper man, and of a good aſpect, that ſeemed very ſad; he had on the one ſide the ſame <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whom they had ſeen before, and on the other, death, with this Motto, <hi>The one, or the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although this piece was admirably well done, yet would not <hi>Doria</hi> ſtay to conſider it, but onely told the Baſſa, that the noble deſpair which he had ſhevved in this Table, rendred him vvorhy to be put, at his return to <hi>Genoua,</hi> into the poſſeſſion of an happineſs, which he could never loſe again but by death alone; hovvbeit in the mean time he vvas moſt aſſured, that albeit this picture did not fill the imaginination vvith a fair Idea, yet vvould it be more pleaſing to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> than that other, vvhere the Painter had given her a roab of all the colours of the Rain-bovv. The Baſſa then puſhing him to the other ſide of the chamber, told him, that this, vvhich he was novv going to ſhevv him, vvould not like enough pleaſe her ere a vvhit more, if ſhe had not the goodneſs to conſider, that his love had hovvſoever been ſo ſtrong, as to make him conſerve vvith ſome delight the very marks of her contempt, and inconſtancie, vvhich he had believed to be true; he cauſed <hi>Doria</hi> then to behold the laſt picture of this ſeeling. It vvas a Land-skip, vvhere the Princes vvas ſeen again holding an heart in her hand, that vvas all of a flame, and not far from her a great fire of ſtravv, vvhere the Painter had ſo vvell imitated nature, as it vvas eaſie to perceive, that hovv vive ſoever this flame vvas, yet could it not long indure: There vvere alſo flaſhes of lightning ſeen darting at her head, vvith his Motto, <hi>Leſs durable.</hi>

                     <hi>Doria</hi> then accuſed <hi>Ibrahim</hi> of injuſtice, and told him, that if this piece had been leſs excellent, he ſhould hardly have pardoned him the wrong he did <hi>Iſabella,</hi> but he vvas ſo raviſhed to ſee thoſe vvaving flames, vvvhich came out of a cloud, and that ſpread themſelves over all the piece, leaving an impreſſion of fire and light, vvhich ſeemed even to redouble, and leſſen, as if the cloud had opened, and ſhut i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uch aggregation, as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> vvas conſtrained to urge him more than once to view a picture, which he had cauſed to be ſet over his Chimney: Now he had no ſooner caſt his eye upon it, but he vowed it was the beſt of them all; the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it was rare, the deſign extraordinary and new, the colours moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the proſpective excellent; in concluſion this Table was drawn with ſo bold an hand, as it might well be called a Maſter-piece of this art. A rock was ſeen there in the midſt of an inraged Sea, which the Painter had done ſo well, as thoſe foaming waves, that brok themſelves againſt the rock, ſeemed to have ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There was ſeen alſo a little from thence the wrack of a Veſſell, whereon the thunder fell, which was ſeen to iſſue like a torrent of fire out of the cloud, that ſeemed to rive aſunder with ſuch violence, as little lacked but that one ſenſe delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded did not deceive the other, in making it to imagine that it heard that, which was ſeen ſo well repreſented. This mervailous Artiſan had likewiſe ſo well pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that confuſed mixture, which is ſeen in the air during a great tempeſt, where rain, wind, ſnow, hail, flaſhes of lightning, and obſcurity, reign all at once, that one could not behold it without ſome terror: Vpon the top of this rock was an open tomb ſeen, whereunto a man, weary, and wet all over, advanced in great haſt, holding a Love in one hand, and with the other pointing to the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You will without doubt find another ſanctuary, ſaid <hi>Doria</hi> to the illuſtrious Baſſa, who, anſwering him no otherwiſe than with a ſigh, made him enter into his Cabinet, the door whereof was on the right hand of the chimney, not far from his bed, which after the cuſtom of the Country was rolled up in a great Perſian ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry Counterpoint of ſilke and gold. But if <hi>Doria</hi> had admired all that he had ſeen in this Palace, he beheld with aſtoniſhment the magnificence of this Cabinet, whereof the embowed roof and walles were inriched with a foliage of pretious ſtones, upon a ground of black marble, where birds, flowers, and fruites, were ſeen ſo admirably well done, that the art ſurmounted the matter, although Topazes, Jacints, Opales, Emeraulds, Rubies, Diamonds, and Carbuncles were the colours wherewith all theſe things were repreſented. Round about this Cabinet were ſhelves of Ebony, ſuſtained by curtroſes of gold, which projected out of the wall wall by equall diſtances, the edges, and uper part of theſe ſhelves, were enriched with Orpheury, enammeled onely with white and black, the better to ſet off thoſe things which were upon them; but to ſpeak that in few words, and confuſedly, which would be too long to deſcribe in order, one might ſee there Caskets of different Ambers, great Vaſes of Chriſtall of the rock, of Cornaline, and Agate, with branches of Corrall, which might rather be called trees, by reaſon of their prodigious greatneſs: Finally, all that <hi>Perſia, China, Japon,</hi> and all the Orientall Countries do produce of moſt rare, rich, and beautifull, were found amaſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this place. After that <hi>Doria</hi> had ſaid all, that admiration, and amazement can make them ſay, who love, and know rarities, they repaſſed through the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to go unto a door that was oppoſite to that of the Cabinet, whereby one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Bath, who, being accommodated with all exterior things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of the Country where he lived, did not fail in having a goodly and magnificent one. It was a place ſpacious enough, in form Octangular, invironed about with ſeates, whereunto one aſcended by four ſteps of Jaſper, and Chalcedony, whereof the two lovvermoſt vvere covered vvith vvater even up to the brim of the third, the fourth being vvholly out of the vvater: At each of the eight angles vvas a Colum, after the Corinthian manner, of Jaſper mingled vvith divers colours; the Columnes were planted on the fourth ſtep, which ſerved them for a pedeſtall, with their Baſes, Capitalls, Frizes, and Corniches; the Frize was carved in half relieve, where naked children were ſeen, who ſeemed to combat in the water with little Sea Monſters, and to wraſtle with them, with efforts ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their yeares, as the workman deſerved no little glory for the ſame. All theſe figures were ſo lively ſet forth, as they ſeemed to move, ſo eaſily may the imagination be deceived by things that are well repreſented; over the Frize was the Corniſh, and above that juſt perpendicular to every Column roſe up a twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wreath of Oaken leaves, laid one upon another, made of green Jaſper, and bound with filets of gold, mounting up on the ribbs of the vaulting, and meeting the middle in the form of a Chaplet of Triumph. All the walls were overlaid with a compound ſtone, called <hi>Aventurina,</hi> and whereof they ſeemed to be framed, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently was this work contrived. But amongſt all the beauties of the place the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt was, that between thoſe eight Columns, whereof I have already ſpoken, there were as many Niches, four of which were filled with great Vaſes of gold, that ſerved to lay the perfumes in, and other things neceſſary to the Bath; the other four, which ſeparated thoſe former, were filled with four Nimphes of white mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo admirably fair, as Nature hath never made any thing more beautifull, than the Idea of this excellent workman: Theſe figures were all in different actions; ſome of them ſeemed to uncloth themſelves for to enter into the Bath; others to come out of it, putting on their cloathes again; but all with ſuch art, as <hi>Doria</hi> confeſſed, that Sculpture had never ſhewed any thing more perfect. He conſidered alſo that the water, which was ſeen in the Bath, fell into it through two Vaſes of Chriſtall, which were held by two men, laid along on the brim of the Bath, and repreſented as Rivers uſe to to be painted: Out of one the Vaſes iſſued hot water, and out of the other cold, to the end one might by that mixture find
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60144:39"/> that juſt mediocrity requiſite for thoſe that bath. After he had ſeen all theſe things, the grand Viſier made <hi>Doria</hi> go forth at a ſecret door, and paſs down by a back ſtair to one of the doores of the Hall; and though it be the cuſtom of the Turkes in generall not to be very coſtly in their dyet, yet as the Grandes do not uſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common faſhion, ſo <hi>Ibrahim</hi> left not to be in that particular, as in all other things. <hi>Doria</hi> ſaw in the middle of the Hall a great Perſian Carpet extended on the ground, with a Table-cloth after the manner of the Country, upon which were ſet a many of ſilver Chargers, where in each of them were ſeen twelve great diſhes of that which we call the eſſence of porcelain, repleniſhed with divers ſortes of meates; for it is the cuſtom of the Turkes never to eat in any mettall; howbeit they are not without great ſtore of ſilver veſſell, onely for magnificence; and indeed the grand Viſiers Cubbord of plate was ſo ſumptuous, as <hi>Europe</hi> hath not a King that can ſhew ſo fair a one. <hi>Doria</hi> then beholding that prodigious amaſs of Baſons of gold engraven, great Vaſes of ſundry formes and of divers bigneſſes, Flaggons, vvater Pots, and Ciſternes of gold, vvith Lions muzles and Dolphins, half imboſt, could not forbear telling <hi>Ibrahim</hi> that <hi>Iſabella</hi> vvould dye for joy, if ſhe certainly knew at what rate he bought the poſſeſſion of her; but the Baſſa returning him no other anſwer thereunto than a ſigh, told <hi>Doria</hi> it was time to dine, that they might afterwards go and take their leave of <hi>Soliman;</hi> that in the mean ſpace, whereas their exterior ceremonies were different, although their minds were not, he had given order that he ſhould be ſerved in his chamber. <hi>Doria</hi> went out then of this Hall, after he had obſerved, that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Carpet was ſet all about with great Cuſhions of cloth of Gold, upon Carpets of the ſame ſtuff, for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and the Officers of the Empire which did eat with him, to ſit upon. The Baſſa would have conducted his dear <hi>Doria</hi> to his lodging, but he would not ſuffer him, ſo that he was conſtrained to leave him in the hands of an <hi>Italian</hi> ſlave, in whom he confided for all things. Theſe two friends were not long at meat, for at this time love and friendſhip produced the ſame impatiency in them both; the Baſſa came into <hi>Doriaes</hi> chamber juſt as he was going out, having taken a reſolution together to go immediately to the Seraglio, that they might part away the night enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Italian</hi> ſlave aſſured the Baſſa, that in the evening he ſhould have ſuch an habit as <hi>Doria</hi> wore; for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had cauſed him to quit that of a ſlave, as ſoon as he was at liberty, and by the means of thoſe Jews, of vvhom I have already ſpoken, procured him one of the <hi>Italian</hi> faſhion. They vvent avvay then to the Seraglio, where being arrived, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> made <hi>Doria</hi> put on a Turkiſh robe, no ſtranger being permitted to ſpeak to the Sultan but with this ceremony. The Baſſa entred in firſt, to let his Highneſs know, that according to his order he had brought his dear <hi>Doria; Soliman</hi> ſhevved himſelf much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therewith, hovvbeit though he vvere ſomewhat impatient to ſee him, yet would he for all that ſpeak once more to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> without witneſſes, wherefore he cauſed him to paſs along with him into his Cabinet, vvhither he vvas no ſooner come, but looking on our illuſtrious Baſſa with eyes where generoſity combatted grief, and retaining the tears which kindneſs and amity would have ſhed in this hard ſeparation, he ſpake unto him with ſuch obliging terms, as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was not long without partaking with him in his melancholy, ſo certain it is that paſſions do eaſily paſs from one ſpirit to another, as well in friendſhip, as in love. The Sultan having obſerved by the change of the Baſſaes countenance, that his ſoul was moved, deſired his pardon for having troubled his pleaſure, and accuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of inhumanity for not letting him part without ſhewing his grief, to the end he might not have excited his; but to excuſe him in this incounter he was onely to conſider, that the love he bare him was ſo ſtrong, as he would with leſs pain divide with him his Empire, than be ſeparated from him; that nevertheleſs he was generous enough not to repent him of the grace which he had granted him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the execution of it was more difficult than he had thought it to be; but to comfort him in his abſence, he prayed him not to take it ill, if he deſired one oath more from him, which might aſſure him he would within ſix moneths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Conſtantinople. Soliman</hi> had no ſooner done ſpeaking, but the Grand Viſier,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60144:40"/> who never gave place to any man in generoſity, caſt himſelf at his feet, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted unto him, that he would not depart before his Highneſs had teſtified that he would rely on the word he had given him to return preciſely with in the time prefixed; that he eſteemed himſelf very unhappy in not being known to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that which he was, and that being neither baſe, ingratefull, nor a lyar, he vvas for all that ſuſpected of thoſe three crimes by a Prince, for whom he would ſacrifice his life with joy, who reigned in his heart far more abſolutely, than over his people, and who touched his ſoul with ſo much tenderneſs, as he plainly felt that he could not turn his ſteps towards <hi>Iſabella,</hi> without turning his eyes towards <hi>Soliman. Ibrahim</hi> pronounced theſe laſt words with ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, as the Sultan no way doubted but that he had truly expreſſed his heart; he raiſed him up then in imbracing him, and promiſed him that he would live in ſome quiet of this aſſurance of ſeeing him again; that in the mean time it was not juſt to let <hi>Doria</hi> ſtay any longer without, and that therefore he ſhould go and fetch him in. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> obeying this commandement, called him at the door of the Cabinet; as ſoon as he appeared <hi>Soliman</hi> ſpake to him in his own language, for, as I have already ſaid, this Prince underſtood it perfectly, and made him ſuch an Elogium of our Illuſtrious Baſſa, as cauſed him to bluſh more than once; he ſpake of his valour, of his prudence, and of his conduct in great matters; finally he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, that he was as good a Generall of an Army, as he was a good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend; he told him further, that he deſired him to receive his friendſhip, as he already poſſeſſed his, having begun to love him as ſoon as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had made known to him, by the recitall of his adventures, what his merit was, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he bore him; moreover, that as all the intereſts of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> were his, ſo he gave him thanks not only for all the ſervices he had rendred him, but for all thoſe which he ſhould render him in time to come; and for a mark of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation wherein he would ſtand ingaged to him for it, he conjured him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a Scymitar which he gave him, whereof the hilt and ſcabberd were all covered over with Diamonds. <hi>Doria</hi> anſwered to all theſe things with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that he owed to ſo great a Prince, and being fallen on his knees to receive that precious gage of <hi>Solimans</hi> liberality, he was vvith a great deal of ſweetneſs and civility taken up by the Sultan, who prayed him to aſſure <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that the conſtancy of her <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had been ſo firm during the time that he beleeved her to be unfaithfull, as he durſt ſwear for him, that he had never ſought after, nor affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory, but out of the hope of dying more nobly; he entreated him alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her from him with a box of Gold, ſet with Emeraulds, which was filled with two Chains, the firſt vvas of Diamonds of an exceſſive greatneſs, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Pearls, ſo big, ſo round, ſo even, and ſo clear, that the Orient hath never ſhewed us fairer. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> would have ſpoken to render <hi>Soliman</hi> thanks, and to have made himſelf the bearer of that Treaſure, but he impoſed ſilence on him, and ſayd, that it would be enongh for him to entertain <hi>Iſabella</hi> with his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, without charging himſelf with a complement from another. But at laſt the Sultan being unwilling that <hi>Doria</hi> ſhould ſee him capable of any weakneſs, and feeling that this converſation could not long endure without his falling again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to melancholy, he told the Baſſa that he had given order unto the Teſqueregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſi, who is the Grand Signiors principall Secretary, to make up the Ambaſſador of <hi>Genouaes</hi> diſpatch; that his Letter was conceived in ſuch preſſing terms, as that Republique durſt not refuſe what he deſired of it; that in the mean time, ſince he muſt reſolve to ſee him depart, he thought it fit that he ſhould go and give order to his affairs, to the end he might as ſoon as it was night repair to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Genouaes</hi> veſſell, which he had cauſed to come from <hi>Pera</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and would attend for them at the Port. This ſayd, he diſmiſſed <hi>Doria,</hi> after he had teſtified much affection unto him, and retained <hi>Ibrahim</hi> for one moment more to take his laſt farewell of him; it was at this inſtant that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhewed the greateſt marks of his good-will to the Grand Viſier, ſince it is moſt certain, that ſilent ſorrows, though they be not ſo eloquent as others, yet are they at the leaſt more perſwaſive. When <hi>Doria</hi> was gone the Sultan imbraced <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60144:40"/> howſoever he forced himſelf, he could ſay no more, than go my dear <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Iſabella</hi> to life again, but when you ſhall have revived her, come and preſerve mine. This diſcourſe touched the Baſſa ſo vively, as all the anſwer he could make was, that his return ſhould quickly juſtifie his departure; after which <hi>Soliman</hi> made a ſign to him to be gone. He went avvay then to his dear <hi>Doria,</hi> who ſtayed for him in another chamber; in their way back they talked of nothing but great <hi>Soliman; Doria</hi> was ſo ſatisfied of him, as he was conſtrained to confeſs, that he ſhould want common ſenſe if he were not charmed by the rare qualities of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Prince. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> anſwered hereunto with ſo much melancholy, as <hi>Doria</hi> was fain to ſpeak of the Princeſs to him for to draw him out of it; wherefore he dextrouſly told him, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> would be aſtoniſhed at the preſent which ſhe ſhould receive from him. At this ſweet name <hi>Ibrahim</hi> began to take heart again, and ſomewhat diſſipating his heavyneſs, he turned all his thoughts to his departure. As ſoon as he vvas at his Palace, he entred with <hi>Doria</hi> into his chamber, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent for the Italian ſlave, he underſtood by him, that his habit was ready; whereupon he called the principall Officers of his houſe once more before him, and told them that he was going to depart away upon that occaſion wherewith he had acquainted them before, and therefore they ſhould give order to the Porter of his Palace, that he might not be troubled for the reſt of the day, but to ſend ſuch as came about generall affairs to the Baſſa of the Sea, who during his abſence was to deal for him: After this he commanded them to withdravv, and remained alone with <hi>Doria,</hi> and the ſlave that had brought him his habit. Now the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to approach, he held it time to think of parting, and this ſlave being of counſell with them, was appointed by him to go and take that other of <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> and conduct him to the Port, whether they would come to them. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having put on his habit, took ſome Jewels with him, in caſe hee ſhould ſtand in any need upon the way by ſome unexpected incounter, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be dark enough for them to go forth without diſcovery, he cauſed <hi>Doria</hi> to deſcend by a back-ſtair, which brought them to a door that opened into the Garden, the paſſage out of the which not being far diſtant from the Port, gave them the commodity to get thither eaſily without being ſeen. And whereas <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> knew preciſely whereabout the Chriſtian veſſels lay, and eſpecially thoſe of Ambaſſadors, he went directly to the place, where he was attended for by the order of the Teſqueregibaſſi, who when he gave the Ambaſſador his diſpatch, had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to be as ſoon as it was night at the Key, there to receive the two ſlaves of whom he had been ſpoken unto him at ſuch time as he had audience from his Highneſs: According hereunto, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> (whom we will hereafter call <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>) after he had overtaken the ſlave of <hi>Monaco,</hi> found out the Ambaſſador, who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, received him and <hi>Doria</hi> with tranſports of joy that cannot be expreſt; he could not comprehend how two men, who were beleeved to be dead ſo long before, ſhould be met withall at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> But if his joy were exceſſive, that of our two friends was not leſs, for they knew him exceeding well, as being of the Illuſtrious family of the <hi>Lomelines. Juſtiniano</hi> thought then that he began already to breath the air of his country; but the place being nothing commodious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in, they embarqued themſelves, and a little after, when the Moon was up they weighed Anchor, and hoiſting up their ſayls, they made towards the Weſt, with ſo favourable a wind as the Art of the Pilot was almoſt unprofitable in this encounter. This proſperous beginning of Navigation made the Mariners to ſhout for joy, and gave them hope, that they ſhould ſee the coaſt of <hi>Genoua</hi> ere it were long. But amidſt the common gladneſs, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> could not forget that he went from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> without quitting it utterly, and that by an inviſible chain, which retained him there, he was to return unto it a ſlave from <hi>Iſabella;</hi> this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome thought for all that laſted not long, and his imaginations flattered him ſo ſweetly, in making him ſee that he was every minute drawing near unto the Princeſs, as loſing the ſight of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he alſo loſt the remembrance of all his misfortunes, and abandoned himſelf wholly to joy.</p>

But to favour the impatience he was in to be with <hi>Iſabella,</hi> let us only ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out particularizing his courſe, that after he was come to all the Veſſells, which the Grand Signior had cauſed to be arreſted, and drawn out of captiviy all the Chriſtian Slaves which were found in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Ports where they touched, by vertue of an abſolute power that he had from the Sultan; after, I ſay, that he had paſſed the Archipelago, and left <hi>Ciprus</hi> on the left hand, this proſperous Fleet arrived in a few dayes within ſight of the Land of <hi>Genoua:</hi> There it was where the Ambaſſador began to reap the fruit of his voyage, by the pleaſure he took in thinking that he was going to enter into his City, as it were in triumph, by bringing thither again thoſe ſo many Veſſels which reſtored to the People their kindred and friends, to the Nobility their children and their riches, and to the Senate the Grace of the Grand Signior, and the lives of two Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Citizens. As for <hi>Doria,</hi> he felt that motion in his ſoul, which Nature gives to all thoſe who ſee their Country again after a long exile, and that not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the unrulineſs of paſſions following without reſiſtance the thoughts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe inſpires them; he had then an extreme pleaſure, but yet it was a quiet pleaſure. But for <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> it was not ſo with him, he did not look upon this Land as the place of his birth, but as the reſidence of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and in an inſtant he paſſed over again in his memory all that had arrived unto him there; and his tranſport was ſo great, that joy produced ſome effects of grief in him; he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged colour divers times, he was unquiet and muſing, and if <hi>Doria</hi> had not forced him to ſpeak, and expreſs his minde by his diſcourſe, it was to be doubted in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, whether it were hope, or whether it were fear, that agitated his ſoul; whether he regretted <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or deſired <hi>Genoua;</hi> ſo certain it is that violent paſſions pervert the uſe of the ſenſes. Tears, which ought not to be but the marks of ſorrow, ſerve ſometimes for joy; and ſilence, which ſeems ſo proper for ſadneſs, is often the effect of an extreme pleaſure; but as we come to one and the ſame place by divers wayes, they were made contented by different cauſes, and expreſſed their joy in ſeverall manners. In the mean time they came ſtill neerer to <hi>Genoua,</hi> but not holding it ſit that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> ſhould enter into
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60144:41"/> the City before the deliberation of the Senate was known, the Ambaſſador cauſed his Veſſell to caſt anchor three miles from <hi>Genoua,</hi> and going to paſs into another, after he had aſſured them that he would obtain their liberty, or be exiled with them, he obſerved that <hi>Alphonſo Spinola,</hi> Captain of one of thoſe redeemed Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and brother to him whom <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had ſlain in defending <hi>Rhodolpho,</hi> hung back, and would not follow him, whereupon he would needs know the cauſe of it; but <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> whoſe generoſity was extreme, ſeeing himſelf obliged for his life, and for his liberty to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who during the voyage had teſtified unto him with much reſentment the grief he had had for the misfortune wherein he had been ingaged; and knowing likewiſe that the death of his brother had hapned with ſome juſtice, he beſought the Ambaſſador not to think it ſtrange if he did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him to <hi>Genoua,</hi> being abſolutely reſolved never to enter into it without his Deliverer; that knowing his Father, as he did, he was well aſſured that he would with all his power oppoſe them that would revoke the Sentence which had been given againſt <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> ſo that to hinder his violence, he purpoſed to write unto him, that if he would have his ſonne again, he muſt pardon his enemy; that his fortune was conjoyned with his, and that he would never have ſuch a reproach laid upon him, as that a man, who had drawn him out of fetters, and brought him back into his Countrey, ſhould not injoy the liberty which he had given him. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> pronounced this ſpeech with ſo much earneſtneſs, as all that heard him were raviſhed with his reſolution; and <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was ſo charmed therewith, that not able to forbear imbracing him, and not ſuffering him to ſay more, he conjured him that he would not force him to be ingratefull; that if nothing but his blood would ſatisfie the revenge of his kindred, he would be moſt ready to ſhed it for his ſake, but having ſome hope to ſerve them more profitably in his perſon, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould preſent it ſelf, he would ſpare no care nor good office for it, ſo as it might be done without offence to his honor; that he had performed a gallant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in deſiring to ſtay with him, but that he ſhould do an unworthy one, and full of inhumanity if he ſhould conſent unto it; and that therefore it was more juſt, that he ſhould go and dry up his fathers tears, and moderate his fury by the joy which his ſight would bring him, than to do a thing that would procure him his hatred. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> did not yeeld at firſt to the deſire of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> but the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and <hi>Doria</hi> ſiding with him, he was conſtrained to ſubmit to their ſenſe, and to let his inclination be overcome by anothers reaſon. Theſe illuſtrious friends parted with ſo much adoe, as if <hi>Doria</hi> had not perceived by <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> watch, that the time of the Senates Aſſembly preſſed the Ambaſſador to depart, if he would have audience as ſoon as he ſhould arrive, they would have ſpent a great part of the day in this noble conteſtation, whereof all the glory conſiſted in obliging his enemy. But whilſt this Fleet reaſumed their courſe to aboard <hi>Genoua,</hi> let us go to the Port, and ſee what the people think of it, and whether this agreeable ſurprize will make them ſend forth ſhouts of joy in anſwer to thoſe of the Mariners. As ſoon as theſe Veſſells began to appear, a confuſed noiſe was heard amongſt thoſe that were preſent on the ſhore, whereby it appeared that they expected not ſo happy a ſucceſs of their Ambaſſadors voyage; the one ſaid that the Senate was to be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of it; others, that Merchants Veſſells came not in ſo great a number together; ſome, that Pirats durſt not approch in that manner if they were not followed by the body of an Army; and all of them together, that the beſt was to give intelligence thereof, to the end ſome might be ſent to diſcover them; there were thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whoſe imagination was ſo troubled with fear, as they verily believed that they diſtinctly ſaw Turkiſh Galleys, and half Moons. In the mean time, whereas the Fleet came ſtill neerer, they might eaſily diſcern, that it was the Standard of the Republique which theſe Veſſells carried, the ſight whereof diſſipated their fear, but it took not from them their amazement, being not able to imagine how they ſhould be ſo neer unto them, whom they believed to be in chains and ſlavery; but at length the firſt of theſe Veſſells being come to the ſhore, and the Ambaſſador, who was ſeen on the poop, being known of the people, which were already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60144:42"/> together in a very great number, and they no longer doubting but that theſe veſſells, which now they knew, brought them back both their brethren, and their children, ſuch a noiſe of acclamations aroſe on the ſuddain, as they all ſpake without underſtanding what they ſaid themſelves, and without being underſtood of others; wives called for their husbands; fathers inquired after their children; ſome ran into the City to advertiſe their friends of it; others ran out of it with their whole families; they in the Veſſells cryed to let them know whether all were well at home; at laſt ſo great a noiſe was formed of all theſe cries and murmures, as the Ambaſſador had much adoe to make his orders be underſtood: He comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Chieftaines to accompany him to the Palace, and particularly <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> not to be far from him; they traverſed the City in this ſort, followed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular multitude, who ceaſed not from teſtifying their joy, both by their teares, and by their acclamation. When they were at the Gate of the Palace, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador advanced three or four ſteps before his Troop, that he might the better ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe that honorable Company. At his firſt appearing they ſought to know the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his voyage in his face, but as ſoon as they perceived all the Commanders of their Veſſells, the graveſt and moſt moderate amongſt them could not chuſe but ſhew ſignes of their amazement, and joy; and when this firſt emotion was appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Ambaſſador, having made a low obeiſance to the Duke, and the like to the whole aſſembly, began to ſpeak in this ſort.</p>

                  <p>IF the proſperous ſucceſs of my voyage had been an effect of my conduct, of my care, and of my addreſs, I ſhould without doubt have had ſo much modeſty as to declare in few words the eſtate of things, for to attend from ſo honorable an Aſſembly the praiſe which a ſervice of ſuch importance would have deſerved, without giving them to my ſelf; and I ſhould alſo have been ſo generous, as to have been fully ſatisfied with the onely thought of having been profitable to my Country; but whereas I have no part in the glory of this action, but contrarily I my ſelf am obliged for my life to the Deliverer of ſo many illuſtrious Slaves as I have brought you back, and which are all, either your kinſmen, or your friends, it behoves me, both that I may not be ingratefull in my particular, and that alſo I may keep you from being ſo in generall, to report fathfully unto you how the matter hath paſt, to the end that by underſtanding all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances you may the better know, how it is the intereſt of the Republique, which makes me ſpeak with ſo much earneſtneſs.</p>
                  <p>You are to underſtand then, my Lords, that whereas the Emperor <hi>Soliman</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Law of Nations had been violated in the perſon of his Chaoux, he thought that he might doe the like in that of your Ambaſſador, ſo that as ſoon as I was arrived at <hi>Pera,</hi> and that according to the cuſtom I had demanded audience of his Highneſs, I ſaw my ſelf conſtrained to paſs by his order from my Veſſell into a ſtreight priſon, without telling me the cauſe therof, in ſuch ſort as he that came to obtain the liberty of others, ſaw himſelf deprived of his own, and laden with chaines. I was two dayes intreated in this manner with a great deal of rigor, and I very well perceived by the countenance of them which guarded me, that they believed my head was the onely price of my liberty. As I was in this unquietneſs I ſaw the Aga of the Janizaries enter, who cauſed me to be told by Dragoman of the grand Signioes, whom we call an interpreter, that his Highneſs willing to give me audience had commanded him to conduct me to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> without any ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; this mutation ſurpriſed me ſo much the more, for that I could not imagine the cauſe of it, having been well enough informed, that <hi>Soliman</hi> doth not eaſily change his reſolutions, and that repenting is a motion of the ſoul which is almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him: In the mean time I beheld my fetters broken off, without ſeeing

The moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Servitude hath ever found ſome rebellion in the minds of thoſe who have imbraced it; and if the Religion which we profeſs, did not prohibit us, from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of our ſelves, there is not a Slave amongſt the Turks that would not make himſelf away with joy, to get out of the miſeries which he indures; for if one hath ſeen at other times both men and women to have recourſe to this extreme remedy, becauſe they were for one day only to follow the Chariot of the Victorious, bound with chains of gold, what ought not men do, who laden with irons are ſent to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the black Sea, where it may be ſaid that they enter alive into their graves, being put into deep holes where horror and darkneſs, which always reign there, are the leaſt of their pains?

At laſt, my Lords, if <hi>Philippo</hi> will preſerve his ſon he muſt joyn his prayers to thoſe of all the people, who conjure you to accord the grace of him who hath filled your City with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, &amp; all the families of <hi>Genoua</hi> with joy; all the acclamations of gladneſs, which you hear at the Palace gate, ſpeak to you for pardon and mercy; but if you oppoſe the ſeverity of the Laws to prayers ſo juſt, ſo preſſing, and neceſſary for the publick tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, I have to anſwer you, that it is not to offend them, but to ſatisfie juſtice, which ought to be the rule of them; and that the ſame Lawes, which will have a crime puniſhed, will alſo have vertue recompenced. If there be need of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sentences that have been revoked, all antiquity will furniſh us therewith: <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was baniſhed by the Oſtraciſme, and repealed within three yeares after; <hi>Cimon</hi> was exiled from <hi>Athens,</hi> and intreated to return, even by thoſe that had driven him away; at <hi>Sparta</hi> one <hi>Leontidas</hi> was uſed in the ſame manner; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Lacedemonians. Philoxenus</hi> had the ſame fortune; and if we will go to <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall find, that <hi>Seneca</hi> was baniſhed by <hi>Claudius,</hi> and called home again by him for ſome praiſes which he had given him in a letter of conſolation, that he wrote to <hi>Polibius</hi> his favorite; judge now my Lords, whether flattery ſpoken with a good grace may enter into compariſon with the ſervice that <hi>Jnſtiniano</hi> hath rendred you. But to paſs from antiquity to the modern age, have we not ſeen amongſt the Venetians <hi>Hortenſio Contarini</hi> condemned to a perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who returned into his Country a little after with the ſame honors which he formely had there? And without going to ſeek for authorities amongſt our neighbors, which we may find amongſt our ſelves, hath not one ſeen <hi>Antonia Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goza</hi> exiled for ever from his Country, who nevertheleſs was by a decree from the Senate reſtored to his former liberty in <hi>Genoua?</hi> I could alſo find many other particulars in Hiſtory to confirm my propoſition, but I think it may ſuffice, that <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have marked you out the way, which you may follow without fear of failing, after ſo many Illuſtrious examples. Howbeit you will peradventure ſay, that albeit you could infringe your Lawes in favor of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> becauſe he hath done you ſuch great ſervices, yet <hi>Doria</hi> cannot pretend to the ſame grace, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he himſelf oweth his liberty to our Deliverer; but I am to anſwer you for the glory of this diſintereſſed friend, who hazarded his life, by a generoſity without example, to revenge the outrage which the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran</hi> did to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> that this action ſeemed ſo gallant to <hi>Soliman,</hi> when as <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> recounted it unto him, that he hath judged <hi>Doria</hi> worthy of his protection: Beſides do you not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the intereſts of theſe two illuſtrious perſons can ever be ſeparated. And to tell you all that I think in this incounter, prepare your ſelves to execute vvhat I have promiſed, or reſolve to loſe at the ſame inſtant all the commanders of your Veſſells, who have every one, as vvell as my ſelf, ſolemnly ſworn never to enjoy the liberty vvhich <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> hath gotten us, unleſs he be partaker of it vvith us. As for me, vvho doe certainly knovv of vvhat importance this affair is for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, I ſhould think that I ſhould betray my Country, if I ſhould conceal the eagernes vvhich I obſerved in the mind of <hi>Soliman,</hi> vvhen as he told me that one of his ſlaves having found grace in his ſight, had beſought him to pardon us; and that he had conſented thereunto, provided that you ſhould revoke the Sentences, which you had given againſt <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Doria;</hi> wherein if you failed, he ſwore in fury,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60144:43"/> that he would come with all the forces of his Empire to deſtroy our Republique. It is no longer then, my Lords, a particular intereſt; it is no longer the merit of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> that is to be conſidered in this occaſion; it is not for the hope of brave things that he will doe hereafter, that this grace is to be accorded him; it is not for our ranſom that he is to be received with joy; it is not becauſe I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it that it is to be reſolved on; it is not becauſe reaſon doth counſell it; it is not becauſe juſtice doth ordain it; but it is becauſe neceſſity will have it ſo. You will ſay to me, it may be, that the ſucceſs of this War would ſtill be doubtfull, but, my Lords, if you conſider the inequality of your forces you will not doubt at all, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a time wherein all the Princes of Chriſtendom are not in a condition to aſſiſt their Allies. Shall it be from the Emperor that you will be protected in this occaſion, who findes himſelf too much intangled in the War with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and in the affaires of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> for to think of yours? Shall it be from the Kingdomes of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> that you look for ſuccor, they that are exhauſted both of men and money for the Emperor their Maſter? Shall it be from the <hi>Switzers,</hi> or the <hi>Griſons,</hi> that we ſhall be aſſiſted in this incounter, they that are ingaged in all theſe Warres, and that are more likely rather to ſide with the ſtronger party, than to ſuccor the weaker? It may be that the French will furniſh us with that vvhich we cannot find elſewhere, but, my Lords, were they not in War with the Emperor, yet would they ſee us periſh with joy, and the Armies of the Turks could not doe that amongſt us, which they would not do here with theirs, if they were in an eſtate to be revenged on us for our changing. You will tell me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Republiques of <hi>Florence, Siena</hi> and <hi>Lucca</hi> are not ſo far of, but that one may be ſuccoured from them, but they are ſo ingaged in thoſe two parties, as they have not the liberty to diſpoſe of their forces. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might alſo do ſomething for you if he were peaceable in his State, but he himſelf is ſo buſied in preparing to hinder the paſſage of the French, as he cannot minde the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his neighbors. I know very well in like manner, that <hi>England</hi> is full of armed men, but, my Lords, it is not to defend us, nor will Queen <hi>Mary</hi> abandon the ſiege of <hi>London,</hi> which is to put her in poſſeſſion of her Kingdom, to come and oppoſe our enemies. Neither will <hi>Scotland</hi> disfurniſh her ſelf of her men or War, having ſuch mighty Armies at her frontires, wherefore we are not to turn our eyes that way. <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> are too near unto the Turk for to imbroil themſelves with him. And <hi>Sweathland</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> are too far off for any ſuccor to be hoped from thence. At laſt, my Lords, to leave nothing unſaid, the death of <hi>Julius</hi> the third, and of his ſucceſſor, falling out in ſo little a time, permit not his Holineſs, who is not yet well eſtabliſhed, to think of affaires abroad. And to take all hope from you, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> deſiring to conſerve that which they hold in the Archipelaglo, will not break the Treaty they have made with the Turk to ſuccor you. You ſee then, my Lords, that all Chriſtendom doth abandon you, and that there is nothing reſting in you choice, but the burning of your City, and the utter deſtruction of this State, or the return of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Doria.</hi> But to juſtifie the ardor of my Zeal, and to mak it appear, that my fear is not without ground, I do here deliver into your hands the Grand Signiors letter, which it may be will carry you more eaſily to my ſenſe, and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>This oration was heard by the Senate with a great deal of attention, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and joy; and when the Duke had taken the Grand Signiors letter, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an interpreter to come and expound it; in the mean time a confuſed voice aroſe in this Aſſembly, which made <hi>Philippo Spinola</hi> conjecture, that the grace of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> would ſoon be granted: Never was there heart agitated with ſo much violence, and whereas this man was ſenſible and generous, the deſignes of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or puniſhing ſo equally divided his ſoul, as not knowing vvhich ſide to turn him to, hee ſeemed to ſeek for in the eyes of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> vvherevvith to fortifie his reaſon. He vvept all at one inſtant both for grief and tenderneſs, the remembrance of the dead, and the return of the living, excited in his mind, both a calm and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; and in this diſorder of paſſions, and apprehenſions of nature, vvhich combatted
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60144:44"/> one with another, and ſucceſſively deſtroyed themſelves, he was going to be the prey of deſpair and ſorrow, had not the ſight of his Sonne been at length found more powerfull, than the image of his paſt misfortune: He knew ſo diſtinctly the ſenſe of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> by the motions of his face, as being aſhamed to be leſs generous than he, he let his reſentment be ſurmounted by ſo noble an example, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeaſed all the troubles of his ſpirit; ſo that feeling himſelf in a more peaceable eſtate, and ſeeing the Duke about to ſpeak, he to prevent him beſought him with teares in his eyes to reſtore that unto <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> which his proſecutions had taken from him; it being juſt, ſince he had rendred him a ſonne, that he ſhould render him his liberty. This diſcourſe ſo raviſhed the whole Aſſembly, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their cuſtom, and the reſpect of the place, they ſent forth cries of joy, which did not ceaſe very ſoon; but amongſt the reſt the young Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> together with <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who were preſent, thought they ſhould never have been ſilent again; the firſt could not ſufficiently commend this action, and the other could not forbear ſaying, that he was more obliged to his father for vanquiſhing himſelf, than for giving him life. But after every one had praiſed <hi>Philippo</hi> as much as he deſerved, they betook them to their places and gravitie again, for to hearken to the Letter, which the Interpreter expounded in this ſort by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maandment of the Duke.</p>

And whereas it was reſolved that ſome ſhould accompany <hi>Jannetin</hi> who repreſented <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> his Uncle, that was Generaliſſimo, and abſent from <hi>Genoua</hi> at that time, the Count of <hi>Lavagna</hi> would be one of them, that he might renew his acquaintance, for he was not mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Galley ſtill approached, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſayd, that it was not juſt they ſhould ſtay from going to meet thoſe Illuſtrious friends, who came to reſtore him to life, in reſtoring him to his liberty: He commanded them to weigh Anchor, which being preſently executed, they made towards the Galley, that, carryed along with ſayls and oares, reached them in a little ſpace. There it was where <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> felt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary emotion upon the ſight of the young Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> whom the Ambaſſador ſhewed unto him; he whoſe father had alwaies been the protector of his houſe: This ſight gave him a great deal of joy, but mingled with grief, by the remembrance of <hi>Simbaldoes</hi> death: Now as ſoon as his veſſell came cloſe to the Galley, he inſtantly, without attending <hi>Jannetins</hi> order, leaped from the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into her, and after he had complemented with the Delegates of the Senate, he embraced the Count with ſo much teſtimony of affection, as it was eaſie to know, that abſence deſtroyes not a friendſhip, which is ſolidly eſtabliſhed in a generous ſoul; for at the very time when he rejoyced to ſee him, he lamented his fathers death. The Count on his part aſſured him that he would have the ſame reſpect
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60144:45"/> for him as <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> had had; and conjured him to ſhew him the ſame favour. On the other ſide <hi>Doria,</hi> though he were not well ſatisfied with <hi>Andrea</hi> Prince of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi,</hi> nor with <hi>Jannetin</hi> his Nephevv, yet carryed he himſelf curteouſly unto him, and then went and received the civilities of his friends.

As ſoon as they approached to <hi>Genoua,</hi> all the veſſels that were in the Port, having received a commandment to ſhoot off all their Cannon when <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, failed not to ſalute him; the Galley anſwered them with four peeces of Ordnance, and a volley of Musket-ſhot, and the like did all that were on the walls. If one would deſcribe the number of Citizens that were at the Port, the acclamations of joy, the thronging that was there to ſee theſe reſuſcitated men, the tumult that was amongſt them in ſtriving who ſhould come neareſt to their Deliverer, it would almoſt take up a volume that ſhould treat of nothing elſe; it were better then, that amidſt this popular crowd we ſhould conduct <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> to the Senate, followed by the Count of <hi>Lavagna, Jannetin, Doria, Alphonſo,</hi> and all the Commanders of the veſſels, as alſo the ſlave of <hi>Monaco,</hi> whom <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had enjoyned not to budge from him. When firſt they appeared, the Duke out of more than an extraordinary favour advanced to receive him, after which he appointed all the Senators to take their places, and then commanded the Regiſter of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to deface the Sentences which had been pronounced againſt <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and to read the abolition of them, which was conceived in ſuch gentle and advantageous terms, as it plainly appeared, that even their crime deſerved more glory than puniſhment: The reading whereof being ended, the Duke began to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> in the name of the whole Aſſembly, that after they had ſatisfied the pleaſure of <hi>Soliman,</hi> yet held they not themſelves for all that acquitted towards him; that the Senate in generall, and they all in particular, were reſolved not to ſtay there, but to teſtifie unto him with more utility, that they were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the benefits they had received from him; that they deſired him alſo to raze out of his memory, as he was razed out of their Records, the remembrance of the ſentences which had been given againſt him and his friend. To this <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> anſwered, that in baniſhing him they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ad ſatisfied Juſtice, and that in repealing him they had rather ſhewed their clemency than their equity; that the ſervice which he had rendered to the Republique, was not conſiderable, ſeeing he had done it but to ſatisfie his duty; and that alſo, in acknowledgement of the grace it had done him, he ſwore ſolemnly alwaies to hazard both his fortune and life for the intereſt and glory thereof, ſo often as occaſion ſhould preſent it ſelf for it: This ſayd, he turned him to <hi>Philippo Spinola,</hi> and intreated him to pardon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> for his friendſhip towards him, and to beleeve that it could never have found place in his heart, had he not perfectly known during his voyage, that the death of his brother had made him ſhed more tears, than he had loſt bloud; that if his generoſity would permit him utterly to deface out of his mind the reſentment of that unlucky accident; he beſought him to adopt him for his ſonne, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend from him the ſame ſervices, and the ſame obedience, as he could have deſired from him of whom he was ſo unfortunately deprived; but if that contrarily the apprehenſions of Nature did ſtill invite him to revenge, he promiſed to baniſh himſelf voluntarily; and if that were not yet enough, he would ſubmit to the greateſt rigor of Juſtice. <hi>Philippo</hi> was ſo moved with this diſcourſe, as if he had not already ſigned the grace of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> in conſideration of his ſon, he could not have forborn doing it, and embracing him; ſo true it is that vertue hath powerfull charmes for a generous ſoul. That venerable old man anſwered him with teares in his eyes, that he would never oppoſe <hi>Alphonſoes</hi> friendſhip to him; that it was too juſt to be condemned; that owing him his life, and his liberty, he owed him all things; &amp; that not being ſo unreaſonable as to remember an injury, &amp; not remember
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60144:45"/> benefits, he aſſured him that theſe laſt ſhould take from his minde all the bitterneſs of the other; that he would receive him for his ſonne; that he would have all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of a Father for him; and that all the ſatisfaction he deſired of him was, that he would forget his proſecutions, and his hatred, and pardon them to an afflicted Father. There paſt beſides ſo many obliging ſpeeches between them, as all that were preſent had much adoe to retain their teares; but at the laſt the Duke ariſing, all the Aſſembly did the like: Then it was that they imbraced <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> every one ſtriving who ſhould come ſooneſt unto him to teſtifie his joy; after which the Count of <hi>Lavagna</hi> carried him home to his houſe, there to abide till his own was made ready to receive him, for he had been Adminiſtrator of it ever ſince the death of <hi>Sinibaldo,</hi> unto whom the Father of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had left his eſtate to conſerve it for his ſonne; and though all the world beleeved, that <hi>Juſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> was no longer alive, yet had not the Count changed the order of his affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely reſolved not to confer his eſtate upon his heirs, before he vvas cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured that he was dead. As for <hi>Doria,</hi> the Count could not get him to go along with him, though he would have been glad to have paſt the reſt of the day in the company of his friend, but his kinſmen carried him much againſt his will away with them, having firſt conducted <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> as well as all the reſt, to the Counts Palace, where every one departing, except ſome few whom he retained at dinner with <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> he led him to the chamber of <hi>Leonora</hi> his wife, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with a great deal of curteſie, and ſo did <hi>Sophronia, Leonoraes</hi> ſiſter, which was there with her. But as ſoon as civility permitted him to retire, he turned all his thoughts to <hi>Monaco;</hi> and vvhereas he ſaw that the neceſſity of good manners would hold him three or four days at <hi>Genoua</hi> to receive and to return the viſits of his friends, he reſolved to ſend thither the ſame day, the rather for that he judged it fit to underſtand the Princeſſes pleaſure before he went to her; he propoſed his deſign then unto the Count, and deſired him to let him have one of his ſervants for to execute it, and to put into his hands the Princeſſes Officer, whom he had found a ſlave at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Count could not refuſe him ſo juſt a requeſt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him that he vvas to dine firſt: Whilſt they vvere at table their converſation vvas no other than asking <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> queſtions concerning his fortune, vvhereunto he ſtill anſvvered vvith ſo much addreſs, as vvithout ſaying any thing againſt the truth, he diſcovered n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Dinner being done, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> deſired the Count to permit him to go and write in his Cabinet before he was hindered by company, which no doubt would be with him ere it were long. The Count, who was not willing that his own pleaſure ſhould deſtroy that of his friend, opened him the door, and told him, that he was infinitely obliged to the Princeſs of <hi>Monaco,</hi> who, ever after ſhe had power to diſpoſe of her ſelf, had been fought unto by all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> without ſo much as once harkning unto them; but that contrarily ſhe had openly publiſhed, how ſhe had reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world, as ſoon as ſhe certainly knew that he was no longer in it; that ſhe had often had buſineſs at <hi>Genoua,</hi> where her preſence was neceſſary, but would never come thither, ſo much did ſhe fear the fight of them that might condemn her reſolution. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was ſo raviſhed with the conſtancy of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that if the Count had not left him for to return unto the company, this talk had kept
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60144:46"/> him a long time from drawing up his Letter; but in the end after he had written all that which his reſpect, his joy, and his paſſion had inſpired him with, he gave his packet to a Gentleman, whom the Count had aſſigned him for it; he prayed him to go, and come again from <hi>Monaco,</hi> with all the ſpeed that poſſibly he could; and to add moreover to that favour the obſerving the actions of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> at ſuch time as ſhe ſhould underſtand of his return, and that ſhe ſhould ſee him, whom he had ſent her back; that Officer of hers too he careſſed exceedingly, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that he would acknowledge the pains which he had ſuffered for his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had no ſooner ended his diſpatch, but that all the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons of the City came to viſit him, with an extreme impatience to learn from his own mouth the ſucceſs of his adventures. But whilſt he is ſatisfying the curioſity of ſo fair an Aſſembly, and telling them things which vve knovv as vell as he, let us go and content ours at <hi>Monaco,</hi> and ſee with what eye, and in what manner the Princeſs will receive the agreeable newes of her Lovers return. When theſe happy Meſſengers arrived the next day at <hi>Monaco</hi> it was very neer night, ſo that although one of them belonged to the Princeſs, yet was he not knovvn, nor vvould he diſcover himſelf, the better to ſurprize her: It vvas only told then to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that a Gentleman from the Count of <hi>Lavaegna,</hi> and another, vvho vvere nevvly arrived in a Barque, deſired to ſpeak vvith her, and that they had order to deliver their meſſage to none but her ſelf. She vvas at that time in her Cabinet, vvhere ſhe had ſhut up her ſelf that day to read over all the Letters vvhich ſhe had received from <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> ſhe vvas vexed then to be interrupted in an imployment, that made up together both her joy and her grief; ſhe commanded notvvithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they ſhould be brought in: But vvhen ſhe came to knovv him, vvhom ſhe had ſent to ſeek <hi>Iuſtiniano,</hi> ſhe vvas ſo ſurprized, and ſo amazed, out of the opinion ſhe had that his voyage vvas in vain, as the apprehenſion thereof keeping her from ſpeaking, gave the Counts Gentleman opportunity to tell her, that <hi>Iuſtiniano</hi> had given him in charge to preſent her vvith a Letter from him. This diſcourſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived her ſpirits for a vvhile, but fearing ſhe had not underſtood him vvell, ſhe made that agreeable name vvhich touched her heart ſo ſenſibly, to be ſpoken to her once again; vvhereupon the Gentleman told her, that the paper he had preſented to her vvould ſatisfie her better than he could. She caſt her eyes then upon the Letter, vvhich aſſured her that it vvas <hi>Iuſtinianoes</hi> hand, ſo that in an inſtant ſhe abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf over vvholy to joy, and vvith an extreme precipitation broke up the ſeal of the Letter for to read that vvhich follovvs here.</p>

I know well, that the ſuspition which I have had of your fidelity, makes me unworthy of this grace; but I know well alſo, that my cruelleſt enemies have pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for it, and that you have a ſoul too generous not to do as much for a perſon that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily accuſeth himſelfe of a crime, which in my opinion is the greateſt mark of love that ever I have rendred you.

                  <p>Never was there heart more repleniſhed with joy, than that of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> after ſhe had read this Letter; nor ever had an amorous ſpirit ſweeter tranſports, than this Princeſs felt in thus underſtanding all at once the life, the return, and the fidelity of her Lover: But her ſatisfaction augmented yet more, when as ſhe knew in what manner he had been received at <hi>Genoua,</hi> no way doubting now but that her felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſetled for the reſt of her life. After ſhe had ſpent two hours at leaſt in hearing theſe perſons relate unto her what they had known concerning <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> ſhe gave order that they ſhould be very well treated, and that the next morning the Counts Gentleman ſhould repair unto her. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw her ſelf alone, ſhe called a kinſwoman of hers, which lived with her, and not able to contain her joy, ſhe imparted the cauſe of it to her, but in ſuch paſſionate terms, as it was eaſie to perceive, that ſhe lived not ſo much in her ſelf as in <hi>Juſtiniano:</hi> And that ſhe might no longer deferr her anſwer unto him, ſhe cauſed paper and ink to be brought her: but though ſhe had a fertile wit, though ſhe were accuſtomed to expreſs her ſelf very eaſily, and not to have any need to correct her firſt by her ſecond thoughts, yet was it almoſt impoſſible for her to ſatisfie her ſelf in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: She could not conceive that the words of pleaſure, of felicity, and joy, could ſufficient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

She paſſed the night in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thoughts, as albeit ſleep be a ſweet and a mighty enemy, yet could it not for all that ſurpriſe the fair eyes of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſo that as ſoon as the day appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her impatience cauſed her to command the fetching of the Counts Gentleman unto her, hoping that the ſooner he returned, the ſooner ſhe ſhould ſee <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> and to oblige him to make haſt, ſhe ſent him a Diamond worth five hundred Crowns. This liberality failed not to make him diligent; hee came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the Princeſſes Chamber, both to render her thanks, and to receive her commands: ſhee gave him her Letter, and deſired him to preſent her complements to the Count his Maſter, and to aſſure <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> that he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great deal of impatience.

As ſoon as he ſaw this Gentleman, he ſeparated himſelf from the troup for to ſpeak with him, and receive <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> anſwer, which he took with ſuch a panting of his heart, as if he had doubted that it had not been favourable. In the mean time the Count perceiving <hi>Iuſtinianoes</hi> diſorder, cauſed all the company to enter, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring firſt himſelf, ſo that by this addreſs he gave him means to ſteal aſide to read in liberty the Princeſſes letter, which he opened with a great deal of reſpect, and found that it was thus.</p>

This reproach of gallantry obliged him to go in unto them, who all left him a little after, except <hi>Doria,</hi> to give him liberty for to think of his affairs; but whilſt he was ſetling his houſe, the Count ſent him all the money which he had received of his eſtate in his abſence, with order to his Steward to render him an accompt of it. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was ſo amazed, both at his own riches, and the generoſity of his friend, as he had much ado to reſolve to take that which was his own; howbeit fearing to do an outrage to the Count, inſtead of doing him a civility, he received his mony, but would not ſuffer the Steward howſoever to particulariſe any thing of his affairs; telling him only, that provided he could aſſure him he gave him nothing of another bodies, it ſhould ſuffice for the making up of his accompt; that in the mean time to make ſome acknowledgment for the care he had taken to enrich him, he gave him twelve thouſand Crowns.

In the end he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued himſelf in the Galley which had been prepared for him, taking no more with him than his dear <hi>Doria,</hi> and ſome of the Counts people for to ſerve him: He had at that inſtant ſo extraordinary a joy out of the thought that the term of ſo ſhort a navigation ſhould be the ſight of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as it reflected in his face, vvas ſeen in his eyes, appeared in his diſcourſe, ſhevved it ſelf in all his actions; and one would have thought, that he went out of ſlavery in going out of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and that <hi>Monaco</hi> was not only the place of his birth, but that he was attended there to be declared the Conqueror of all Nations, to receive the honor of a Triumph, and to mount into a Throne; that he was alſo expected by the Princeſs for to be crowned, not by the hands of fortune, but by thoſe of love. And whereas he had not ſo much ambition, as deſire to be beloved, the Empire of all the Earth could not have given him a joy ſo ſenſible, as that of the heart of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> This Princeſs imagining right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> would not be long before he came to ſee her, had given order at the Port, that as ſoon as a Galley ſhould be diſcovered from <hi>Genoua</hi>-ward, ſhe ſhould be advertiſed of it, being perſwaded that they would not let <hi>Iuſtiniano</hi> come in a Feluca; ſo that when he appeared, notice was thereof given the Princeſs, and at the ſame inſtant all the wall was ſet on fire with a valley of Muſquet ſhot; all the great Ordnance likewiſe was diſcharged, the dreadfull noiſe whereof could not keep <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> from being pleaſingly aſſured, that thoſe flames were an effect of them which love had kindled in the heart of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who preſently diſpatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the principall of her ſervants, and the moſt conſiderable of the Inhabitants of <hi>Monaco,</hi> to go to receive him, and preſent him with the keyes of the Town-Gates. This obliging ceremony ſo mightily ſurpriſed <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> when it was done unto him, that he could hardly finde terms to expreſs his reſentment thereof, and the confuſion whereinto this ſo gallant and extraordinary a favour had put his ſpirit. He beſought thoſe that were ſent from <hi>Iſabella</hi> to excuſe him, if he did not accept of that which they offered him, ſince it would not be juſt, that he, who would hold himſelf too much honoured to be their Princeſſes ſubject, ſhould do an act of their Soveraign; that for the incivility which he committed in refuſing a thing that came from her, he conjured them to conduct him where ſhe was, that he might give her thanks, and crave pardon of her both at once. They were a pretty while in this diſpute of curteſie on either ſide; but at laſt <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> remained firm in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. They began then to take that winding way which leads to the Town, and where all the ſouldiers of the Garriſon vvere ranged into tvvo files for him to paſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60144:48"/> thorough the midſt of them, and ſo he marched till he came to the Portall of the Caſtle, where the Princeſs attended him. When as firſt he appeared ſhe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to receive him, ſo that to ſave her ſome ſtepps, and to follow his inclination, he went as faſt as poſſibly he could, and kiſſed her roab. It was at this inſtant that thoſe perfect Lovers felt that which cannot be expreſt; and albeit they had reſolved on both parts to contain themſelves, and had alſo prepared their minds for the making of ſome complement to one another in this incounter, their ſilence, and then their interrupted diſcourſes, made it apparent to all that beheld them, that exceſs of pleaſure excited ſuch a trouble in their ſoules, as would not permit them to expreſs all that they thought; but to conceal this agreeable tranſport from the eyes of her ſubjects, the Princeſs cauſed <hi>Iuſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> to enter, after ſhe had ſaluted <hi>Doria</hi> with a great deal of civility: When they were arrived at <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> chamber, all that had accompanied them were obliged by reſpect to withdraw, two or three excepted, which remained to entertain <hi>Doria,</hi> whilſt the Princeſs talked with <hi>Juſtiniano.</hi> Never were two hearts repleniſhed with ſo much joy; never had two ſpirits more charming tranſports; and never did two amorous perſons ſo perfectly expreſs the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their ſoules by their onely lookes; they ſaid both of them together, and at one inſtant, that they had alwaies loved one onother; that they ſtill loved one another; and that they would love one another eternally: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this dumb language had made all their apprehenſions to paſs from one heart to another, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> began to render the Princeſs thanks for all her goodneſs towards him; but ſhe, not able to ſuffer the continuance of this diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to remember, that their intereſts could not be ſeparated, and that owing him all things it was unjuſt to thank her; eſpecially having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, than what ſhe could not chuſe but doe; namely to weep for his abſence, to fear his changing, to apprehend his loſs, and to renounce all the pleaſures of this life, ſince ſhe could not have that of ſeeing him. <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano</hi> anſwered thereunto, that this neceſſity, which ſhe had impoſed upon her ſelf, was ſo fair a mark of her affection, and ſo glorious for him, that unleſs he ſhould be the moſt ingratefull of men, he was obliged to thank her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; As for the reſt, her teares being of ſo ineſtimable a price, ſhe muſt not find it ſtrange, if being unable to render her any ſervice that could merit that honor, he reſolved at leaſt to tell her often, that he knew well he was unwor- of it. This converſation was interrupted by the Sergeant-major of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, who according to the commandment which the Princeſs had given him for it, came to demand the word of <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> this Gallanterie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed him as pleaſingly, as the former which had been done him upon his landing at the Port; and as he was no leſs civill, than <hi>Jſabella</hi> was obliging, he ſaid unto her with a low voice, and beholding her with eyes full of love, and reſpect, that a man, who knew not how to rule his deſires, and that would die her Slave, was not in a ſtate to command others: But what reaſon ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he could allege, he muſt obey <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> pleaſure; yet was it not for all that but upon condition, that ſhe ſhould give the word as well as he, and that he ſhould not, but after her, finiſh this myſterie of Warre, which at this time was abſolutely guided by love. For as if theſe two illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had agreed together about this gallanterie, the word, which the Princeſs gave to the Sergeant-major, was found to be <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> and that which <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> gave, after he had long refuſed to doe it, was the fair name of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi> This conformitie of ſpirit and thought was equally pleaſing unto them; for though they knew not what each of them had ſaid, yet did they underſtand it by a complement between them; for <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> aſſured the Princeſs, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger her curteſie <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould reign ſtill at <hi>Monaco;</hi> and the Princeſs aſſured him, that manger his modeſty and reſiſtance <hi>Iuſtiniano</hi> was Maſter of the Town. One part of the evening was ſpent in a ſumptuous feaſt, which <hi>Iſabella</hi> made
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60144:48"/> him in the great Hall of the Caſtle; and for the reſt of it all their converſation was nothing but promiſes of loving one another eternally; and joy poſſeſt them in ſuch ſort, as there came not ſo much as one thought unto them of their misfortunes. But whereas it was late, <hi>Iuſtiniano</hi> lead the Princeſs back to her chamber, followed by <hi>Aemilia</hi> her kinſwoman, and all her women; as for him he was conducted by the Officers of <hi>Iſabella</hi> to a lodging, which ſhe had cauſed to be prepared for him, and where the riches of the furniture made it appear, that ſhe had omitted nothing for the receiving of him magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently. The image of <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſo fully poſſeſſed his mind, as that of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> never came into his thought; the remembrance of what was paſt, nor the fear of that to come, could not trouble his pleaſures; and his preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo inchanted his reaſon, as without conſidering that this ſupreme feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, occaſioned by the ſight of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> would precipitate him ere long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an extreme misfortune, he paſt the night without any other unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than that which he received by the impatience he was in to ſee day, that he might ſee <hi>Iſabella</hi> again. <hi>Doria</hi> was alſo conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chamber which was little leſs ſtately than that of his Illuſtrious friend, who to entertain himſelf more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly in his amorous fancies had deſired to lie alone.</p>

This match being made, this fair Troop, as ſoon as dinner was done, began their walk; <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> lent <hi>Iſabella</hi> his hand for to ſupport her down to the Garden, whither one may eaſily go on foot, <hi>Doria</hi> did the like to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and the reſt of the women together with the Princeſſes chiefeſt Officers followed after.

                  <p>THe cauſe of all my miſeries being a crime which you have pardoned, I think you will have ſo much goodneſs as not to oblige me to confeſs once more unto you, that which I have written to you heretofore: I will not tell you then how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had by an hundred apparent reaſons confirmed my ſelf in the belief that you lived no longer but for the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> deſpair ſeized ſo ſtrongly on my ſpirit, that death was the term of all my deſires; but to get far away ſpeedily from a place, where I could ſuſpect the moſt conſtant perſon that ever was of infidelity, ſuffer me to tell you in few words, that quitting <hi>Germany,</hi> I imbarqued my ſelf on the Baltique Sea, to ſeek out an honourable death in the war of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that on the way I was taken priſoner by <hi>Chairadin</hi> King of <hi>Algier,</hi> who ſold me ſoon after to the Baſſa <hi>Sinan,</hi> which cauſed me inſtantly to be conducted to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with three hundred other Slaves, whereof he meant to make a preſent to the Grand Signior. It is in that place, Madam, where fortune hath done ſuch ſtrange, and ſo unlikely things, as albeit they arrived unto me, yet do I doubt many times, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my adventures, whether it be not an effect of my depraved imagination that repreſents them ſo unto me, or a faithfull report of my memory; but not to loſe time in exagerating the phantaſticalneſs of fortune, which hath been but too well known by all Ages, and all Nations, and to give you an extraordinary proof of it in my perſon, you ſhall underſtand, that after I was come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> laden with irons, as well as my companions, without any difference betwixt us, but that they tried every day to break their chains, and that I bore mine with a tranquillity of minde, yet melancholick withall, which made them perceive that life and liberty were not the object of my deſires; this knowledge which they had of my apprehenſions during the voyage, was the cauſe that they concealed from me the reſolution they had taken, when we were come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of killing their Guard, that ſo they might ſave themſelves ere they ſhould be preſented to the Grand Signior; and they carried their deſign ſo well, as it was not diſcovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two hours before it ſhould have been executed. And whereas amongſt the Turks the deſire of liberty is a capitall crime in a Slave, unleſs it be in paying a ranſom for it, this enterprize being proved againſt them, the Baſſa <hi>Sinan,</hi> a violent man, and that ſaw how in one only night he was like to have loſt three hundred Slaves, without examining the circumſtances of the matter, without diſtinguiſhing the guilty from the innocent, condemned us all to be expoſed to the cruelleſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of that Countrey. This Sentence was received diverſly, according to the diverſity of minds, but at laſt, though there were ſome generous ſouldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt that great number of Slaves, yet heard they all this wofull news with grief: As for me, who did not deſire to live longer, becauſe I ſaw my ſelf conſtrained to live without you, I beheld the end of my life as an aſſured port to ſhelter me from all the ſtorms wherewith I was agitated; ſo that though it had been eaſie for me to have exempted my ſelf from this perill, by letting the Baſſa know what ranſom I could have paid him, yet had I no purpoſe ſo to do. Howbeit this generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation indured not long, for the Baſſa <hi>Sinan</hi> comming to conſider that he could not ſatisfie his revenge and his avarice both together, reſolved not to loſe that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which others would have taken from him; and therefore for examples ſake only, he commanded that we ſhould draw lots, and that the tenth part of our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould expiate the crime of the reſt. This grace was received with joy by all the company; and albeit fear had ſtill ſome place in their ſouls, yet was hope the povverfuller, and perſwaded them all in particular, that the misfortune ſhould not fall upon them: In the mean time the lots were drawn, and chance having decided the matter, I was of the number of the thirty that were to die. It was then that I well obſerved, how human weakneſs is the cauſe why every one is in ſome ſort comforted by having companions in his miſery; for when we were all condemned, I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60144:50"/> ſaw nothing but tears of ſorrow, but as ſoon as the lot had ſeparated the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate from the infortunate, theſe laſt changed their ſorrow into rage, and cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler ſo tranſported them, as they could not endure the ſight of them that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: Yet was it not they whom deſtiny reſerved for this ſupreme diſgrace; for the Baſſa having moderated his fury, would have our lives once more depend ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely upon the caprichiouſneſs of fortune; he ordained then, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>t of thirty which we were, no more than three ſhould ſuffer; and the lot ſo favoured the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I had to die, that I was one of thoſe unhappy men, according to the ſenſe of others, though in mine own heart I was of a contrary opinion. The two that proved my companions in this ſad adventure, were without doubt the worthieſt of all the ſlaves, they were young, handſom, and courageous, and even ſuch as the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners themſelves, who were to take away our lives, had ſome regreet to ſee, that chance had made a choice ſo unjuſt according to their thinking, ſo that one of them moved with compaſſion, went and advertiſed the Baſſa, that in loſing us he would loſe the propereſt ſlaves that were in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the fitteſt to make a preſent of to his Highneſs. The Baſſa, who repented him already of his violence, in regard of his own intereſt, and yet deſired that ſome one of us ſhould be puniſhed, reſolved at length for the laſt caſt, that of we three but one ſhould dye, and that according to the firſt order, chance ſhould ſtill be the abſolute maſter of our life or of our death. The lot was not more favourable to me in this laſt incounter, than in all the former, and I was the ſacrifice deſtined for the publique ſ fety; I was then preſently bound more ſtraitly than before; they made me my ſelf carry the preparations of my puniſhment; and without boaſting I can avow, that I faced death with tranquillity enough: I dare not almoſt ſay, that in this wofull eſtate you were the only object of my thought, yet it is true how I imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that this obſtinacy of fortune, in chuſing me ſtill to be ſacrifiſed, was an effect of your deſire, and that ſhe did not judge me unworthy to live, but becauſe you judged me unworthy of your affection. In the end I received this ſentence, as if it had been pronounced by you, and in that thought I went to my puniſhment with ſo much reſolution, as bred wonder and compaſſion in them that beheld me. As for my ſelf, I was far from being afflicted at mine own proper miſeries; I had ſome delight in my fetters and chains; and the very ſight of death could not keep me from having ſome happy moments; for my love, doing its laſt and uttermoſt indeavour, in following me to the grave, perſwaded me, that if you had ſeen the ſame <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> upon whom at other times you had accumulated glory, be ready to yeeld up the ghoſt in adoring you, with the moſt cruell torments that the rage of tyrants hath ever invented, you would at leaſtwiſe have breathed forth ſome ſighs, and ſhed ſome tears. The Princeſs, not able to endure that he ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue this diſcourſe any longer, ſo much trouble did this deadly image excite in her ſoul, aſſured him with a great deal of tenderneſs, and her eyes full of tears, that this narration touched her ſo ſenſibly, as albeit ſhe could not doubt but that he had eſcaped this perill, yet could ſhe not chuſe but be in fear for him, and feel ſuch a grief in her mind, as ſhe was not able to expreſs. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was no leſs moved with the tears of the Princeſs, than ſhe had been by his relation; and when he had rendred her thanks for ſo generous an apprehenſion, <hi>Doria</hi> told him, that he could not better acquit himſelf of that devoire, than to acquaint her by what inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he got out of this adventure. <hi>Iſabella</hi> having teſtified by her action, that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaes</hi> impatience was hers, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> proſecuted his Hiſtory in this manner. Since your Excellency will know how I was delivered, I am to let you underſtand, that to go from the place where my doom had been pronounced, to that where it was to be executed, we were of neceſſity to paſs by one of the faces of the Seraglio, and my good luck would have it, that when we came to that part, the Sultana <hi>Aſteria,</hi> great <hi>Solimans</hi> daughter, was leaning at a window, whereof ſhe had pulled up the grate, and ſeeing a far off the multitude of people which accompanyed me, and who ſeemed by their carriage to take part with my misfortune, it chanced that ſhe caſt her eye upon my face, and that ſhe found ſomething in it which begot a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60144:50"/> in her, whereupon ſhe commanded them that conducted me to ſtay, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them what crime I had committed; I knew afterwards (for then I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the language very well) that one amongſt them told her I was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and recounted unto her by what miſhap I was in that eſtate, by aggravating with a great deal of vehemency the obſtinacy of fortune in chuſing me ſtill, and the conſtancy which I had ſhewed in this encounter. As long as this diſcourſe laſted I obſerved that ſhe conſidered me very attentively, ſo that perceiving by ſome words which I had already learned during the voyage, and by her geſture, that ſhe ſpake of me, and that ſhe pittied me, I ſaluted her with a profound reſpect. At length, Madam, the young Sultana <hi>Aſteria</hi> was ſo compaſſionate and generous, that after ſhe had asked, and knew of what Nation I was, ſhe expreſly charged them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me, not to ſtir from thence till they had order from the Grand Signior her father. They, who knew both the rank and credit, which the Sultana had with <hi>Soliman,</hi> were carefull not to fail in obeying her; in the mean time ſhe went to the Emperor her father, who was then very luckily in the old Seraglio, where ſhe was, and which is not inhabited but by the Mothers, Siſters, Daughters, and Aunts of the Grand Signior: There ſhe beſought him to grant her the life of a ſlave, that was an Italian, and innocent, whom the Baſſa <hi>Sinan</hi> had purpoſed to have preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but novv vvould put him to death onely to ſerve for an example. After ſhe had obtained the effect of her prayer, ſhe reſted not there, for ſhe reported ſo many things of my conſtancy and reſolution to <hi>Soliman,</hi> as it begot a deſire in him to ſee me; ſo that ſending a command to deliver me, I received order by a Truche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to go unto the Grand Signior. To tell you, Madam, what this change wrought in me would be to no end, ſince it is eaſie for you to judge, that he, who ſo much deſpiſed life, received it not with much joy; and I dare ſay, that I ſtood in more need of conſtancy to reſolve to live, than another would have had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to die: Howbeit I went to his Highneſs, and whatſoever averſion I had from life, yet did I not forbear rendring him thanks for granting it to me. When firſt I appeared before <hi>Soliman</hi> he began to ſpeak to me; for whereas he knew before that I was of <hi>Italy,</hi> he beleeved that I would underſtand a language, which at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> they call the <hi>Franks</hi> toung, and ſpoken there by every one for the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of commerce, and which alſo I underſtood perfectly, becauſe it is no other than a corrupted Italian. It was not, for that this Prince, out of an extraordinary curioſity proper to thoſe of his Nation, is not acquainted, not onely with all the <hi>Orientall</hi> tongues, but with the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Italian;</hi> howbeit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he doth not exerciſe them, he underſtands them only, without being able to ſpeak them with facilitie: nevertheleſs I muſt for the preſent except the laſt, which in conſideration of me he learned afterwards very perfectly. It was then in that language, wherof I have ſpoken, that he demanded of me whence I was, what vvas my birth and profeſſion, and by what adventure I came into the power of the Baſſa <hi>Sinan.</hi> I anſwered him that I was a poor <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman, whoſe life had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable enough wherewith to entertain ſo great a Prince; and that the only chance of War had made me a ſlave at <hi>Argier,</hi> where the Baſſa had bought me not long after. I confeſs I had ſomewhat ado to diſguiſe the truth, but being reſolved that I would never be heard ſpoken of more, I did not tell what I was, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Soliman</hi> told me then, that I had ſomething in the air of my face, that ſhewed me greater than I had delivered my ſelf to be, and that all the rules of phyſiognomy were falſe, or I had not ſpoken ſincerely unto him. I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this diſcourſe with a great deal of reſpect and modeſty; after which he talked to me of the cuſtoms of my country, of war, of fortifications, and when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by my anſwers that I was not abſolutely ignorant, though in this occaſion I was not forward to ſhew my ſelf very knowing, or of any great wit; there is not any good art, or excellent ſcience, which he did not diſcourſe with me about, for the ſpace of two hours that I had the honour to be with him. At laſt, Madam, this great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60144:51"/> Prince was ſo ſatisfied of me, as he ſent word to the Baſſa <hi>Sinan,</hi> that having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood he meant to preſent me unto him with three hundred ſlaves, he remitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him not only his three hundred ſlaves, but aſſured him that he would give him alſo as many more for a recompence of the ſervice he had done him, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me under his obedience: And when he had ordained that care ſhould be taken of me, he did me the grace to tell me, that I had ſo neerly touched his inclination, as after he had given me my life, he would have given me me my liberty too, if he could have reſolved to deprive himſelf ſo ſoon of a perſon, which was agreeable to him. I muſt confeſs that this generoſity came near my heart, and that I was almoſt aſhamed to receive ſo extraordinary a favour with ſo little teſtimony of joy; I retired then infinitely ſatisfied of this Prince, and I was conducted to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Slaves that were deſtined to his Highneſs, although I was not treated like them, having no other pain than that of wearing my irons.

It cannot indure mediocritie in my happineſs, nor in my unhappineſs; and out of an obſtinate rage to perſecute me, when it ſees that I am reſolved for the greateſt misfortunes, and that death paſſeth with me for a ſoveraign good, it withdrawes me from that Port, which I held to be moſt ſecure, to expoſe me to the tempeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by apparent felicities: But it may be too (ſaid I further ſighing) that there is ſome juſtice in its crueltie; the temerity which I have had to love, and to hope to be beloved of the moſt admirable perſon that ever will be, is not yet ſufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uniſhed; grief, deſpair, exile, impriſonment, and certainty of death, are not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proportionable enough to my crime, which being infinite, demands alſo an eternall chaſtiſement: Let us ſuffer then (continued I) ſince the incomparable <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> is not ſatisfied, and let us accept of the life, which is given us for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not for a grace. It was after this manner, Madam, that I reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all that fortune prepared for me, with a deſign no longer to oppoſe my reaſon againſt her humors, and blindly, and without reſiſtance, to obey this inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, which mocks all human prudence; which puts us into the Port upon the point of ſuffring ſhipwrack; which precipitates us from the top of happineſs into the abyſme of miſery; which overturnes Thrones; which deſtroyes King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; which cauſes Kings to die; and to ſay all in a word, which ſoveraignly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the whole Univerſe. This reſolution being ſtrongly eſtabliſhed in my mind, I found more tranquillity in my ſelf; and though I was alwaies infinitely ſad, yet for all that it is certain, that my melancholy was more ſociable; and to ſpeak truth, it was in ſome ſort neceſſary that I ſhould find my ſelf in this eſtate; for <hi>Soliman</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to ſend for me the next day to talk with him; and this ſecond converſation having ſatisfied him more than the firſt, there paſt not a day after that, wherein I had not the honor to confer with him: Hiſtory, War, Geography, the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, Painting, and Muſick were the ſubject of theſe entertainments: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Prince loves the Sciences paſſionately, and that the Orientall people are not at this day adicted to them, he was raviſhed to ſee that one of his Slaves was not ignorant in all theſe things; ſo that I may ſay with truth, that there was not a man in all his Empire, whom he eſteemed more than my ſelf. In the mean time I am to let your Excellencie underſtand, ſince you will know all my fortune, that in <hi>Galatia,</hi> in the ſame place where was heretofore <hi>Angori,</hi> which the Antients called <hi>Seuleucia,</hi> and which the Turkes at this preſent name <hi>Gielas-il,</hi> by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpeech, there is an infinite multitude of <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religious men, called <hi>Deruiſtars,</hi> comprehending under that name all the divers kinds of thoſe Solitaries, which are found amongſt them; but amongſt the reſt there are of them, which are termed <hi>Calenders,</hi> who are of a different ſect from the <hi>Deruis,</hi> and that make a more particular profeſſion of continencie and auſteritie: Of the number of theſe <hi>Calenders</hi> was one <hi>Zellebis,</hi> that is to ſay, a Noble man, deſcended from <hi>Chaz-Bectas,</hi> or <hi>Chaz-Haſſen,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Orchan,</hi> ſecond Emperor of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60144:51"/> Turkes, and that in his religion had been the Diſciple and Sectarie of one <hi>Edebal,</hi> who was the firſt inſtitutor of all thoſe <hi>Mahometan</hi> devotions, which propheſied the Empire to <hi>Othoman,</hi> and his ſucceſſors; and who in his time had been held for a man of a very holy life: So that this <hi>Calender Zellebis,</hi> of whom I ſpeak, a ſtirring and active man, relying on the reputation of his Predeceſſors, began to gain unto him all thoſe of his ſect, which were no ſmall number; and under the name and pretext of liberty, he made almoſt all <hi>Natolia</hi> to revolt. <hi>Soliman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed thereof, failed not in ſending a mighty Army thither; but the chance of War ſo favoured thoſe revolters, as they defeated it in divers incounters, and alſo killed ſome Sangiaes, or Governors of Provinces, who would have oppoſed themſelves to this ſedition, which under the pretext of the ſanctity of thoſe that raiſed it, might at length have proved dangerous to the Turkiſh Empire. The news of the laſt defeat of the Grand-Signiors Troopes was brought him a little while after I had the honor to belong unto him: And whereas the bad ſucceſs of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill War touched him more vively, than the loſs of a battel in a ſtrange War would have done, he reſolved to go in perſon to puniſh theſe rebells. And whereas he did not believe, that theſe ſeditious were ſo daring, as to oppoſe him, he gave not himſelf the time to raiſe one of thoſe puiſſant Armies, which ſtrikes terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the word, but contented himſelf with joyning his ordinary Guard, and ſome other Troops, which he took out of the Gariſons, whereby he paſſed to thoſe that had rallied themſelves together after the laſt defeat. When he was ready to depart, he commanded me to follow him, though none of the reſt of the Slaves beſides had order to go: I will not tell you, Madam, all the particulars of this War; for whereas I recount mine own Hiſtory, and not that of the Grand-Signior, I am to ſpeak onely of thoſe things, wherein I have ſome intereſt: You ſhall underſtand then, that <hi>Zellebis,</hi> the Chief of this ſedition, being fallen ſick, had forſaken the Camp, and was retired into the Capitall City of <hi>Natolia,</hi> with the beſt Troops of his Army; whereof <hi>Soliman</hi> having been advertiſed, he reſolved to go and beſiege him; not doubting but if he could get him into his hands he ſhould eaſily prevail over all the reſt. This deſign, having been approved of, was not long before it was executed; we marched directly to this City; approches to it are made; trenches are caſt up; batteries are raiſed; and in a few daies the avenues to it are ſo well cloſed up, as it is impoſſible for any body to goe in or out. At length, to abridge this narration, <hi>Zellebis,</hi> being in a ſhort time recovered, defended himſelf ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly, that after he had ſuſtained three aſſaults with great loſs of ours, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged were ſtill in caſe to make ſallies every day, which extremely incommodated our Army. During all theſe paſſages I had divers times beſought his Highneſs to permit me to venture my life for his ſervice, which I could not obtain, becauſe a Slave is not ſuffred to bear armes: I lived then in this ſort with a great deal of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to ſee my ſelf in a ſhamefull idleneſs at ſuch a time, when as occaſions were ſo often preſented, wherein I might have dyed Nobly. As I was in this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Grand-Signior, being much incenſed to ſee this Town hold out ſo long, reſolved that his Army ſhould periſh there, or carry it by force; and for that effect he cauſed a generall aſſault to be given: And though there were a body of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army in the field, he commanded nevertheleſs that they ſhould not care ſo much for the guard of the Trenches, as for the attacquing of the place; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this was, becauſe the enemy had never appeared, nor had uſed indeavour, either to caſt Troops into the City, or to raiſe the ſiege. In the mean time it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that an hour after the aſſault was begun, and that above twenty times there had been already loſt, and regained, five or ſix foot of ground, which was to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Soliman</hi> Maſter of the Town, there was heard, notwithſtanding the dreadfull noiſe of Cannons, of armes, and of the cries of them that fought, towards the Grand-Signiors quarter a great volley of musket ſhot, which put much fear into our ſouldiers hearts. <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was preſent at this fight for to give direction in perſon, confirmed them the beſt that poſſibly he could, and after he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Baſſa <hi>Sinan</hi> to continue the aſſault, he went to ſee what the matter was,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60144:52"/> followed only by two thouſand Janiſaries, but he was quickly cleared in it, for he had not marched fifty paces, but that he ſaw the reſt of his ſouldiers come in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, having avoided the fury of the enemy, who was purſuing them ſtill. <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> no longer doubted then but that this was <hi>Zellebis</hi> his Army which attacqued his Camp; and being a Prince of a great and generous ſpirit, he purpoſed to fight with them: But as he was ready to march directly to the enemy, he was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to behold from the Towns ſide, that not only his ſouldiers had abandoned the aſſault, but that <hi>Zellebis</hi> in the head of thoſe of <hi>Chientaya,</hi> went beating them before him in a terrible diſorder. As for me, who always followed the Prince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other arms than a light chain, which I wore on one of my legs, I aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he was loſt, as indeed without almoſt a ſupernaturall aſſiſtance it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he could not have eſcaped: He was cloſed up in the midſt of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his Army was diſperſed, fear had ſeized upon his Troops, and if an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious plot of ground had not been met withall to put part of his Forces, and his Perſon in ſafety, this miſchief had been without remedy. But, Madam, muſt I tell you how it was by my means, that this day, ſo unlucky in the beginning, had a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end? Yes, Madam, I muſt tell it you, and ſince my valor was but an effect of my deſpair, and that you were the cauſe thereof, it is juſt to let you underſtand how it was by you that I ſaved both the life, and the glory of great <hi>Soliman.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then, if you pleaſe, this verity in the proceſs of this Narration, to the end I may not be accuſed of vanity in delivering things which I had not executed without you: I ſhall tell you then, Madam, that in this univerſall diſorder I conſerved ſo much judgement to obſerve, that on the left hand of that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where we were, there was a place which Nature had ſo well fortified, as with very little defence it was impoſſible to be forced; I advanced then boldly to the Grand Signior, and maugre the preſs I let him ſee what I had already noted, and cauſed him to perceive, that in attending the rallying of his troops he might be there not only in aſſurance, but in an eſtate to keep thoſe of the town from joyning with them that were without. This advice having ſatisfied him, he commanded to go and ſeiz on that plot; but as if the enemy had been acquainted with this deſign he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to diſpute it with us. There it was, Madam, that I ceaſed to be ſlave for to be a ſoldier, for having taken a ſcimitar which I found amongſt the dead bodies, I got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head of our troops, with ſo much reſolution, &amp; ſo much good fortune, as I did things there which I dare not relate: in the end, Madam, I inſpired our ſoldiers with ſuch valor, as reaſuming courage we repulſed the enemy, &amp; ſeized on the place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have already ſpoken to you. But when I ſaw <hi>Soliman</hi> in ſafety, I went and caſt my ſelf amidſt ſome of our forces, which were fighting ſtill with thoſe that were come out of the City; and perceiving that our ſouldiers were preparing to flie, in hope to get to the place where <hi>Soliman</hi> was, I threatned to kill them if they returned not to the fight: This ſo extraordinary a diſcourſe being ſeconded by ſome effects, which ſeemed marvellous unto them, they reſolved to follow me: Behold me then the head of this couragious Brigade, whom I conducted ſo fortunately, as I made them carry that in two hours, which a whole Army could not do in ſix weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. At laſt, Madam, being reſolved to periſh, or do ſome great matter, I ſo hotly purſued the enemies, that after we had killed a great number of them, made the reſt to flie, and put fear into all the remainder, I drove them even into their town, where being entred alone with them, certainly I performed things, which made me plainly ſee, that deſpair is more powerfuller than valor; but whatſoever I could have done, doubtleſs I ſhould have fallen there if I had not called to minde, that the breach being abandoned, I might through that place cauſe our forces to enter; thither I made then with extreme ſpeed, and finding none on the Ramparts but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed people, who were there aſſembled to ſee the ſucceſs of the buſineſs, I eaſily got to it, and preſently diſcovering thoſe which had followed me to the City-gate, I cried unto them, Victory, Victory, for to oblige them to turn head towards me: When as they knew me by my ſlaves habit, they were ſo ſurprized to ſee me ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as no way doubting but that I was a man ſent by their Prophet to ſuccour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60144:52"/> them, they reſolved to abandon me no more; and ſuperſtition mingled it ſelf ſo happily amongſt them to excite their valor, as I can ſay that I never ſaw ſouldiers more couragious: They came then unto me with incredible ſpeed, and were no ſooner mounted on the breach but I pulled down an Enſign, which the enemies had ſet up on the wall, to put one of <hi>Solimans</hi> in the place of it; and having left ſome for the guard of the breach, I went with the reſt to ſeize on the gates of the town, and their Magazine of Arms. The people no ſooner heard long-live victorious <hi>Soliman</hi> cried in the ſtreets, but their weapons ſell out of their hands, aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that their Army was defeated, and that the Emperors was in the City: In the mean time <hi>Zellebis</hi> uſed all his endeavour to put heart into his ſouldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but ſeeing it altogether impoſſible, he reſolved to flie, fearing nothing ſo much as to fall alive into <hi>Solimans</hi> hands. As ſoon as the people knew that their Defendor had forſaken them, we had no further reſiſtance, except at the Gates, where ſome ſouldiers were ſtill in the guard of them; this obſtacle ſtayed us not long, for whereas we fought then with hope that the victory vvould fall to the juſter ſide, vve redoubled our efforts vvith ſo much ardour, as at laſt vve became Maſters of the place. Things being in this eſtate, and perceiving that I had not force enough to keep the people under, I thought fit to advertiſe <hi>Soliman</hi> of it, vvho in the mean vvhile had rallied one part of his Army, vvhich at length proved ſtrong enough to vvithſtand the Enemy, but not to repulſe him, had not the happy nevvs vvhich I ſent them redoubled their courage: <hi>Soliman</hi> cauſed the taking of the City then to be preſently publiſhed amongſt the Troops, and promiſed them the pillage of it if they performed their duty vvell. After this, Madam, they marched vvith a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, vvhich certainly vvas a preſage of the victory had the enemies ſtood to it, but having turned their eyes to the City, and ſeeing on the walls an Enſign with the Arms of the Empire in it, their courage began to abate, and ſoon after to give place unto fear; for <hi>Zellebis</hi> upon his flying away had ſent them word, that they ſhould not hazzard a Battell, for that the Town was loſt, ſo that they retired; and although that <hi>Soliman</hi> purſued them a while, their Chieftain was ſo cunning in his Trade, as it was impoſſible to ingage them in the fight, or to keep them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an honourable retreat; for <hi>Soliman</hi> beholding from an eminent place, that they were going to take a wood, where it would have been dangerous to purſue them, and ſeeing likewiſe that it was almoſt night, he returned to the Camp: And whereas he had already ſent me troops enough, that I might no longer fear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of this people, I went to aſſure him that I had taken ſuch order, as he might by the breach enter into this rebellious Town. To tell you, Madam, how this Prince received me would be an impoſſible thing; he careſſed me with ſo much goodneſs, he commended me ſo highly, and ſaid ſo many times that he owed both his life and his honour unto me, as his praiſe far ſurpaſſed that which I had done: And obſerving that I had ſtill a piece of the chain on, which I had brought back with me, from the fight, he commanded it inſtantly to be taken off. But ſeeing that he could not forbear ſpeaking of me, and always asking me ſome particularity of this action, I beſought him to think rather of conſerving that which fortune had given him by my hand, than any further to commend a victory, for which he was more ingaged to his own good hap, than to my valour. This Prince grew ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſilent hereupon, whereof I could not imagine the cauſe; but I was not long in this uncertainty, for <hi>Soliman</hi> after he had muſed a little, began to ſpeak, and tell me, how he was much troubled that his Religion would not permit him to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny command to ſuch a man as I was, and that it forced him to do an injuſtice, and to ſhew himſelf ingratefull, by conferring that on another which I had acquired. I beſought him then to believe, that if his Highneſs was ſatisfied, ſo was I, and that I aſpired to no other glory than that of pleaſing and ſerving him. He appointed the <hi>Saniac</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi> then to go and command in the Town; and leſt the fear of chaſtiſement ſhould carry the Inhabitants to any revolt, he charged him to keep the ſouldiers all night in Arms, and he ordained the ſame in his Camp, the Enemies not being ſo far off, but that it might be feared they might make uſe of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60144:53"/> which the obſcurity of the night gave them to come and beat up ſome of our Quarters. After this he made a ſign for every one to withdraw; I would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed like the reſt, but he let me know that this Commandment extended not to me, and that he deſired I ſhould ſtay with him. It was then, Madam, that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſurmounted my inſenſibility, by forcing me to begin to ſerve him with amity, and not with a ſimple acknowledgement, as I had done before; and indeed to ſpeak truth, one muſt have renounced all reaſon not to have been moved with ſo much generoſity. He intreated me not as his Slave; he ſpake not to me as to his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; he careſſed me not as his equall, but as if I had been an hundred degrees above him, both in my birth, in my merit, and in my valour: And to teſtifie unto me that this diſcourſe was not a flattery wherewith he meant to recompence me, he ſware to me that it would be long of me if I did not reign in his Empire as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely as he himſelf, and conjured me to furniſh him with the means for it, becauſe without me he ſhould be conſtrained to be ingratefull, fortune being ſo much his enemy, as he could not do good to the only man he loved, if I were not willing to it alſo. At laſt, Madam, after an hundred of the moſt conjuring proteſtations that can be imagined, and after he had prayed me above an hundred times not to think ill of him for the propoſition he was going to make me, he undertook to perſwade me to quit my Religion for to imbrace his, becauſe, ſaid he, without that he muſt be ingratefull, I muſt be a ſlave, and he muſt likewiſe be the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy of men, there not being a more cruell adventure (continued he) for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Prince, than not to be able to recompence a gallant action, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to leave a perſon in ſervitude whom he loves, and whom he eſteems ſo much, as to divide his Empire with him. After that this Prince had ſaid all that generoſity and affection could make one to ſay in a like encounter, I beſought him not to afflict himſelf unjuſtly, ſince I was going to give him the means to recompence me, not only for the ſervices I had rendred him, but for all thoſe which I ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in time to come. Hereupon ſuch a joy appeared in his face, as fully aſſured me that he had expreſſed the meaning of his heart; but it continued not long, when as I humbly deſired him to reſtore me my chains, and to leave me to the liberty of my Religion; that I demanded irons of him, to teſtifie that I would not go out of his ſervice: &amp; that I beſought him not to ask any more of me a thing, which I would not doe for the poſſeſſion of the Empire of the whole world, for fear I ſhould be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to diſpleaſe and diſobey him. What! ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> unto me, ſhall I give chaines to my Deliverer? ſhall I retain him ſtill to be a Slave that makes me to reign? ſhall I bind the hands of him that hath crowned me? and with a ſtrange injuſtice ſhall I make him a captive that hath made me victorious? No, no, it ſhall not be ſaid, that I could not recompence them, that have ſerved me, but with a ſhamefull ſervitude: The demand, which thou haſt made me, is worthy of thy generoſity, but this recompence would be unworthy of <hi>Soliman.</hi> He had queſtionleſs proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had he not obſerved my countenance to change, and fearing that he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed me, he began to ask me pardon, when as I perceived that I was wounded in the left arm by the blood that trickled out of the ſleeve of my habit, ſo that doubting that I would fall into a ſwoon he called in company; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing I could ſay he would needes ſee my wound ſearched, which was not found dangerous, but which might have been ſo, had the dreſſing of it been any longer retarded. It is a ſtrange thing that I did not perceive it, and if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which <hi>Soliman</hi> made unto me, had not moved me ſo violently, as to make my wound burſt out a bleeding, I believe that I had gone away without heeding it. <hi>Soliman</hi> cauſed me to be caried into a Tent, with ſo great a care, as one would have ſaid, that on the conſervation of my life depended that of his. I began then to be no longer regarded as a Slave, but as the favourite of the Emperor; every one obſerved and careſſed me, and even he that had bought me, that had laid me in irons, and had condemned me to die, was one of the moſt carefull of my health. In the mean time <hi>Soliman</hi> entred the next day into the Town with all the ceremonies of a Prince, that is Vanquiſher of his rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60144:53"/> The principall inhabitants were brought before him bound in chaines, and proſtrated with their faces on the ground; he informed himſelf preſently of the quality of their crime; he diſtinguiſhed thoſe, that had revolted out of malice, from thoſe that had been ingaged in it out of weakneſs, and by a goodneſs quite contrary to the maximes of Tyrants, the lives of five or ſix of the moſt culpable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the offence of all the reſt; and he ſhewed an example of clemencie; where others would have ſhewed one of cruelty under the name of juſtice. But whereas he had promiſed the pillage of the Town to the ſouldiers, he would not give them cauſe to complain in a time when as the enemy was ſtill in the field; neither would he alſo let them charge themſelves with booty, knowing well that the inriching of an Army is the deſtroying of it; ſo that to content them, he cauſed them to be told, that he was ready to keep his promiſe with them, but judging it not fit, <hi>Zellebis</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſcaped from his revenge, that they ſhould load themſelves with unprofitable lumber, ſince they could neither carry it away, nor ſell it, being conſtrained to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the enemy; he offered to give each of them three monthes pay, and promiſed them beſides not to return to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> without recompencing their courage. The ſouldiers accepted of this propoſition, and that they might not have leiſure to repent them, <hi>Soliman</hi> made them march away three dayes after, having left a ſtrong Gariſon in the Town to hinder any new rebellion. He had the goodneſs to deſire to know almoſt every hower in what eſtate I was, ſo that having been aſſured my wound would not keep me from following him, he teſtified a great deal of joy for it. We marched then directly to the enemy, having diſcovered by our ſcouts where he was: But whereas <hi>Zellebis,</hi> who had joyned himſelf to his Troops, would not hazard a battell lightly, he alwaies avoyded with dexterity every place, where he might be inforced to fight; and as he was cunning and malicious, ſo he invented a trick that ſucceeded happily with him. He ſaw well, that the Grand Signiors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was the ſoul of his Army; that his very ſight inſpired valor into his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and that it would be hard to vanquiſh them, as long as he ſhould be a witneſs of their courage; that he alone could heap wealth and honor on them: He ſent then with all ſpeed ſome of his faction to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſow a rumor there that <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was dead; that his Troops were defeated; &amp; that he was declared Emperor; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no queſtion, out of the knowledge he had of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> turbulent humor, which alwaies remained for the guard of the Seraglio, but that they would make ſome diſorder, that might recall <hi>Soliman</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> as indeed this ſad and falſe news was no ſooner publiſhed there, but it preſently begot a terrible confuſion. The Grand Viſier did all that he could, to learn from whence this rumor was come, to appeaſe the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> aſſuring them that he had no notice at all of what they were made to believe; but that, which he thought to retain them by, did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe them the more, and confirm them in their opinion. For (ſaid they) if <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> were not dead, the report of his victories would reach even hither; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the whole Seraglio, and all the people were in teares, and all the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in arms: But when the Grand Viſier, ſeconded by ſome of the people, and by ſome of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> would have oppoſed them, they turned all their fury, according to their cuſtom, againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they plundred all their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they demoliſhed their Chappells, they ſet ſome of them on fire, and in this confuſion making no diſtinction betwixt a <hi>Turk</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> little lacked but that they had pillaged all <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> yea they almoſt durſt enterpriſe to force the Seraglio. But in the midſt of this diſorder the Grand Viſier received a Letter from <hi>Soliman,</hi> which advertiſed him of the happy ſucceſs of his Armes, to the end he ſhould advertiſe his Subjects therewith, ſo that being aſſured of the verity of the matter, he went into the ſtreets, crying aloud, that <hi>Soliman</hi> lived, that <hi>Soliman</hi> was victorious, and that <hi>Soliman</hi> would be ſuddenly at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He pronounced theſe words with ſo much joy, as they made ſome impreſſion in the minds of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> and having ſhewed the Grand Signiors Letter to ſome of them, this truth was no longer doubted of any body. The moſt ſeditious and the moſt inſolent were the moſt amazed; the name of <hi>Soliman</hi> reſtored to them that reſpect
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60144:54"/> which avarice and violence had baniſhed from them; they threw down their arms, and craved pardon; howbeit there were ſome of them, who fearing to render that which they had taken away, made ſtrange Propoſitions: But the Grand Viſier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſe and prudent, thought it would be better to make them hope for Grace, than to make them ſtand in dread of chaſtiſement, for fear leſt putting them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair they ſhould be carried again to ſome new violence. He promiſed them then to ſpeak to the Grand Signior for them, and to aſſure him that the news of his death had ſo afflicted them, as not able to be revenged on thoſe who they believed had cauſed it, they would at leaſt be revenged on the enemies of his Religion: This diſcourſe began to calm their ſpirits, and whereas this multitude ſeems always in ſuch like encounters to have but one ſoul, which makes them operate, though they be compoſed of perſons of different thoughts, they ſuffered themſelves at length to be perſwaded that their crime ſhould not only be unpuniſhed, but alſo be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, as a mark of their zeal and affection. In the mean time the Grand Viſier diſpatched away with ſpeed to <hi>Soliman</hi> to advertiſe him of this diſorder, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his Highneſs if his affairs would permit it, to return unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for fear ſome new ſedition ſhould ariſe there; how it was unlikely, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Jewes, and ſuch Turks as had been plundered, ſhould not complain of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage had been done them, and that theſe complaints ſhould not be purſued with a new miſchief: He informed him alſo, that the affairs of <hi>Hungary</hi> went not very well, and that his preſence was neceſſary for the good of things. <hi>Soliman</hi> received this unpleaſing news with a great deal of grief, being ſorry to leave the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Zellebis</hi> to another, howbeit he judged his return to be of too great importance to be deferred; ſo that after he had given the command of the Army to the Baſſa <hi>Sinan,</hi> and inſtructed him with the order that he would have him to hold, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with as little company as poſſibly we could, to the end the Army might not be weakned, I ſay we departed, Madam, for ſince that fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate day wherein my deſpair was ſo advantagious for me, I was inſeparable from <hi>Soliman;</hi> I had a part in all his ſecrets, he told me all his thoughts, and my advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and my counſells made up moſt of his reſolutions. His return to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> produced many effects there, he gave joy to the innocent, fear to the guiltie, and hope to the Jewes and Chriſtians; and truly all theſe apprehenſions were not ill grounded, for he rewarded thoſe that had been faithfull unto him; he ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſeditious; he cauſed all that had been taken from the Jewes and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be reſtored to them; he made their Chappells and their Houſes to be re-edified; and for their goods which they had been robbed of, and could not be found, he paid them with his own money. After this, Madam, tranquillity was more ſolidly eſtabliſhed in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> than it was before; yet did not the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror judge it fit to return into <hi>Natolia</hi> by reaſon the affairs of <hi>Hungary</hi> would not ſuffer him to be ſo far abſented from it. During this intervall I had the honor to talk every day with <hi>Soliman,</hi> and to receive ſo many marks of his amity, as I could no longer refuſe him mine; but whatſoever good will he bore me (if I may be permitted to ſpeak ſo) he could not forbear perſwading me to be of his Religion, whereunto I ſo ſtrongly oppoſed my ſelf, in letting him ſee the ridiculous errors which it teacheth, as not able to make him angry with me, I forced him many times to laugh at them. In the mean time it hapned, that one morning he ſent an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary expreſs for me, and juſt as I entred into his chamber, a Baſſa, named <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> who hath maried a daughter of <hi>Solimans,</hi> and is a cunning and dextrous man, entred in alſo with me: When I was come in, <hi>Soliman</hi> told me, that he had bought a picture of a Merchant, that was come from <hi>Tauris,</hi> which he would ſhew me, for to know whether he had not been cozened, and whether it were true that he had skill in painting: He gave me then a caſe covered with Diamonds, which I opened with ſo great a tranſport, as if <hi>Soliman</hi> had had a quiet ſpirit he had perceived it; for, Madam, if one may ſay, without blaſphemy, that there is any thing in the world which doth reſemble you, it is certainly this pourtrait; and whereas the picture which you gave me was taken from me, I believed at firſt that it was it,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60144:54"/> and that to preſent it to the Grand Signior it had been put into a richer caſe; and that which ſerved to deceive me too was, that as you had drawn your ſelf like an <hi>Amazon,</hi> ſo was this alſo: But at length, after that this firſt trouble of mine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was appeaſed, I diſtinctly perceived that the eyes of the incomparable <hi>Iſabella</hi> had a fire which did not appear in thoſe of this picture, and that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance was very imperfect. It is certain nevertheleſs, that the whole Orient hath never ſeen ſo fair a perſon; alſo when <hi>Soliman</hi> demanded of me, what I thought of it, I was conſtrained to tell him, how I did not believe that <hi>Greece</hi> had ever produced any thing ſo marvellous. Thou wilt not be aſtoniſhed then, ſaid he unto me, that <hi>Soliman</hi> is charmed with it, and that he is reſolved curiouſly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf whether the Originall be as perfect as the Picture; for if the Painter hath not flattered this maid, continued he, I am the moſt amorous of men, and I cannot live without poſſeſſing her. I confeſs that this diſcourſe ſurprized me, for though it might have been ſaid in a gallantry, yet I certainly knew by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Solimans</hi> ſpeaking that he had his heart touched. He would have me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with him, that the Phyſiogminy of this perſon vvas ſpirituall; that it had a certain air of <hi>Roxelana</hi> the Sultana Queen, vvhom he had ſo much loved, and for vvhom he had ſtill ſo much reſpect: I know well, ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> unto me, how it is incomprehenſible, that he which hath the faireſt women of the world in his power, ſhould become inamoured, it may be of the imagination of a Painter, and that a mixture of colours, which cannot make but a dumb image, ſhould force me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all the moſt perfect and the moſt charming that I have ſeen, yea, and <hi>Roxelana</hi> too, whom I love more than my life. I know well enough beſides, continued he, that this perſon may be fair, and not be very amiable; that ſhe may have defects in her minde and in her humour, which her picture doth not ſhew me; that this ſweetneſs vvhich is in her eyes, is not peradventure in her heart; that this majeſty vvhich appears in her face, doth cover it may be a vvicked and baſe ſoul; and to ſay all, that ſhe is quite contrary to that I believe her to be: But in the end I am compelled to this inclination by a ſuperior povver, vvhich vvill not permit me to vvithſtand my ſelf: It is not becauſe I knovv not vvell enough vvhat is reaſon, but it is becauſe in this incounter I cannot follovv it: He prayed me that I vvould counſell him, ſo as it vvere according to his deſire. I knevv vvell by this diſcourſe that this paſſion vvas too violent to be oppoſed, ſo as I only ſaid to him, that the f rſt thing vvhich his Highneſs ought to do vvas to inform himſelf vvhere the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant had met vvith this fair object of his love, to the end he might be aſſured the Painter had dealt faithfully. He told me then, how that man had already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him that this perſon was named <hi>Felixana;</hi> that ſhe was the daughter of the Governor of <hi>Mazanderon;</hi> that ſhe lived with <hi>Axiamira,</hi> eldeſt daughter to <hi>Tachmas,</hi> Sophy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who it was thought was in love with her, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was, that <hi>Felixana,</hi> by reaſon of ſome ſecret inclination, or for ſome reaſon that was not known, did not receive the affection of that Prince favourably; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this being ſo, he reſolved to ſend <hi>Ruſtan</hi> in diſguiſe for to ſee her, to offer her all the magnificences of the Seraglio; or if ſhe would not receive them willingly, to bring her away by force, which would not be hard to do, becauſe he had learnt by another, that the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> with whom ſhe lived, went almoſt every yeer to <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> which is ſituated on the bank of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. I ſaw very well after this diſcourſe, that being generous I was not to diſguiſe my opinion in ſo important an occaſion; I took then the liberty to ſay unto <hi>Soliman</hi> in the gentleſt terms I could chooſe, that to uſe this violence was in ſome ſort to violate the Law of Nations, and to be wanting to exact juſtice; and that if <hi>Tachmas</hi> was never ſo little ſenſible of it, the fire of his love might be likely to kindle that of war; and that peradventure his Highneſs might one day repent that a picture had cauſed the ſhedding of his Subjects blood. <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who ſaw that by deſtroying the Emperors deſign I would take away his imployment from him, aſſured the Grand Signior, that he would put <hi>Felixana</hi> into his hands without the Sophy of <hi>Perſiaes</hi> ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what was become of her; that he knew almoſt an undoubted mean to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60144:55"/> execute that which he had ſaid, provided he would give him a Veſſell well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all things neceſſary; that he would cauſe all his ſouldiers to be attired like Slaves, to the end they might be the leſs miſtruſted; that as for him, he would alſo attire himſelf like a Merchant, and lade his Veſſell with all that was moſt rare at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> of the commodities of <hi>Europe,</hi> and moſt proper to touch the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of women; that after this he beſought his Highneſs not to command him to ſay more, and to be contented with the Oath that he made him to return him his head at his feet, if he did not bring <hi>Felixana.</hi> This promiſe did ſo ſooth the paſſion of the Emperor, as not able to keep himſelf from following it, he had the goodneſs to ask my pardon if he did not ſubmit his ſenſe to mine, telling me how I had at leaſt this advantage, that he confeſſed I had reaſon, and that he would remember how his glory was dear unto me, ſince I had been ſo generous, as not to fear to offend him in oppoſing my ſelf to the injuſtice of his deſign; that in the mean time we ſhould deal in ſuch ſort as <hi>Roxelana</hi> might have no notice of it. In the end, Madam, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had the equipage he required for this goodly conqueſt, and I had more civilities than I deſerved. Howbeit <hi>Soliman</hi> was conſtrained a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the departure of <hi>Ruſtan</hi> to interrupt his amorous thoughts, for to think of the affairs of <hi>Natolia,</hi> which ſince his return to <hi>Conſtantinopie</hi> were very much changed; for as ſoon as <hi>Zellebis</hi> had been advertiſed by his Spies, that the Emperor was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, he took as much care to joyn with his enemy, as he had uſed before to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void him: And whereas <hi>Sinan</hi> had order to give battell, when occaſion ſhould ſerve for it, the two Armies were not long before they incountred together. If one ſhould alwayes judge of the event of the fight by the number of the Souldiers, it is certain that the Baſſa would have vanquiſhed <hi>Zellebis,</hi> who had a great many fewer than he, but he was ſo unfortunate, and according to ſome, of ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that he let the enemies Army take all the advantages of the field, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were for the ſituation, or the wind, which drave all the duſt and the ſmoke in the faces of ours, whereby they were extremely incommodated. It hapned alſo t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at when the Battell began, the Sun was covered with clouds, ſo that the Baſſa <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> not having obſerved on which ſide it was, or not having fore-ſeen that it might break forth, he placed his ſouldiers with their eys juſt againſt it, who ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceived that this light which blinded them, kept them oftentimes from being able either to ſtrike their enemies, or to avoid their blows. At laſt, Madam, the Sun cleared the defeat of the Baſſa, and the triumph of <hi>Zellebis,</hi> and the Emperors Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was ſo routed, as in above eight days after a thouſand ſouldiers were not found together. This news very much afflicted <hi>Soliman,</hi> and whereas I was the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his pleaſure, and of his grief, I received order to come unto him; but I was ſcarcely entred into his Cabinet, when as he fell to asking of me, whether I would have him diſhonoured? Whether I had reſolved to let that be loſt which I had gotten? Whether I had taken the Capitall Town of <hi>Natolia</hi> to ſerve for a retreat to a coward, which had blemiſhed the glory of his Arms? For at length, ſaid he unto me, the Baſſa <hi>Sinan</hi> is retired thither, after he hath loſt a battell, and after he hath let mine enemy take the Arms of the Empire: Now judge, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> continued he, what I am to attend from thee; thy valor hath once already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed my glory, it is again by thee that I muſt hold it; from thy hand it is that I will have the head of <hi>Zellebis,</hi> and from thy arm that I look for victory: Oppoſe thy ſelf no longer then againſt my will; nor can I ever reſolve that thou ſhouldſt quit me; I love thee too well, or to ſay better, I love my ſelf too vvell to give thee liberty to go out of my State. Reſolve then for that vvhich I have ſo often deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee, and vvhich I dare not almoſt expreſs more clearly unto thee, for fear of grieving thee; at length <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> take a Turbant and a Scimitar, and after that, I make thee the chief of my Empire, mine enemies are ſubdued, and <hi>Soliman</hi> is contented. It is certain, that the manner wherewith this diſcourſe was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſomewhat moved my minde, but it is true nevertheleſs that it never ſhaked my ſoul; I beſought the Emperor not to hearken ſo much to the affection he bore me, but that he would alſo hearken unto reaſon; that the firſt blinded his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60144:55"/> in perſwading him that I was capable of great things; but the ſecond ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him clearly, that he demanded of me a thing, not only unjuſt, but impoſſible to an heart as mine was: For, my Lord, ſaid I unto him, our thoughts depend not upon our wills; that which we call faith amongſt us, is a grace that comes from above, and is not acquired by naturall knowledge; it is a thing then which can not be forced; it is a preſent from Heaven which is to be conſerved with the perill of ones life, and which is not under the dominion of Kings: Let thy Highneſs pardon me then if I refuſe thee a thing which I would not doe for the poſſeſſion of the whole Univerſe, no nor at the ſight of a death, the moſt terrible and moſt dreadfull that can be. If I ſhould refuſe thee, continued I, either my blood or my life, which are the only things whereof I can diſpoſe, I ſhould think my ſelf guilty of the blackeſt ingratitude that ever was; but being far from ſo baſe a thought, I moſt humbly beſeech thee permit me to go and affront the Army of the enemy, to try, the firſt of all, his fury and his rage, and if it be poſſible to grapple with <hi>Zellebis,</hi> and ſacrifice his life to thy vengeance, or mine to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Thy Highneſs hath but too well made known unto me, how thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt that when I was loaden with chains I had the good fortune to vanquiſh thine enemies; do thou judge then by what I have done, of that which I will do in this occaſion, whenas ſo many teſtimonies of affection render me indebted to thy Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that being no longer fettered with irons, I may make uſe of all my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and of all my force: Let a Scymitar then, my Lord, be only given me, and let me be placed in the formoſt rank of thine Army; and to oblige thy Highneſs from requiring that only thing of me which I can refuſe thee, do but conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and conſult with thy moſt ſecret thoughts, and then demand of thy ſelf, if the good hap of Chriſtendom had been ſuch, as that thou wert powerfully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the truth of our Religion, whether thou wouldſt be capable of changing it for the conqueſt of all the world: But it is too much importuning thy Highneſs to ask a juſt thing of thee with ſo many reaſons; and it is, as it were, to commit a crime to make any doubt of obtaining it. <hi>Soliman</hi> heard me with a great deal of unquietneſs, and when I had done ſpeaking he was a pretty while without anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me: And although the thoughts of men are hard to be known, yet I well obſerved, that choler, reaſon, and amity reigned ſucceſſively in his heart; but at length, after he had diſputed with himſelf, he ſaid unto me with ſomewhat a more quiet countenance, That not being able to change his mind, nor being able like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to rid himſelf of the affection he bare me, he had found out an expedient which I could not refuſe him, unleſs I were reſolved to incur his hatred; and which he would grant me, if the <hi>Muphti,</hi> who is the head of their Religion, thought he might do it without offending the Prophet. He propounded then unto me, only to take the habit of the Turks, to the end that being believed to be ſo, he might confer Charges upon me, and keep me about him: And to perſwade the people that I had changed my Religion, he would ſo order it, that the <hi>Muphti</hi> ſhould aſſure all the world, that he had performed the ceremony of it in private in the Moſque of the Seraglio; that he was confident this man loved his head too well to reveal a ſecret of ſo great importance; that in the mean time I might live a Chriſtian under the habit of a Muſſulman, and render him the happieſt Prince of the Earth. I confeſs, that I had more ado to anſwer to this laſt propoſition, than to the other; howbeit I requeſted him to remember, that diſſimulation was not to go ſo far as to the Altars; that love and war did many times permit ſuch things, but that Religion required much ſincerity; and that in the ſame which I profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there was an expreſs Commandment to publiſh it openly. I would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, but choler ſo ſurmounted the Sultan, as I was conſtrained to hold my peace, for fear of incenſing him further. I well enough perceived, that amity had ſtill a place in his ſoul, maugre his fury; I ſaw tears of ſpight and kindneſs in his eyes, and how violent ſoever his diſcourſe was he always intermingled things amongſt it, which made me eaſily diſcern, that he had an affection for me which could never be deſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60144:56"/> ſhould make no further reply unto him; that all the grace he could do me vvas to permit me to go and conſult vvith the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men of <hi>Pera,</hi> about an occaſion vvherein they had as much intereſt as I; for it may be, ſaid he unto me, after I have favoured them ſo much in conſideration of thee, I may very vvell deſtroy them for the ſame cauſe, and on them revenge my ſelf of thy inſenſibility, and of the anger I am in for that I cannot leave loving thee, to the end thou mightſt puniſh thy ſelf: But go, continued he, and let me hear thy laſt reſolution within two dayes: for otherwiſe I ſhall be able to take one which may make thee repent, that thou haſt ſo ill acknowledged the affection that I ſtill bear thee, mangre thy obdurateneſs. When he had given over ſpeaking, I withdrew with a profound reſpect, and conſidering with my ſelf what I had to do, it ſeemed juſt unto me not to rely upon mine own proper ſenſe in a matter of ſo great importance. Thoſe menaces of <hi>Soliman</hi> would not have ſhaken me, had they been addreſt to no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ſave my ſelf, but the fear of involving ſo great a number of innocents in a miſchief, which ought not to have regarded any but me, made me reſolve to have recourſe unto the reaſon of others, mine not being free enough, nor ſufficiently diſintereſſed to operate juſtly in this incounter. The averſion which I had for life, being abſent from you, helped to perſwade me too, that my Religion permitted not that which was deſired of me. I aſſembled then the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the Greek Church, and his principall Calviers, for the Latin is not yet eſtabliſhed in <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and whereas I had ſeen them oftentimes after I was there, I propounded the matter unto them, with all the circumſtances which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was neceſſary to tell them, to the end they might the better underſtand the importance of the affair: I let them know the extreme affection which <hi>Soliman</hi> bare me; the menaces he uſed againſt them in conſideration of me; the promiſes I had received from him if I did that which he deſired; at laſt I expoſed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſincerely unto them juſt as it had paſt, and without diſguiſing my ſenſe I gave them to underſtand, that provided they might be in ſafety, I ſhould be glad they would find that I could not ſatisfie <hi>Soliman</hi> but with the loſs of my life. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a diſpute then, which laſted a good while; they would not truſt to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, but would look over their books, and not judge tumultuouſly of the affair. The opinions were divided for an hour and more, and either ſide ſeemed to have very ſtrong reaſons to maintain their party; but in the end the Patriarch told them, that as amongſt us we daily ſee religious men ſent forth in the habit of Merchants, or Cavaliers, for the converting of ſouls, ſo the ſame diſguiſement might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one, provided it were for the ſame cauſe, and that the ſole intereſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom carried me to this deceit, which certainly would bring me to happineſs in heaven, and to glory on earth, if I could reſolve to execute it generouſly; that the power which I had over the ſpirit of <hi>Soliman,</hi> might peradventure be ſo great, as to make him doubt of his Religion; that it may be his converſion might be reſerved for me; and that if this ſhould happen, it would render the greateſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Chriſtendom that ever was rendred unto it; that thereon peradventure depended the ſafety of an hundred thouſand perſons; and that in concluſion his advice was, that I could not fail in this occaſion. This opinion being become ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall amongſt them, they conjured me to ſubmit my ſenſe to theirs, in ſatisfying <hi>Soliman,</hi> and that they would ingage their conſciences to me, that mine ſhould be diſcharged of all fault in this incounter, ſo as I let not my ſelf be blinded with greatneſs, and that the protection of Chriſtendom were the only motive that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to this diſguiſement. I did what I could to oblige them to change their advice; I made an hundred objections, and an hundred demands to them; I told them, that although I ſhould not bear arms againſt Chriſtendom, as I was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to do, yet I ſhould not alwayes forbear hurting it, if I ſerved in other occaſions, becauſe I ſhould ſtill be augmenting the Turkiſh Empire. But they told me, ſo as I carried the war to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> it would amuſe <hi>Soliman</hi> unprofitably for himſelf, and profitably for the Chriſtians; for that the conqueſts which the Turks made upon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> could never, through a kinde of extraordinary fate, be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60144:56"/> conſerved by them; that in this ſort occupying <hi>Soliman</hi> in that war, it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the means of turning his Arms againſt Chriſtendom; that of two evills the leaſt was alwayes to be choſen; and finally, that I ſhould in my perſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the miſeries which ſhould arrive unto them, if I did not yeeld a blind obedience to what they ordained, whenas I ſufficiently knew that reaſon would have it to be ſo. I was forced then to follow their directions, and to go unto <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> after I had been inſtructed by them concerning all that I was to do. As for that Prince, when he had propounded the matter to the <hi>Muphti</hi> in ſuch terms as teſtified that he deſired it, he that made no other uſe of the Religion whereof he was the Head, but his own profit, failed not to tell the Sultan, out of the hope of a recompence, that the thing was not only permitted, but was alſo meritorious, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it conduced to the ſervice of the Empire, which the Prophet had eſtabliſhed. As ſoon as the Sultan ſaw me, he came to me, and beholding me with a fixed eye, he ſought to know the thoughts of my heart by the motions of my face; but not giving him leave to ſpeak to me, I aſſured him that I came to obey him, provided that his Higneſs would accord me three things which I deſired of him. I had no ſooner ſaid thus, but that without knowing what I would have, this Prince aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me that they were granted unto me; I beſought him then to hear me firſt, to the end that precipitating nothing I might never give him occaſion to complain of me. After he had given me the liberty to ſay what I would to him, I humbly requeſted him not to take it ill, that being his Slave I ſhould be ſo bold as to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with him, and give bounds to his Authority; for, my Lord, ſaid I unto him I do not conſent unto this diſguiſement, which thy Highneſs deſires of me, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that thou ſhalt never ſpeak to me to put that in effect, which I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do in ſhew; that thou wilt permit me to have always about me in the habit of a Slave, a Prieſt of my Religion, whom I will procure to come from one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But not to loſe time, ſaid he unto me, I will have thy change publiſhed preſently, to the end the people may not be ſurpriſed with it; in the mean ſpace I will go and give order for the <hi>Muphti</hi> to come to me, and will command him to repair to thee eight dayes one after another, to make the world think that he inſtructs thee, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares thee for this Ceremony, which ſhall oblige thee to keep thy chamber the whilſt, the better to make it be believed that it will be performed. At length, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, not to prolong this diſcourſe with vain repetitions, the buſineſs was done as it had been propounded, and this dumb ſhew was ſo well carried, as no body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved it but to be ſo. As long as I kept the houſe I was viſited by the chiefeſt of the Empire, who judged rightly, that the affection of <hi>Soliman</hi> having no other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to hinder him from imploying me, would without doubt bring me into an eſtate able to ſerve them, as indeed it was not long before I perceived that their conjectures were true; for the ſecond day after this impoſture, I found, that I had an houſe, a magnificent train, rich clothes, and to conclude an equipage propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the imployment which <hi>Soliman</hi> gave me, by making me Generall of the Army in the place of the Baſſa <hi>Sinan:</hi> And to teſtifie his amity the better unto me, he gave me wherewith to render ſecretly to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the reſt that had counſelled me, the Tribute which he had drawn from them the laſt three years, and cauſed alſo the foundation of a Palace to be laid, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60144:57"/> I finiſhed. In the mean time he had taken care, that I ſhould have troops ready to march, when I had ſatisfied the civilities of the Ceremony, ſo that at ſuch time as I went firſt to ſalute him in a Turkiſh habit, I found that that, which I believed ſhould have been one of my ordinary viſits, was a farewell for me to go and command the Army of <hi>Natolia.</hi> I will not tell you, Madam, the joy which this Prince ſhewed in this occaſion, it was ſo great, as my tongue hath not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion powerfull enough to paint it forth unto you; but in the end to let you ſee in what eſtate I was with him, I have but to tell you, that after he had fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me about the affairs of <hi>Natolia,</hi> and that he had commanded me to take upon me the Conduct of his Army, he told me, that to do me juſtice, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Baſſa <hi>Sinan</hi> both for the cruelty he had before times uſed towards me, and for the cowardiſe he had ſhewed, his pleaſure was, that yeelding me his place, he ſhould withall take that in my ſervice which I had held in his, namely, Madam, that he ſhould be my ſlave as I had been his. I muſt confeſs here, that without play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generoſo this propoſition grieved me very much, and notwithſtanding all the reſpect I had to <hi>Soliman,</hi> as ſoon as he acquainted me with his intention I caſt my ſelf at his feet, humbly to beſeech him not to command me the doing of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a thing, nor to require, that a man who had been my Maſter, ſhould be reduced to miſery and infamy; that for my part, I could never reſolve to put him in chains that had commanded me, and who, it may be, was more infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than faulty: I repreſented then unto him that the fate of war doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mock at humane prudence; that force and number do not alwayes ſuffice to have the better; and laſtly, that victory doth not always attend upon valor and juſtice. After all theſe reaſons, which peradventure had not been potent enough to move him, I begged the liberty and fortune of this man for a recompence of all the ſervices which I would render him, and beſought him to be contented with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him from the Port, by ſending him to be Governor of ſome one of his Provinces. <hi>Soliman</hi> reſiſted my requeſt at firſt, but afterwards conſented thereunto, upon condition that the Baſſa ſhould know how much he was obliged unto me; then he gave me a Letter for him, whereby he was commanded to remit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Army into my hands, and ſtraightly imbracing me, Go, ſaid he unto me, my dear <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> whither thy glory calls thee, where mine requires thee, and where victory attends thee: But when thou ſhalt be accumulated with honour, when thou ſhalt have re-eſtabliſhed that of my Arms, and triumphed over mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, come and receive the recompence that I ſhall prepare for thee, and quietly enjoy the fruit of thy labors. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> having obſerved ſome change in <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> face, thought it was fit for him to ſay, I perceive, Madam, that this name of <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> doth ſurprize and aſtoniſh you, but your aſtoniſhment will ceaſe, when I ſhall have told you, that in changing of habit I did not change my name, and that this which I bear is the ſame with that of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> amongſt the Turks. It is true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Princeſs, that I was ſtrangely ſurprized by this name, but it is true alſo, that my aſtoniſhment is not yet finiſhed; for could it be poſſible that you ſhould be that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> of whom the relations of the <hi>Levant</hi> hath told us ſuch wonders? whoſe valour hath done ſuch miracles, who hath conquered a part of <hi>Perſia,</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many great battails, cauſed <hi>Soliman</hi> to be crowned at <hi>Bagdet,</hi> and who paſſeth for ſo extraordinary a man, as it is not believed the Orient hath ever had the like? Now, I pray you, hold me no longer in ſuſpence, but after you have cleared that unto me which I ask of you, purſue the ſequele of your Hiſtory, and acquaint me exactly with all that hath befallen you. I know very well, Madam, replyed <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano,</hi> that after that which you have ſaid, I ſhould, if I were modeſt, diſavow my ſelf, but being true and ſincere I muſt confeſs, that I am that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> whom fame hath ſo much flattered, as I cannot tell how to know my ſelf by the pourtrait which your Excellency hath made of me by her report: Rely not then upon that which this deceiver hath told you, and to make you the Iudge thereof do but give ear to the proceſs of my adventures. As ſoon as I was arrived at <hi>Natolia</hi> with the Troops which the Grand Signior had given me to conduct thither, I went directly

I comforted him the beſt I could, and promiſed him, that if the Emperor continued his favour to me, I would continue alſo to ſerve him. After this I imployed all my care to carry my ſelf in ſuch ſort, that the hopes which <hi>Soliman</hi> had of me might not be fruſtrated. I cauſed my Army to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and having put it into Battell Array, I went from rank to rank to viſit all the Troops, and incouraging them to do well, (for I had learnt the language of the Countrey perfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After this diſcourſe, they made ſhouts of joy, which perſwaded me that I was agreeable to them. Then came all the Commanders to take the Oath of Obedience to me, and to aſſure me that they would follow me to the death: That done, I marched directly to the enemy, who was not above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty miles from us; but whereas he had been advertiſed that the Slave which had taken <hi>Chientaia,</hi> was Generall of the Army that was comming to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque him, the remembrance of what had paſt made him to fear that which was to inſue, and for that reaſon he diſcamped in haſt, with a purpoſe to retire to a ſide of <hi>Natolia,</hi> wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> it had been impoſſible to have forced him to fight. When I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his deſign by the way his Army took, I reſolved to prevent him, by cauſing my forces to march a whole night with all poſſible ſpeed: The matter ſucceeded ſo happily, that my Army having had leiſure to reſt three or four hours, began to ſee that of <hi>Zellebis</hi> appear, who being ſoon advertiſed of this warlike ſtratagem, entred into ſuch deſpair for having been ſurpriſed in this ſort, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to accept of the Battell which I preſented unto him. I was glad to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his deſign, and to inſpire my Souldiers with the ſame thought, I aſſured them, after I had given order for all things, that the juſtice of the cauſe we defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was a preſage of the victory; that it was eaſier to puniſh Rebels, who carried a domeſtique enemy in their hearts, which reproached them with their crime, than to vanquiſh men whoſe Arms were lawfull; that they whom we were to fight with, being reſolved for it more by fear and neceſſity, than by valour, it would be but too eaſie for our glory to remain victorious: I repreſented alſo unto them, that the travail they had endured in going ſo faſt, was not diſadvantageous unto them, it being moſt certain, that they which fly are wearied more than they which purſue them; that the end of the War depending on this battell, I was reſolved to vanquiſh or to dye; and that all the favour I demanded of them was, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the way which I was going to ſhew them. I had no ſooner done ſpeaking, but they teſtified unto me, both by their ſhouts and by their actions, their deſire to fight; ſo that not ſuffering ſo noble a heat to cool, I marched on foremoſt to the Enemy. I will not ſtand, Madam, to particularize this battell, ſince it would be to abuſe your patience, and be wanting in good manners, to entertain you ſo long with matters of war; it ſhall ſuffice then to tell you that which regards me direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing you will have it ſo, although it be not without bluſhing. Wherefore I ſhall only ſay, Madam, that at firſt the enemies received us couragiouſly, and that they repulſed us ſeverall times with ſuch ardour, as deſpair did more in them than valour in us; but after that the victory had hung ballancing on either ſide, and that the hope of carrying it had poſſeſſed each party more than once, it was my good fortune, maugre the confuſion of the fight, to know <hi>Zellebis</hi> by the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60144:58"/> hand, and the other at his ſaddle-bow; he was alſo many times armed after the Perſian manner, ſo as no way doubting but that it was he, I brake through the preſs to meet him, and calling him by his name, I told him, that the ſame Slave, who before had vanquiſhed him in his chains, was come to make him ſatisfaction for that outrage in Arms; I ſpake to him in this ſort, becauſe I had underſtood that in a ſpeech to his ſouldiers, after he had heard that I was Generall of the Army, he had told them in a jeering way, that I was ſtill ſo tired with wearing of irons, as it would be eaſie for him to overcome me: Howbeit fortune diſpoſed of it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not becauſe he was not a more valiant man than I, but becauſe I was more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than he. As ſoon as he underſtood that which I have told you, he ſeconded my deſign; and that we might the better enter into a particular fight we freed our ſelves, as well as we could, from thoſe that invironed us, and being ſeparated from the reſt, we began our combat. I doubt not, Madam, but you will be aſtoniſhed with that which I am going to acquaint you with, ſince it is certain, that one will have much adoe not to be ſurprized with a thing which hath no example in all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which your imagination would not fore-ſee. It hapned then, Madam, that ſome of ours having obſerved this action, and having told it to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, this rumour ſpread it ſelf ſo ſuddenly amongſt the two Armies, that as if thoſe two great bodies had had but one ſpirit, which had animated them, they took both of them the ſame reſolution, and confided ſo in the valor of their Chieftains, as they determined to be ſpectators of the victory, which they attended from them. They of my party ſaid, that they would not ſhare the glory of this day with me, and that I would carry it away well enough without their ſuccour; and others muttered, that he who had known ſo well how to begin the war, knew alſo how to finiſh it gloriouſly. At length, Madam, the moſt earneſt to fight, ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to behold us; and as if there had been ſome inchantment in this adventure, every one retired to his own Enſign, and in an inſtant the field of our combat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be in the midſt of two Armies in Battell Array. This event ſurpriſed me in ſuch ſort, as it had like to have coſt me my life; for whereas, maugre the heat of the fight, I had conſerved ſo much coldneſs and judgement, as to mark what was done, and to be aſtoniſhed at it, going to turn about my head towards my ſouldiers to give them aſſurance that I fought for them, I furniſhed mine enemy with ſuch an opportunity, as being loath to loſe that advantage, he ſtruck me ſo great a blow with his Scymitar upon my Turbant, as I was almoſt bereft of my ſenſes, and if by good hap it had not turned in his hand, I had certainly been loſt: Hereupon aroſe cries from both parties, which amidſt their confuſion teſtified their thoughts unto us; and whereas mine had obſerved, that I had received this blow by looking at them, they would have advanced, which I perceiving by the enemies countenance, I ſeparated my ſelf ſome dozen or fourteen paces from <hi>Zellebis</hi> to charge them not to ſtir, and to confirm them in that deſign I returned to <hi>Zellebis</hi> with ſuch courage, as they were perſwaded it would not be eaſie for him to ſurmount me. Howbeit we diſputed this victory a long time, and verily this man combated with ſuch heart, as gave me a great deſire to ſave him; ſo that his horſe having thrown him to the ground upon a blow that I unwittingly gave him, I told him that if he would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf I would promiſe to get his pardon of <hi>Soliman;</hi> but being got up again with fury, and having anſwered me, that he would have the victory, or die, I would not combat him with advantage, ſo that being alighted from my horſe we began a new fight, which was more infortunate for him than the former: For feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my ſelf hurt in the left arm, the deſire which I had to vanquiſh redoubled in ſuch manner, as in a little time his death put fear in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some of his ſeeing him fall would have advanced to revenge his loſs, or to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his body, but they were ſo rudly repulſed, as they were conſtrained to change that deſign into that of breaking and flying: I then commanded my men to cry out in purſuing them, that they ſhould be received to grace which would render themſelves; this voyce failed not to work its effect, for out of the deſpair where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were, for having loſt not only the Generall of their Army, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60144:58"/> of all this war, many of them flung down their Arms; the reſt were cut in pieces, ſome excepted that retired into the revolted Towns; but I can ſay, that they which eſcaped the purſuit of our Forces contributed not the leaſt to our glory, for they brought ſo great a terror to the places which they had choſen for their retreat, as in fifteen dayes they rendred all to the obedience of the Grand Signior. In the mean time to make good my word, and to follow the cuſtom of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, I ſent the head of <hi>Zellebis</hi> to <hi>Soliman,</hi> who doubtleſs was not ſo glad at the death of his enemy for the intereſt he had in it, as he was becauſe he believed that this action was glorious to me: And whereas he had an extreme deſire to ſee me, I had order to return unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Natolia</hi> ſhould be peaceable, and that I had ſecured all the revolted places. I was not long before I was in an eſtate to obey him, for whereas <hi>Zellebis</hi> was the onely man that remained of the Race of <hi>Chaz-haſſen,</hi> ſo conſiderable with the <hi>Calenders,</hi> and the <hi>Deruis,</hi> there vvas no one found amongſt them vvhom the reſt vvould obey; the equality of their birth and condition vvas the cauſe that never a one in particular vvould indure that another ſhould command, and this diſſenſion put them into ſuch diſorder, as they were more revolted amongſt themſelves, than againſt their Soveraign. I profited by the advertiſement I received hereof, for <hi>Soliman</hi> having ſent me an abſolute power to pardon, or to puniſh, I commanded them to yeeld, promiſing to make their peace with the Grand Signior, but threatning that if they did not accept of the pardon which I offered them, to extirpate them utterly, and to cauſe all the <hi>Deruis,</hi> and all the <hi>Calenders</hi> to be baniſhed from out of the whole extent of the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. This was done in a conjuncture ſo favourable, that they all with one voyce reſolved to render themſelves; there was not a Town which did not open their Gates, receive a Governor from my hand, and a Garriſon ſtrong enough to keep them from rebelling another time; and for more ſurety, I cauſed all the <hi>Deruis</hi> and <hi>Calenders</hi> to be diſarmed, repreſenting unto them, that the profeſſion of men of Religion did not permit them to have Arms; and that their crime could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a lighter puniſhment, than to be contented that the means of their future of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending ſhould be taken from them. At length, Madam, after I had ſet an order to all things, I returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where for a recompence of that little I had done, <hi>Soliman</hi> made me Baſſa, and Grand Viſier, which is the prime Charge of that Empire; for it had ſo fallen out, that he who poſſeſſed it died in my abſence. I did all that I could to refuſe this honor, but in the end I was conſtrained to accept of it, both by the Commandment of the Grand Signior, and by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Religious men of <hi>Pera,</hi> and of the Patriarch of the Greek Church, whom I ſtill acquainted with all that befell me, by a Prieſt diſguiſed like a ſlave, which alwayes attended on me, alleging this reaſon to me for it, that the more power I had, the more utile I ſhould be for Chriſtendom.

In the mean ſeaſon this Prince thought many times on <hi>Felixana,</hi> extremely marvelling at the long voyage of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> upon vvhoſe comming he had placed a great deal of hope; but fortune that often delighteth in extraordinary things, and loves to give weak beginnings to the moſt important affairs, had diſpoſed of it in a faſhion which <hi>Soliman</hi> did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee: And how prudent ſoever he was, he did not conſider, that Love and Fortune, who were to give ſucceſs to this adventure, were two Deities too blinde to beſtow all that he deſired on him, although he deſerved it; and indeed he was deceived by them both, for he was amazed to ſee <hi>Ruſtan</hi> return very melancholick, without Slaves, vvithout Souldiers, vvithout a Veſſell, and vvithout <hi>Felixana.</hi> At firſt he believed that his deſign having been diſcovered all his equipage had been taken from him, and that he had been ill intreated; but vvhen he had commanded him

What! ſayd he to himſelf, as he told me after his return, is it poſſible that <hi>Felixana</hi> ſhould be turned into <hi>Aximira?</hi> that the daughter of the Governour of <hi>Mazanderon</hi> ſhould become the daughter of the Sophy of <hi>Perſia?</hi> or that through an extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture a Merchant ſhould be ſo daring as to aſſure a thing to <hi>Soliman,</hi> whereof he was not well aſſured himſelf? Hereupon having opened the caſe wherein the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60144:59"/> was, which the Grand Signior had given him, and alſo recollecting his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and his memory, for the comparing of it with the originall, and for the obſerving of all the lineaments in particular, his eyes ſo confirmed him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that it was the Picture of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> as he made no longer doubt of it. Then it was, that he ſaw himſelf combated with divers thoughts; for whereas he is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, hardy, cunning, and wicked, and that to attain to a glorious imployment, would undertake any thing; the fear of diſpleaſing <hi>Soliman</hi> either in venturing to tarry <hi>Axiamira</hi> forcibly away, or in returning without doing ought, agitated him ſo mightily, as he was ten or twelve daies ſick upon it, during which time he did nothing but paſs up and down in his mind all the reaſons that might induce him, either to the forcible carrying away of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> or to the reſtraining him from it: On the one ſide he thought, that the Grand Signior having made choice of him for the ſervice of his amorous paſſion, he ſhould be but badly received, if at his return he only brought back for the fruit of his voyage, that <hi>Felixana</hi> reſembled not the picture which had been given him; He feared alſo that <hi>Solimans</hi> hope being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that which he had of being <hi>Beglerbei</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> would be ſo too; Wherefore regarding the matter after another ſort, he laboured to find anothers ſatisfaction in his own. But the more he conſidered the deſign of carrying away of <hi>Axiami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> by force, the more obſtacles he found therein; he was not powerfull enough to force the Town or Caſtle, and the retiredneſs wherein the women live over all the Orient, permitted him not the means to work upon any of thoſe that were neer the Princeſs for the ſuborning them: But above all things, the ſole apprehenſion that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould not approve of his deſign, and ſhould be offended to underſtand, that inſtead of forcibly carrying away the daughter of a ſimple Governour, he ſhould have forcibly carried away that of one of the mightieſt Princes of the world, put him into an unquietneſs that cannot be expreſt; and I verily believe by that which I could conjecture out of his own relation, that this laſt fear had abſolutely maſtered his ſoul, and carried him to return without enterprizing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had not the misfortune of the unhappy <hi>Axiamira</hi> made him change his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and brought her to contribute her ſelf to her own ruin, without thinking of it. This excellent Princeſs took ſo much pleaſure in fiſhing, and was ſo deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this ſport, as there were few fair dayes which ſhe imployed not in this maritime chaſe; and whereas all <hi>Perſia</hi> was quiet, having no war either domeſtick or forein, ſhe went to this innocent warfare, more accompanied with fiſher-men than ſouldiers, and almoſt without other arms than nets and hooks. During the time that <hi>Ruſtans</hi> ſickneſs laſted, he obſerved that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was two or three days a fiſhing, and having dextrouſly informed himſelf from ſome Merchants who dealt with him, that the Princeſs uſed oftentimes ſo to do, he underſtood wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I have declared, ſo that no longer judging this deſign, which he had believed to be impoſſible, other than a little hazardous, and having a Veſſell that was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sayler, well furniſhed with all things, and never a Mariner but which was a Souldier, he looked on this affair after another manner, and out of an extreme inhumanity he reaſoned in this ſort. I have order from <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſaid he, to put him in poſſeſſion of the Originall of this Picture; it is not the name of <hi>Felixana</hi> that makes him amorous, it is the beauty of <hi>Axiamira</hi> which he hath ſeen in this pourtrait; it is then <hi>Axiamira</hi> whom I am forcibly to carry away: It is true, that ſhe is a Princeſs, but it is alſo true, that therein fortune favors me, in giving me the means to acquire a treaſure for <hi>Soliman</hi> far more precious than he believed it to be; the boldneſs of my enterprize will make the greatneſs of my recompence, and will manifeſt to his Highneſs, that there is nothing which I would not do to obey him. Behold, Madam, the unjuſt reaſons wherewith <hi>Ruſtan</hi> authoriſed his enterprize, but the true were, as I have already ſaid, that he hath naughty inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that he is born for crime and violence; and that he is ſo much an enemy to goodneſs, as it ſufficeth to be vertuous for to be hated of him. He took the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution then to carry away <hi>Axiamira</hi> by force, at ſuch time as ſhe ſhould go a fiſhing; but to faciliate his deſign he judged it fit to get him out of the Port, and to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60144:60"/> end they ſhould not marvail at his departure, he to obtain permiſſion for it cauſed the Princeſs to be told, that having received advertiſement how a veſſell of his Country was within three or four daies to be at a Port that was not above ten miles from <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> he was reſolved to go and wait for it there, to deal for ſome commodities vvhich he thought he had had, but had forgot to bring along vvith him, that at his return he vvould not fail to let her ſee the rarities, whereof he had ſpoken, not being able to do it ſooner by reaſon of his ſickneſs: And to ſhew that he intended to return again, he ſuffered himſelf to be unpayd by ſome Merchants that were in his debt. He parted then in this manner, leaving the Princeſs very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of his return, in regard of her inclinations to ſuch rare things; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had no deſign to eloign himſelf much, and had obſerved how the Princeſs uſed ordinarily to take that way whereby he came thither, he put his veſſell into the covert of a Creek three miles from the Port, where the point of a Rock advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo far into the ſea, as they that came from the Towns ſide could not ſee them which were there, before they were ſo near as they could not decline a fight. It was here where <hi>Ruſtan</hi> reſolved to attend the Princeſs, being confident that ſhe vvould not be long before ſhe came thither, becauſe he knevv it was the place moſt proper for her ſport: In the mean time to beguile the veſſels, which paſſing by might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him, he ſet up the Flag of <hi>Perſia</hi> in his Main-top, and cauſed all his men that appeared on the deck to change their habit; for the cunning of this man had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all things, and had not omitted ought that could conduce to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs of ſo miſchievous a deſign. Now accordingly this deplorable Princeſs, no way doubting of the treaſon that was intended againſt her, reſolved the next day after <hi>Ruſtans</hi> departure, to recreate her ſelf on the ſea; but to make up her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, ſhe would not that day go a fiſhing, but onely take the air, and paſs away the time more freely with her women. In the mean ſeaſon <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had made a ſpeech to his ſouldiers and Mariners, vvhom he had gained with gifts, to encourage them to well-doing, if it hapned that he ſhould command them to attacque a veſſel. He told them, that what he deſired of them was the leaſt exploit he could expect from their valour, ſince it was a veſſel without Ordnance, and more laden with women than ſouldiers; that above all things they ſhould beware of doing any outrage to the Ladies; but for the men, that they ſhould not ſpare them, it being neceſſary that none ſhould eſcape which might teſtifie ought concerning this Action. After this he ſet a ſentinell on the top of the Rock to diſcover when <hi>Axiamiraes</hi> veſſell ſhould come out of the Port, for to advertiſe him of it. The impatience of this Raviſher laſted not long; for, as I have already declared, the next day after his departure, the Princeſs reſolved to go and take the air: no ſooner was ſhe on the ſea, but the ſentinell advertiſed <hi>Ruſtan</hi> of it, who with all ſpeed fitted his ſhip, and prepared his men to do that which he had commanded them. Scarcely had he given order for every thing, whenas the Princeſſes veſſell appeared; ſhe was ſitting in the Stern upon Cuſhions of cloth of Gold, with all her women about her, and attired like an <hi>Amazon,</hi> as her picture repreſented her, having a Dart in her right-hand, upon which ſhe leaned: As ſoon as ſhe perceived <hi>Ruſtans</hi> veſſel, ſhe roſe up ſuddainly to obſerve it, as if ſhe had foreſeen what was to arrive unto her; this firſt apprehenſion was quickly ſeconded by another more grievous one; for juſt as the Princeſs roſe up, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> changed the deſign he had of following her, that ſo he might draw her the further from the Town, into that of ſetting upon her immediately, ſo that he commanded his men to make up with full fails to the veſſell, and board her, expreſly forbidding any Ordnance to be ſhot off, for fear of loſing that which he meant to preſerve, and that the Caſtle too might not thereby take up an Alarum, and come to the ſuccour of the Princeſs. This was not ſo ſoon ſayd as executed; <hi>Axiamiraes</hi> veſſell was boorded by that of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> who firſt of all leaped into her, for to ſave the Princeſs from perill, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his men, which ſeconded him ſo happily, as the reſiſtance of <hi>Axiamiraes</hi> Guard was in vain; the ſurpriſe and aſtoniſhment wherewith they were ſeiſed, ſerved not a little to make them be ſo eaſily vanquiſhed; for in a quarter of an hours
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60144:60"/> fight they were all ſlain, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> not having above three of his people hurt. But when he would have had the Princeſs remove out of her veſſel into his, ſhe ſhewed more heart than her ſouldiers had done, and encouraging her women to defend themſelves, and to endure rather to be killed, than to let themſelves to be carried away, ſhe advanced towards him with the Dart in her hand, and whatſoever he could do to reſtrain her, being loth to uſe her unworthily in her misfortune, he could not keep her from hurting him in the face: But whereas he ſaw that his reſpect might be the cauſe of his undoing, in retaining him too long in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a place, he commanded four of his ſouldiers to quit their weapons, and take her up in their Arms, and carry her into his veſſell. Then it was when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her uttermoſt indeavour, and that with incredible courage, ſhe would have rid her ſelf out of their hands to have leapt into the ſea; but <hi>Ruſtan</hi> took ſo much care to preſerve her, as he hindred her from it. As ſoon as her women ſavv that their reſiſtance was vain, and that the Princeſs was in <hi>Ruſtans</hi> veſſell, they left deſending themſelves, and out of an affection which cannot be ſufficiently admired, they ſtrove who ſhould firſt paſs into their enemies veſſell, ſo much did they fear to abandon their Miſtreſs, chuſing much rather to be ſlaves with her, than to remain free without her. After this <hi>Ruſtan</hi> held it neceſſary to ſink the Princeſſes veſſell, which was inſtantly done, but he thought it was not fit to caſt the dead bodies into the ſea, for fear leſt ſome of them being driven a ſhoar by the waves ſhould be a ſign that the Princeſs had not ſuffered ſhipwrack, as he deſired it ſhould be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in regard they would be all found full of wounds. He cauſed all the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies then to be carried into his veſſel, with an intention when they ſhould be further off, to throw them over-boord in ſacks half filled with ſome heavy things, which afterwards was accordingly executed. When they had ſunk the Princeſſes veſſell, he commanded his Pilot to ſteer towards <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> and to employ all his skill in making thither with all the poſſible ſpeed he could; he gave order alſo to his ſouldiers to keep themſelves continually ready to fight, and unto two of his men carefully to watch for the diſcovery of whatſoever ſhould appear at ſea, and preſently to advertiſe him of it. This done, he went to the Princeſs, whom they had put into the Captains Cabbin, but he was much amazed to find her in a ſwoon; her ſtriving, and the grief ſhe was in to ſee her ſelf ſo carried away, had ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and oppreſſed her, as ſhe was without pulſe, without motion, and almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. The reſentment which <hi>Ruſtan</hi> ſhewed for it, and the care he took to aſſiſt her, though it was rather the effect of his intereſt than of his pitty, cauſed the Princeſſes women to have ſome comfort amidſt their misfortune: They laboured all of them together then to make her come to her ſelf again; and a little after ſhe aſſured them by a deep ſigh, that ſhe would ſoon be ſenſible of all her miſeries; and accordingly within a while ſhe opened her eyes; but not being longer able to make any reſiſtance, and ſeeing <hi>Ruſtan</hi> by her, whom ſhe knew, though ſhe had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him but once before, and that he had changed his habit, ſhe was conſtrained to have recourſe unto her tears. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> ſeeing her in this eſtate, fell on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her to ask her pardon for the wrong he did her, and to beſeech her to beleeve, that ſo ſad a beginning would have a moſt happy end. He told her likewiſe, that he was not what ſhe thought him to be; that he operated by a more powerfull hand than his own; and that if her grief would permit her to give ear unto that, which might comfort her, ſhe would quickly dry up her tears. This Princeſs ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to anſwer him, ſaid unto him with a low voice, that there was no vvay to comfort her, but to aſſure her, that ſhe ſhould die without the deprivation of her honour and liberty, and without falling into the hands of <hi>Deliment.

                     </gap> unto her then, that he knew not that <hi>Deliment</hi> of whom ſhe ſpake, and proteſted, that far from doing her any violence, he would ſerve her with all reſpect, beſeeching her once again to ſuſpend her grief untill ſhe had learnt the cauſe of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. This cheater ſpake this with a face wherein compaſſion and ſincerity were ſo well painted forth, as ſollicited again by her women, ſhe reſolved to hear him: But he firſt deſired that ſhe would give them order to withdraw a little aſide, to the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60144:61"/> end that none but ſhe might underſtand what he ſaid unto her. She made ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to agree thereunto, but at length ſhe was forced to obey. He recounted to her then, how her unhappineſs was an effect of her beauty; but he did not tell her, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had loved her under the name of <hi>Felixana,</hi> onely he acquainted her that her picture had begot this love, and conſequently the deſign which he had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; howbeit he perceived that <hi>Axiamira</hi> did not beleeve him, ſo that to perſwade her the better, he ſhewed her picture to her, which ſhe preſently knew, and calling her women to her to look upon it, ſhe put them in mind, how the Sophy having cauſed her to be drawn one day with <hi>Felixana</hi> by an excellent Painter, whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had brought into their country, he had commanded many coppies to be made of them, which he had given to Merchants for the publiſhing of her beauty all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and that of <hi>Felixana</hi> whom he infinitely loved. Upon this diſcourſe <hi>Ruſtan</hi> was no longer troubled to conceive, how <hi>Axiamira</hi> had been taken for <hi>Felixana,</hi> eaſily imagining that a Merchant, who it may be underſtood not the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue very well, might be deceived in taking the picture of <hi>Felixana</hi> for that of <hi>Axiami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and that of <hi>Axiamira</hi> for that of <hi>Felixana,</hi> and much the rather, for that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant had got thoſe pictures without ever ſeeing the Princeſs, as we came to know afterwards. But to return to this afflicted fair one, after that <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with the cauſe of her misfortune, he would have inlarged himſelf upon the magnificences of the Seraglio, upon the excellent qualities of <hi>Soliman,</hi> upon the exceſs of the paſſion which he was in for her, and have perſwaded her that her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs would make her happy. But this generous Princeſs, not able to endure a diſcourſe ſo far diſtant from her ſenſe, ſayd unto him with a voice much ſtronger, than the weakneſs wherein ſhe was would ſeem to permit her; do you beleeve then, that a perſon which might have ſucceeded to the Crown of <hi>Perſia,</hi> can reſolve to be the ſlave of <hi>Soliman?</hi> to ſpend her life in priſon? and to have for her companions infamous creatures, who are for the moſt part the refuſe of Pyrates? No, no, <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> came not into the world but to reign, and her death ſhall make it ſoon appear, that ſhe knows not how to obey: Fortune hath put me into your hands, but mine ſhall deliver me out of them. After this ſhe muſed a pretty while very profoundly, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> not daring to anſwer her for fear of further incenſing her; then ſuddenly ſpeaking again, and addreſſing her ſelf to him, Can I hope, ſayd ſhee unto him, for any ſincerity in a man that hath ſo cruelly betrayed me? and can I beleeve that what he hath told me is true? for how can it be imagined that <hi>Soliman,</hi> whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is ſo great and ſo fair, ſhould be capable of cauſing an innocent Princeſs to be forcibly carried away for to make her his ſlave? and how can it yet be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this Prince, who is ſayd to be ſo amorous of a certain <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and who hath loved her ſo long, could be in a paſſion for a picture, yea in ſuch a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as hath obliged him to violate the law of Nations, to forget naturall equity, to outrage a Prince as mighty as himſelf, and to do an act ſo ſtrange as it is without example in all Ages? Tell me then, I conjure you, ſaid ſhe unto him, the true cauſe of my diſaſter, and hide not from me that which time will clear unto me but too well. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> ſeeing her mind a little quieter in all appearance, thought he might gain her by gentleneſs; wherefore he aſſured her with all the artifice that poſſibly he could uſe; how all that which he had told her was true, but how it was true alſo, that the image of the Seraglio, which ſeemed ſo dreadfull unto her, was a meer effect of her grief; that all the grace he would demand of her was no other, but that ſhe would live untill ſhe had ſeen <hi>Soliman,</hi> which favour if he might obtain of her, he was well aſſured, that the ſight of ſo excellent a Prince would make her change her opinion. Yes, ſaid ſhe, interrupting him, I will live, if my grief will permit it; but I will live only to ſeek out the means how to revenge the death, that I will give my ſelf, as ſoon as my complaints and cryes have made ſome one to know the outrage which I have received, to the end that the report thereof being bruited abroad, the Sophy my Father may, by learning the cauſe of my loſs, take ſuch revenge for it, as Heaven doth promiſe me, and which alſo I beg of it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then what I accord to your deſires, in the mean time, if pitty may yet find any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60144:61"/> place in your ſoul, leave me to weep with my women, and refuſe me not the grace that I may be permitted to bewail them for the miſeries which I have brought them to, and to prepare them for my death; but if your inhumanity doth carry you not to grant me this that I deſire, as me-thinks I obſerve in your countenance, remember that birth not depending on fortune, I am ſtill the daughter of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that you are but a Slave, who doubtleſs have nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable in you, than fraud and cunning wherewith to ſerve the violences of your Maſter; get you out of this Chamber then, and enter no more unto it, till the hour of my death be come; for ſurely the rank which I hold doth ordain you to have ſo much reſpect unto me, who commands you unto it. <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who had no other intereſt in the carrying away of this Princeſs, but that of conducting her to <hi>Soliman,</hi> fearing nothing more than to ſee her die before ſhe ſhould arrive at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was affraid in hearing her ſpeak ſo imperiouſly, that ſhe would have fallen into ſome extreme reſolution, if he ſhould have contradicted her, wherefore he went out of her chamber, and aſſured her, that ſhe ſhould ſee by his reſpect, that he had not forgotten what he owed unto her: But firſt he took heed with a great deal of care, not to leave any thing wherewith ſhe might hurt her ſelf, which the perceiving ſaid further unto him, You may take from me iron, fire and poiſon, but not the will to die, and by it I ſhall alwayes find means to execute my deſign: <hi>Ruſtan</hi> would return her no anſwer, knowing full well that ſhe was not in an eſtate to be perſwaded. After this he cauſed her to be ſerved very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully without ever entring into her chamber, yet did he for the moſt part hear all that ſhe ſaid to her women; for fearing leſt ſhe ſhould offer to get out of the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin for to go and caſt her ſelf into the Sea, he lay alwayes at the Cabbin-door, not daring to truſt any body with the guard of a treaſure from whence he hoped for all his fortune. I will not recount unto you the generous and pitifull diſcourſes of this infortunate Princeſs during this voyage, ſince it would but augment the regret, which you will have for her loſs: For, Madam, after a Navigation proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough; after they had paſſed over all the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea by gayning the Coaſt on the left hand; after they had arrived at the River of <hi>Araxes,</hi> which diſimbokes it ſelf into this Sea; had traverſed by Land thorough the whole Countrey of <hi>Colob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

He cauſed then one of the Princeſſes women to be called unto him for to acquaint her with the perill wherewith they were threatned, that ſhe might propound unto her the avoyding of it by the means which I have related; this Maid, who out of the fear of death approved of <hi>

During this conteſtation the Sea was moved in ſuch ſort, as it was out of all probability, had the Princeſs conſented to what they deſired of her, for one to think that ſhe could be ſaved in the Skiff; the tempeſt was ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the ayr ſo obſcured, the thunder ſo loud, the lightning amidſt the darkneſs ſo dreadfull, the waves ſo high, the winds ſo terrible, the rain and hail ſo abundant, and the roaring of the Sea ſo horrible, as it was impoſſible for one to conceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of eſcaping from ſo evident a danger. They were two days beaten in this manner with the tempeſt, and toſſed up and down with the wind and the waves,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60144:62"/> without ceaſing in the mean time to uſe their uttermoſt indeavour to with-ſtand it; but at laſt they were fain to give way to this violence, and refer their lives to the conduct of fortune. Already had the Pilot abandoned the Helm, his Compaſs ſtood him in no ſtead, the Maſt was all to ſhattered, the Sayl-yards torn off, the Tackle rent in pieces, the Veſſell took in water on every ſide, the ſouldiers cried out in deſpair, the Mariners abandoned themſelves to grief, the Princeſſes women were all diſſolved into tears, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> himſelf had almoſt loſt his underſtanding, whenas in the midſt of ſo generall a conſternation he heard the Princeſs cry unto him with a quiet ſpirit, and with a ſetled and confident voyce; at length <hi>Axiamira</hi> ſhall not be a Slave, ſhe ſhall dye with glory, Heaven is armed for her ſuccour, and (if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not my ſelf) her death ſhall be the cauſe of her revenge. Scarcely had ſhe finiſhed theſe words, whenas an hideous wave hitting the Veſſell with an unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable impetuoſity, daſhed it with ſuch violence againſt the point of a Rock, as they ſuffered ſhipwrack in that very place. I will not tell you, Madam, that which <hi>Ruſtan</hi> himſelf could not tell us, for this misfortune was ſo ſudden, as in an inſtant he found, that of all his Veſſell he had nothing left him but a plank which floated to his hand, as he was labouring in the water, and wherewith he ſaved his life by ſuſtaining himſelf upon it; for this man was ſo fortunate, as without other induſtry than ſtrongly faſtning himſelf to this plank, the Sea (which according to its cuſtom retains nothing of all the rapines that it makes) caſt him on the ſhoar, where he remained almoſt in a ſwoon till the tempeſt was over, which was not long firſt; ſo as it might have been ſaid, that this Princeſs had ſerved for an oblation to pacifie the fury of the incenſed waters; for two hours after ſhe had ſuffred ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, the Sun beginning to appear, diſſipated the darkneſs of the night, and the tempeſt, and reſtored calmneſs and tranquillity to the Sea. <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> being wholly come to himſelf again, got up to the ſide of a Rock to ſee if he could diſcover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mark of ſo ſad a wrack, but he could diſcover no other thing than ſome of the Tackle and Planks of his Veſſell, which the waves had brought to Land, ſo that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of any comfort he went to the habitation that was neareſt to the place where he was, and ſtayed there certain days to make ſearch, if at leaſt the body of <hi>Axiamira</hi> might have been found, as alſo to meet with ſome means for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> As for the Princeſs, all his care in vain, he found indeed ſome dead Souldiers and Mariners along the ſhoar, but of her he never could have any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, ſo that the unhappy <hi>Axiamira</hi> is doubtleſs without life, and without ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In the mean time <hi>Ruſtan</hi> thinking of his return, although he were neer to a place where Prince <hi>Gianger,</hi> the youngeſt of <hi>Solimans</hi> ſonnes was reſiding, yet would he not demand any aſſiſtance from him, for fear he ſhould be obliged to tell him a thing which was to be concealed; wherefore he had recourſe to the Governor of a ſmall Town that was not above four miles from thence where he had ſuffred ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, who furniſhing him with all things requiſite for his journey, he returned by Land to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with ſo melancholick a countenance, as at firſt ſight one might eaſily perceive that his enterprize had not been proſperous: I was at that time with his Highneſs, and I have not loſt the remembrance of ſo dolefull a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. As ſoon as <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had made an end of relating to the Grand Signior that which you have heard, he would have excuſed himſelf for having forcibly carried away <hi>Axiamira</hi> without his order, but <hi>Soliman</hi> ſaid unto him with a face wherein grief and choller equally appeared, Speak no further unto me thou baſe and infamous raviſher, and know, that if thou hadſt not maried my daughter <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> thy death ſhould have ſatisfied for that of <hi>Axiamira.</hi> Ah poor Princeſs, ſaid he, how deplorable is thy face! and how unhappy is mine! Then turning himſelf towards me, who was preſent at this mournfull relation, do not reproach me, my dear <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſaid he unto me, for not giving credit to thy counſell, which I remember but too well for my content; and the eſtate wherein I am, puniſheth me ſufficiently for my imprudence: Can any innocent be found more infortunate than I? But what ſay I, innocent (continued he) I cannot be ſo of the death of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; it is I that have delivered her into the hands of <hi>Ruſtan;</hi> it is I that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60144:62"/> her to the tempeſt; and it is I that have been the cauſe of her loſs. Could I be ignorant that ſhe was not an ordinary perſon? No, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> I could not; I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her under the name of <hi>Felixana,</hi> but I was to adore her in my heart as a great Princeſs; I ſaw ſomething ſo high and ſo majeſticall in the air of her face, as I cannot be excuſable for not knowing her; for howſoever, if the poſſeſſion of <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> was neceſſary for my felicity, ſhe was to be intreated after another manner; and if my love would have conſtrained me to have recourſe unto violence, I ſhould have gone in perſon in the head of an hundred thouſand men to make ſo noble a conqueſt with honor; ſhe ſhould have been brought in a triumphant Chariot, and not in the Veſſell of a Traytor and impious man; I ſhould not have thought of poſſeſſing her till I had ſet a Crown upon her head; and if I could not have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her, I ſhould have changed my love into reſpect, and with admiration have looked upon a bliſs that was forbidden me: But <hi>Ruſtan</hi> did not believe that I was capable of ſuch noble apprehenſions, he hath judged of my minde by his own; he thought becauſe he is violent, that I ſhould be wicked; he hoped for a recompence of his crime, and out of an inhumanity which is without example, he hath betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an innocent Princeſs, he hath put a ſtain upon my life which I ſhall not be able to deface, and hath reduced my ſoul to an eſtate never to be comforted. Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his ſpeech to the Princeſs, as if ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Behold, Madam, the Hiſtory of the unfortunate <hi>Axiamira,</hi> all the particulars whereof which I have told you, I learned from <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and more too from one of his ſouldiers, who returned a little after him, and was ſaved almoſt in the ſame manner. <hi>Iſabella</hi> could not then forbear interrupting of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> to lament the misfortune of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> but after ſhe had ſatisfied her compaſſion, ſhe deſired to make an end of contenting her curioſity, and intreated <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> to continue his diſcourſe, which he did in this ſort.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60144:63"/> already to apprehend the end of his narration, and for that cauſe had ſpun out that of the Adventures of <hi>Axiamira</hi> as much as poſſibly he could, in exactly recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her Hiſtory; and all becauſe he was not yet well reſolved whether he ſhould deliver the truth of things to <hi>Iſabella;</hi> in the mean time, whereas ſhe was in much impatience, and that night began to come on, ſhe deſired him not to loſe ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious minutes, but to proſecute his diſcourſe. I would willingly have had you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with me, anſwered <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> for leading you once more to the wars, but ſince you will be acquainted with all my fortunes, I am to let you underſtand, that being abſolutely determined not to wear a Turbant unprofitably for Chriſtendom, I had no other thought but to divert the Arms of <hi>Soliman</hi> from <hi>Hungary,</hi> where I knew he had a deſign to imploy his greateſt forces; the loſs of <hi>Axiamira</hi> furniſhed me ſoon after with means to put ſo juſt a reſolution in effect: For whether it were, that ſome of the Princeſſes women were ſaved by a prodigious good hap, and had acquainted <hi>Tachmas</hi> with the cauſe of the death of his daughter; or that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad, or ſudden departure of <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who had alwayes paſt at <hi>Mazanderon</hi> for a Merchant of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had begotten ſome ſuſpition of the truth, advertiſement came that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was levying a mighty Army: The Truce which had been ſo long between theſe two Princes, could be no obſtacle to this war, for it had never been obſerved exactly; and ſome particulars had often committed acts of hoſtility on either part, ſo that according to the Maxims of State, a plauſible pretext could not be wanting for an Army to march into the Orient, as often as <hi>Soliman</hi> had a mind to it: In the mean time it happened that the <hi>Georgians</hi> having paſt over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> did much ſpoil in <hi>Comagena,</hi> robbing all that went to, or came from <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Sangiacs</hi> of the Province having complained of it, and ſeeing that <hi>Soliman</hi> took no order therein, they paſſed to <hi>Diarbech,</hi> where in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about <hi>Birtha</hi> they did great havock, and rendred that with uſury which the <hi>Georgians</hi> had lent them. This conjuncture ſeeming too favourable unto me to be neglected, I repaired unto <hi>Soliman,</hi> who notwithſtanding the advertiſement he had received that <hi>Tachmas</hi> had put himſelf into Arms, could not be drawn for all that to think of this war; the image of <hi>Axiamira</hi> reigned ſtill in his heart; he could not reſolve to fight with the Father, whoſe daughter he had cauſed to periſh; and if ſome reſentment of glory had not been ſtill remaining in him, I think he would rather have let <hi>Tachmas</hi> invade his Empire, than oppoſe himſelf againſt him. But to ſhew unto you how hardly this Prince was drawn to make a war, which he believed to be unjuſt, I have no more to ſay, than that after I had uſed all my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to remonſtrate unto him, that the war of <hi>Perſia</hi> was a thing no longer in his choice, ſince knowing what his Governors had done in <hi>Diarbech,</hi> and <hi>Tachmas</hi> having an Army on foot, he was not to doubt, yea though he wre ignorant that he was the innocent cauſe of <hi>Axiamiraes</hi> death, but that he would fall upon him; that after I had told him how it was alwayes advantagious for great Princes to begin the War; that it was a mark of love to his Subjects, not to ſuffer the fire to be brought into their houſes; and that I had made him alſo to conſider, that at laſt it would be better to be in an eſtate to ſhew grace to his Enemy, than to receive it from him; that in this occaſion it did not concern his particular glory alone, but that of the Empire; that being innocent of the misfortune of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> he was not to fear that heaven would be contrary to him; and that if this death was to be lamented, it would ſuffice to imploy his tears and ſighs therein, without beholding the blood of his Subjects ſhed. After all theſe things, I ſay, he made no other anſwer, but <hi>Axiamira</hi> is dead for me, I muſt ſacrifice a part of my State for her; and that my Subjects may not murmure at the Conqueſts which I ſhall ſuffer <hi>Tachmas</hi> to gain upon me, I will labor to obtain others of the Chriſtians, without obliging thee, as I have promiſed, to ſerve me therein. I vow unto you, Madam, that this diſcourſe ſurprized me extremely, not knowing which way to oppoſe my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a will ſo fully determined: And that which put me into further deſpair of being able to execute my deſign was, that the Mother and Wife of the Emperour hated me with a ſecret hatred, becauſe I had always favoured <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Gianger,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:60144:63"/> excellent Princes, and the children of <hi>Soliman;</hi> for though this laſt be the ſonne of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> yet leaves ſhe not to hate him, becauſe he loveth <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> This hatred was the cauſe then that theſe two women oppoſed the voyage of <hi>Perſia,</hi> onely to contradict <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, with ſo much addreſs and violence, as I ſtood in need of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary mean to deſtroy all their artifices. The firſt repreſented unto <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that the wars of the Orient had always been infortunate to the <hi>Othomans;</hi> that his Armies would be exterminated with hunger and thirſt, if he carried them to a place from whence his father <hi>Selim,</hi> although victorious, brought back no other advantage, than the loſs of his beſt ſouldiers. As for <hi>Roxelana,</hi> ſhe imployed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but her tears, wherewith alone ſhe was more powerfull than reaſon it ſelf; ſo that all theſe things being joyned to the loſs of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> wrought in ſuch ſort, as I ſaw almoſt an impoſſibility in diverting the ſtorm which was ready to fall on Chriſtendom: But in the end, after I had tried all wayes in vain, I bethought my ſelf, how <hi>Soliman</hi> being mightily perſwaded that Judiciary Aſtrology is a Science which men may practiſe with certainty, I might peradventure bring him to what I deſired, if I could get an <hi>Arabian</hi> to come from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that was an excellent Aſtrologer and Mathematician, called <hi>Mulé Aral,</hi> whom the people accuſed of Magick, by reaſon of the wonders which every day he did; hoping, after I had won him with gifts, to make him ſay unto <hi>Soliman</hi> whatſoever I would have him. I ſent then ſecretly unto <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> not knowing how to meet with any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that could ſatisfie me otherwiſe; and whereas my orders were as well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as the Grand Signiors, it was not long before he was brought to me. In the mean ſpace I was reſolved to ſpeak no more of this war to <hi>Soliman,</hi> untill ſuch time as that which I projected ſhould utterly fail me. As ſoon as <hi>Mulé Aral</hi> was arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I talked with him in private, and after I had ingaged him abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do what I would have him, I diſcovered my deſign unto him, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I covered with the good and glory of the Empire, to the end too he might ſerve me the more faithfully. But this man told me, how he held it fit that the Stars ſhould be obſerved, and his books conſulted with a little about this war, becauſe it might ſo happen, that without any impoſture or lying he ſhould be obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Soliman</hi> to this voyage; and howſoever, though the ſtars did not concur with our intentions, yet would he be ſure to keep his word with me. I parted with him in this manner, having firſt intreated him to make a ſhew of the beſt effects of his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the Port, that ſo the Emperor might give the more credit to that which he was to ſay unto him. <hi>Mulé Aral</hi> failed not in obeying me, for he had not been a week at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but every one ſpoke of the prodigies he did; and whereas he was a great Phyſiognimiſt, he got a world of reputation in a ſhort time. He foretold to ſome that they ſhould die the next day, which failed not to fall out accordingly; to others he revealed the moſt ſecret adventures of their lives; and he was ſo happy, that of all the things which he aſſured, none miſt, or at leaſtwiſe might receive a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable interpretation; ſo that the report hereof being come to <hi>Soliman,</hi> he ſent for <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lé Aral,</hi> who in his preſence told the Baſſa of the Sea ſuch things, as extremely ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him; for he confeſſed, that every particular of that which he had told him, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him accordingly. The grand Signior commanded him to follow him into his Cabinet, where, as I knew afterwards, he declared unto him the moſt ſpecial paſſages of his life, &amp; principally his love to <hi>Axiamira</hi> upon the ſight of her picture, although I had not ſpoken to him of it; ſo as <hi>Soliman</hi> being mightily perſwaded of the Science of this man, asked him whether he thought that the war againſt the Perſians would be proſperous. But <hi>Mulé,</hi> who deſired to finiſh his figures and obſervations, &amp; to give the more weight to that which he ſhould ſay, anſwered <hi>Soliman,</hi> that things paſt were ſeen with more certainty in the phyſiognomy, than things to come; &amp; that for an affair of ſo great importance, he demanded of him only ſix days to ſatisfie him fully: and for the better carrying of the matter, he beſought him to let him know the preciſe point of his nativity, albeit he had been acquainted with it before by me. <hi>Soliman</hi> accorded him his deſire, and having given him leave to depart, reſted ſo ſatisfied of him, as he was already diſpoſed to govern his deſigns by <hi>Mulé Aral</hi>'s anſwer; who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60144:64"/> after he had made his obſervations, came one evening to me with a contented look, and aſſured me, that his Science was falſe, or I ſhould Crown <hi>Soliman</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> It is certain, Madam, that I did not believe the diſcourſe of this man, but onely ſeemed to give credit to his words, to the end I might not diſoblige him, although the ſucceſs of things afterwards made it good. The next day he went to <hi>Soliman,</hi> and with a confident countenance told him, that the war of <hi>Hungary</hi> would prove unlucky to him if he undertook it, but that of <hi>Perſia</hi> glorious; and aſſured him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if he entred firſt into the Enemies Countrey, one of his Slaves, whom he very much loved, ſhould Crown him King of <hi>Perſia. Mulé</hi> accompanied this diſcourſe with ſo many circumſtances, which would be too long to repeat, as at length <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was very ſcrupulous in all things, which he believed came from above, prepared himſelf for this war with as much precipitation, as he had had repugnancy to it before. As ſoon as <hi>Mulé</hi> was gone, he ſent for me, to command me to alter all the directions which he had given, and to cauſe all the Troops to be inrolled for <hi>Perſia:</hi> And whereas this Prince carried an unmeaſurable affection to me, he had charged <hi>Mulé</hi> not to diſcover any thing of that to me which he had ſaid to him, deſiring to make me believe how it was in conſideration of me that he with-drew his Arms from Chriſtendom, thereby to ingage me the more to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Whilſt things were in this eſtate, an accident fell out which began to give great hope of this voyage of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and to confirm <hi>Soliman</hi> in the good opinion which he had of <hi>Mulé Aral;</hi> for it hapned that one <hi>Ulama,</hi> Satrape of <hi>Caramania,</hi> a man of great account with the Sophy, who had maried one of his ſiſters to him, and though ſhe dyed a little after this Mariage, yet did this alliance render him more conſiderable than before. This man, I ſay, having received ſome out-rage from that Prince, after he had ſerved him in divers incounters with the expence of his blood, requeſted of me that I would obtain ſome place of ſafety for him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Solimans</hi> Dominions. I will not tell you, Madam, what this excellent man did in this war, ſince it is certain, that his generous actions doe well deſerve a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in particular; neither will I ſtand to recount this voyage exactly unto you; wherefore, that I may not abuſe your patience, and make the beſt uſe of the reſt of the day, I will only tell you, Madam, that having had a Commandment to conduct the Vant-Guard with <hi>Ulama,</hi> I was ſo fortunate as I ſurprized <hi>Tauris</hi> without any reſiſtance, which at the firſt aſtoniſhed the Enemies, who nevertheleſs left not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves couragiouſly in all other incounters. <hi>Tachmas</hi> performed wonders in his own perſon, and ſo did alſo one <hi>Deliment;</hi> but at length fortune in two ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged battels declared her ſelf for us; ſo that as ſoon as <hi>Soliman</hi> was arrived in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he had almoſt no other imployment than to receive the Deputies of Townes which ſubmitted to his obedience. A part of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> were ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto him, but in ſuch ſort, and ſo abſolutely, that from the Mart of <hi>Balzera,</hi> which ſtands at the mouth of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> entring into the Gulf of <hi>Perſia,</hi> even to the laſt Town, they rendred all unto him. The moſt notable of this great number were <hi>Caramida, Medinum, Orfa</hi> and <hi>Ancefa;</hi> but that which <hi>Soliman</hi> rejoyced moſt at, was the reduction of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> where he was Crowned King of <hi>Perſia</hi> by the hands of the Caliph, who to do me honor, and to teſtifie that I had contributed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the happy ſucceſs of this war, would needs have me ſerve in the Ceremony, and help him to ſet the Crown on the head of <hi>Soliman;</hi> ſo that by this circumſtance nothing was more to be added to <hi>Mulé Arals</hi> Predictions, who at our return was recompenced ſufficiently. After this, his Highneſs beſtowed ſome time in giving directions for all things before his return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he was reſolved to be received in triumph, but a little ſickneſs that he fell into by the way defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this publique rejoycing, which nevertheleſs was performed within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I may ſay that this Triumph was as happy for me, as it was glorious for <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſeeing it was there that I came to know <hi>Doria</hi> in the habit of a Slave, who can recount unto you, Madam, that fortunate dayes paſſage more agreeably than I could. <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> having ſaid this, became ſo confuſed, as if one of the Princeſſes Gentlemen had not advertiſed her, that the Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> accompanied with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60144:64"/> the Marquis of <hi>Touraine,</hi> was come to viſit her in the behalf of the Senate, ſhe had perceived the diſorder of his ſpirit: After ſhe had heard the meſſage that was brought her, ſhe roſe up, and giving her hand to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> ſhe ſaid unto him with a very well ſatisfied countenance, Doe not think to lay upon your friend the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to acquaint me with the reſt of your Adventures, he hath had enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in going to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to juſtifie me unto you, beſides what he is to be at in relating to me that which hath arrived to himſelf in particular; but to let you ſee, continued ſhe, that I am not tyrannicall, I will give you time to content my curioſity, in the mean ſpace I think it fit we ſhould go and receive the Civilities of the Senate: Thir ſaid, ſhe ſuffred her ſelf to be lead in one hand by <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and in the other by <hi>Doria,</hi> whom ſhe had retained as he was about to with-draw, and the reſt of the troop followed after. All the way <hi>Iſabella</hi> continually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the marvellous effects of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s fortune, but in what manner ſoever ſhe conſidered them, ſhe ſtill returned to ſpeak of the obligation wherein he ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>Soliman:</hi> I muſt confeſs, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> that if this Prince be ſuch as you have delivered him, he may be ſtiled the wonder of our Age, and if my Religion did not forbid it me, I would quit my Countrey with joy to live under his Dominion. This diſcourſe made <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> to tremble, but <hi>Doria</hi> laying hold on her ſpeech, confirmed her yet more in the advantagious opinion which ſhe had of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> being come to himſelf again, aſſured her that all which he had ſaid of him was very far ſhort of the truth. This fair Troop enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themſelves in this ſort, untill that being arrived neer to the Caſtle, the Count and the Marquis came to meet the Princeſs, who entertained them with a great deal of reſpect. The Count, to acquit himſelf of the Commiſſion which the Senate had given him, ſaid unto her, that he was not come only to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with her for the happy return of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> but alſo to give her thanks for it, as the moſt important ſervice that ever ſhe could have rendred to the Republique; that this favour from Heaven was doubtleſs due to her vertue, and to the vowes ſhe had made for him, rather than to the deſires of the Senate, who had rendred themſelves unworthy of it; how to teſtifie unto her, that the preſent had utterly defaced the remembrance of the paſt, he intreated her that ſhe would honor <hi>Genoua</hi> with her preſence, whenas ſhe had reſolved upon the triumph of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> to the end that by the pomp and magnificence which they would bring unto it, they might at leaſtwiſe teſtifie their joy, although they could not teſtifie their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement. This diſcourſe made <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> heart to pant, and the Princeſs to change colour; for ſhe underſtood well enough, that the triumph he ſpake of, was to be her mariage. She anſwered with very much modeſty, that generall cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without doubt more favoured of Heaven, than particular intereſts, it was to be certainly believed, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had been reſtored to his Countrey for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory of the Republick; and that having nevertheleſs encountred her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular felicity in this generall happineſs, ſhe had more reaſon to give thanks unto the Senate, than to receive any from them; but, continued ſhe, interrupting <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano,</hi> who would have anſwered that which ſhe had ſaid of him, it will be more convenient for us to enter into the Caſtle for to tell you there what I thinke of it, than to ſtay any longer in a place which the night that is now at hand would render incommodious. The Count then preſented the Marquis of <hi>Touraine</hi> unto her, whom they called at <hi>Genoua</hi> the French Marquis, and aſſured her that he was a man whoſe condition and merit were not unworthy of her knowledge and eſteem. There needs no more, ſaid the Princeſs, to commend and render him agreeable to me, than that he is your friend, and that you eſteem of him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe entertained him with a great deal of curteſie, and the Marquis ſaluting her with very much reſpect, beſought her to judge of him by the Counts opinion, rather than by his own, whenas he ſhould have the honour to be known of her. After this complement, the Princeſs preſented her hand to the Count, and looking on <hi>Juſtiniano, Doria,</hi> and the French Marquis, as though ſhe had been
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60144:65"/> ſorry that ſhe could not ſhare her Civilities amongſt them, univerſall beauties were the object of their entertainment, during the little way that remained for them to goe. The ſituation of this place is ſo delicate, the proſpect of it ſo pleaſant, and the ſetting of the Sun was that evening ſo glorious, with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of vive and rich colours, which the gold of his Rayes imprinted on the Clouds, and reflected on the Sea, as it is not to be thought ſtrange, that a diſcourſe ſo common ſhould make up the converſation of ſuch extraordinary perſons. As for <hi>Doria,</hi> he went along talking to the French Marquis, who led <hi>Aemilia</hi> by the arm, that ſeemed not unpleaſing to him: And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they entred into the Caſtle, where the Princeſs treated them as magnificently, as if ſhe had been prepared of a long time to receive them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Reſently after ſupper the Princeſs, perceiving that the Marquis was gon from the company, demanded of the Count whether it were true that he had brought the French liberty into <hi>Genoua,</hi> as he had formerly told her during the time of her ſolitarineſs. It is ſo true (anſwered the Count) that if you knew in what faſhion we live, you would be ſurpriſed with it; Howbeit your amazement would ceaſe as ſoon as you ſhould know the wit, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and addreſs of the French Marquis. And ſeeing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are not oppoſite to pleaſure, but yet conſerving Vertue with a great deal of reſpect, he was not much troubled to find out followers, both amongſt the men and the Ladies. But is it poſſible (ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>) that he could vanquiſh that jelouſie which is ſo naturall to thoſe of our Nation? He hath for that (replied the Count) made uſe of an artifice, which he alone was able to invent: He obſerved within a little time, after I had made him known to all the perſons of quality, every love in <hi>Genoua,</hi> and wrought ſo well by his addreſs, that in a ſhort while he was the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall confident thereof. When as he ſaw himſelf maſter of all mens ſecrets, he began to perſwade us all in particular to the French liberty; to call us Tyrants over our wives; and to make us comprehend that there was extreme injuſtice in prohibiting converſation unto Ladies, who alone could render it agreeable; That as for him, he was reſolved to make them happy whether they would or no: and for that effect (ſaid he unto us) all they that have ſiſters muſt permit me to ſee and talk with them, to the end that having made them know, how Vertue ought not to be untractable, and how they think more harm when they are by themſelves, than they would do if they knew us more particularly, I may make that ſucceed which I have projected for your advantage. Beſides (ſaid he unto us) this eſſay cannot be dangerous; for whereas I never have an affection that laſts above a week, you need not fear that I ſhall make any great progreſs therein. Each one in particular durſt not refuſe him that which he demanded, as being his confident; ſo that in a ſhort time hee was introduced into all the Houſes of quality, mauger the ſeverity of fathers, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs of mothers. For he hath ſo complying a ſpirit, that he knowes how to take upon him all formes; and for gallantry, no man can be ſo proper for it as he: he ſings very ſweetely; he playes upon the Lute and the Gittern; he daunces with a good grace; he limnes and paints well; he writes excellent letters; he makes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our tongue, as if he were an Italian; and his converſation is ſo intertaining, that it is as impoſſible to be without friendſhip for him, as for him to be without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Whereupon it is eaſie to imagine that he had quickly perſwaded that which he deſired. But to begin the introduction of the thing publiquely, one day when there was a bal, and the company aſſembled together, he approached boldly to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60144:66"/> principall mayds of the Citie; for he feared not ſo much the brothers as the husbands; and told them openly, he was aſhamed for them, that they ſhould be ſeparated from the reſt of the company, as if they were unworthy to be of it: and then hee made a Satyre againſt that cuſtome, which he muſt one day rehearſe unto you. When as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one took delight herein, and that he knew he ſhould be ſupported by all the young folks, and that the Ladies in their hearts wiſhed him no hurt, he deſired all the company, that they would for this evening onely carry themſelves as if they were in <hi>France,</hi> and follow his directions, to the end he might at leaſure make the Ladies ſee, who do not travell, the difference that was between the one and the other. Hereupon all thoſe of his faction cryed it up with a great applauſe, and his advice was followed, although there were ſome that did not allow of it: The women al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made ſome difficulty thereof; but at laſt the Marquis prevailed. He changed then the whole Order of the company, ſaying it was the cuſtome of <hi>France,</hi> that converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be the greateſt pleaſure of a bal; ſo that he played the maſter of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in ſuch manner, as in placing every one, without ſhewing himſelf affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, hee placed each one according to his inclination. After that, it was a good while before he would ſuffer the Violins to play, that the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity might be given to talk; and in this ſort, every one for his particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, found himſelf ſo ſatisfied, as there was not any but avowed, that they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more delight in this aſſembly, than in all the reſt that ever had been. Since that, he hath wrought ſo well with nine or ten intereſſed perſons, as we meet two or three times a week five or ſix families together, where verily he delivers ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things, as cannot be repeated unto you, without loſing much of their grace. It muſt be acknowledged (ſaid the Princeſs) that this is a rare man, and deſerves that I ſhould inform my ſelf by what happy adventure hee hath preferred <hi>Italy</hi> before <hi>France,</hi> for I have heard that he is a man of quality. You have reaſon, Madam (ſaid the Count) to call it happy for us, but it hath not been happy for him, though the end was to him glorious. I beleeve (ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> interrupting him) that her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency would be well contented to underſtand his fortune. And I (replied the Count) to obey her, if I did not fear that the Marquis will not give me leaſure for it, but will come and interrupt my recitall thereof. I am much deceived (ſaid <hi>Doria</hi>) if he doe not give you all the oportunity you can deſire; for I have well obſerved that the faire <hi>Emilia</hi> hath not diſpleaſed him; and that being gone from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was not well, he followed her carefully with his eyes, and if I miſtake not, he is gone to ſeek out ſome occaſion to ſee her, or to premeditate ſome letter, or verſes to expreſs his paſſion. The Count being of <hi>Doriaes</hi> opinion, yeelded to the requeſt which the Princeſs had made him, and began to ſpeak in theſe termes.</p>

                  <head>The Hiſtory of the French Marquis.</head>
                  <p>I ſhall tell you then, Madam, that the Marquis is of an illuſtrious Houſe, and of a Province in <hi>France,</hi> the name whereof is not in my remembrance; and without particulariſing any thing more of his life, than the laſt action which gave him unto us, you are to know that his vertue begot him envie, and conſequently enemies in his country. And whereas he had alwaies lived at court, and in the warres, the late King <hi>Francis</hi> ſhewed him a great deal of reſpect and good will, although hee was as then but very young. He had not been wanting then at the battell of <hi>Pavy,</hi> where he had performed wonders in perſon, and ſo happily for his glory, as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been a witneſs of his valor; yet were there afterwards for all that three Gentlemen in his Country, whereof the one was called <hi>Marsé,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Beniers,</hi> and the other <hi>Dincourt,</hi> amongſt whom fell out a quarrell, occaſioned by the doubt of his valor. <hi>Marsé</hi> had hated the Marquis of a long time, ſo as it is credible, that being unable to finde out any other meanes to deface his glory, hee publiſhed openly, albeit neither he, nor the other two, had ever parted from their houſes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the warre, that the Marquis had fled from the battell of <hi>Pavy.</hi> This diſcourſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60144:66"/> comming to the Kings ear, at ſuch time as the Marquis was not at the Court, nor had heard any thing that was ſpoken againſt him, this Prince, who loved him dearly, thought he ſhould oblige him, it he ſought further into the matter. Hee ſends for <hi>Marsé</hi> then to know of him from whom he had received that which he had reported: <hi>Marsé</hi> anſwers that a Gentleman, named <hi>Dincourt,</hi> had aſſured it unto him, and <hi>Dincourt</hi> appearing ſaid, that contrarily <hi>Marsé</hi> had told him, how he had heard it from one called <hi>Beniers. Dincourt</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Marsé</hi> did not contradict him, beſought the King that he might not bee involved in this affayr; the King grants his requeſt, returns him home, and commands <hi>Beniers</hi> to preſent himſelf, as he does: the King demands of him whether he had told <hi>Marsé,</hi> that the Marquis had fled from the Battell of <hi>Pavy: Beniers</hi> ſtoutly maintaines that he had never ſaid any ſuch thing, and gives the other the lye. The King, who was willing to force two men, who had not been in the warres, to fight, told them, that to diſcover which of them had been the author of this falſhood, he would have them fight a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and that he would honour it with his preſence. They accept of it, and the next day, the liſts being prepared, and the King being placed on a ſcaffold with all his Court, and invironed with a great multitude of people, he ſees <hi>Beniers</hi> appear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a gentleman of his friends; and <hi>Marsé</hi> at the other end of the field brought in by one of his kinſmen. <hi>Beniers</hi> would needs fight with two ſwords, and but half armed; ſo that either of them had a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſlet on with long taſſes, ſleeves of mail, gantlets, a cask on his head, a ſword in his right hand, &amp; another in his left, with each of them a dagger by his ſide. This new ſpectacle drew the eyes of everyone upon them, but at length, after the ſound of trumpets, the oaths, &amp; other ceremonies requiſite in ſuch like actions, they began their combat, wherein they both ſhewed a great deal of adreſs and valour. At the firſt <hi>Marsé</hi> ſeemed to have ſome advantage of the other, he appeared more active, more ardent, and more vigorous; but towards the midſt of the combat it was eaſie to judge, that <hi>Beniers</hi> had made ſpare of his forces to give the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaſure to ſpend his. <hi>Marsé</hi> grew faint, &amp; the other ſo couragious, as no man had ever ſeen one fight more valiantly. They were a long time before they could hurt one another; for it hapned that thoſe two ſwords, which each of them had, and that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried terror by the eyes to the heart of thoſe who beheld two men armed in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were notwithſtanding againſt their intention a meanes to make the combat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; in regard that the left hand ſword ſerved to ward the blowes which they gave one another, aſwell as if each of them had had a buckler. When they perceived that their own armes kept them from deſtroying themſelves, they caſt away their ſwords both at once, and falling a grapling together with a great deal of precipitation they had recourſe to their daggers: But <hi>Beniers</hi> being the ſtronger, and the more delyver, hath <hi>Marsé</hi> down under him, and his hand wherewith he held his dagger being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged under the others, <hi>Beniers</hi> ſeekes for nothing elſe but a place not defended by his cuirace where he might kill him, &amp; already had he his arm lifted up for to ſtabb him, when as the King, who would not loſe a man which had ſhewed ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, threw down his warder in the midſt of the field to make them leave off, which cauſed the people to give a great ſhout for joy, whereat <hi>Benires</hi> turning his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout gave <hi>Marsé</hi> oportunity to disingage himſelf, and in this manner the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority finiſhed their combat. But admire, Madam, the caprichiouſneſs of chance, by this which I am coming to tell you: The Marquis, about whom the quarrell was, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in poſt at the very ſame Towne, where the combat was fought; he askes where the King is? and whereas the people are never well informed of things, he is only told, that he is beholding a combat, which he hath permitted unto two Gentlemen, who had required it of him. This novelty touches him with curioſity; he goes without further inquirie, or any thought that he had any intereſt in this affair: he comes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee beholds the combat a while amongſt the multitude, makes vowes for <hi>Marsé,</hi> whoſe demeanor and perſonage pleaſed him, wiſhes againſt his own proper intereſt that he may carry away the victory, and without knowing it takes his enemies part. But one of his friends having perceived him, approaches to him, and in few words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>counts him the whole matter, and withall poſſeſſes the mind of the Marquis with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60144:67"/> ſhame, deſpight, and fury. There is one then (ſaid he unto him that had acquainted him with this bad newes) which dares accuſe me of cowardiſe; and even the King, who knowes full well whether I fled from the battell or no, in ſtead of puniſhing this Impoſtor, does him the grace to permit him the combat; renders himſelf judge of it, is ready to heap glory on him, and to declare him victor if he ſurmounts his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. No, no, I cannot ſuffer it, and I muſt caſt my ſelf diſarmed as I am, into the midſt of the liſts; I muſt fight with them both together, or aſunder, it matters not which, ſo as I may be revenged, or die gloriouſly. As he was in this reſolution the King threw down his warder to make the combat ceaſe; and though the Marquis his minde was much troubled, yet had he obſerved that <hi>Beniers</hi> was in a condition to be victorious over his enemy, at ſuch time as the King had given that ſignall of peace; which put him into ſuch ſtrange choler, as hee reſolved to break through the preſs, to goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf, and in perſon demand ſatisfaction for the outrage had been done him by ſo black a calumnie. What (ſaid he to himſelf, in ſeeking ſtill to approach neerer) the King takes care for the life of a man that ſpoyles me in my honour! hee hath not permitted the combat then, but out of hope that my enemy would vanquiſh, ſince aſſoon as it appeared that he had the worſt, he retayned the hand of him that would have ſtabbed him, and ſaved the other from the puniſhment which he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive: But it is juſt that he ſhould periſh by my hand; and that I ſhould be revenged by my relf. In the mean time the preſs was ſo great, and the people ſo thronged together for to hear what the King ſaid to <hi>Marsé</hi> and his adverſary, as the Marquis could not come neer him, till he had told them, that their courage had obliged him from having either of them acknowledged for the calumniator: and that in perſuance of this grace he commanded them to publiſh every where, how they knew from his mouth, that the Marquis had been one of the formoſt in the front of the battell; that he had been one of the laſt which he had ſeen fighting about him; and that if all the reſt had done their devoir aſwell as he, he had not loſt his liberty. Then turning himſelf to the principall perſons of his Court, I am (ſaid he) a witneſs of that which I ſay; and if any one dare make any doubt of my ſpeech, I will make him feel what the diſpleaſure of an incenſed Prince is. The Marquis ſeeing the King leave off ſpeaking, caſt himſelf at his feet, and ſurpriſed in ſuch ſort, both the Court, his enemies, and the King himſelf, as it was a good while before hee could be heard, ſo great was the murmure. But at length, after the people had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſilence, the Marquis ſpake to him much after this manner. I know very well, Sir, ſince your Majeſtie is ſatisfied of my courage, that I ſhould be ſo too; but it is not ſufficient for your glory, that they whom you favour ſhould be valiant, they ought alſo for the juſtifying of your judgement to be thought ſuch by all the world; And therefore (if I may be permitted to ſpeake ſo) I cannot indure that they, who have traduced me two hundred leagues from the battell, ſhould not by experience undeſtand, that I know not how to recoil, either in a generall, or particular combat: Grant me then out of juſtice that, which you have granted out of grace to mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; your equity and your glory is concerned herein, and you cannot refuſe me the combat which I demand, without covering me with ſhame and confuſion. The King having attentively heard him, ſaid, that his reſentment was noble, but he could not for his own glory accord him that which he deſired: That the publique teſtimony which he had given of his valour, was more glorious than the death of his enemy, who by his commandment would be conſtrained to publiſh all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the contrary of that which he had reported; That if he ſhould permit him the combat, he ſhould ſeem to poſterity, that he himſelf had made doubt of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; that it would be to equall him with his enemy, which by no means he would do, neither was it juſt he ſhould. The Marquis, hearing the King ſpeak after this ſort, was ſo ſeiſed with ſpight and grief, as he could not anſwer him. In the mean time the King, adviſing with the chiefeſt of his Court about what ſatisfaction he might give the Marquis, never heeded his going away; for ſuddenly thruſting himſelf amongſt the preſs, he did ſo, as before he could be followed he took poſt, and went and hid himſelf in one of his friends houſe, forty Leagues off, with an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60144:67"/> intent not to ſtir from thence but to be revenged. The King was much offended with this action of his, and although he loved the Marquis exceedingly, yet his authority ſeeming to be contemned thereby, he teſtified a great deal of diſpleaſure for it. He charged <hi>Marsé</hi> not fight with him, and yet commanded him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge every where, how that which he had ſaid was falſe. This while the Marquis cauſed his enemy to be obſerved, and received news of whatſoever paſſed at Court; and whereas he hath a great and generous ſpirit, the alteration of the Kings favour towards him touched him ſo ſenſibly, as he deſired his friends not to think of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him thereunto: He took order ſecretly for his affairs, ſetled his eſtate, raiſed a maſs of mony, great enough to undertake a long voyage; and that done, reſolves to fight, not only with <hi>Marsé,</hi> but alſo with <hi>Beniers,</hi> not knowing, ſaid he, whether he had not ſpoken that which he diſavowed; and after all, to quit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever. But the latter gave him not leave to execute his deſign; for he died of ſickneſs. As for <hi>Marsé,</hi> as ſoon as he knew that he was returned into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he ſent him a challenge; whereunto he anſwers, that in regard of the Kings charge to the contrary, he could not accept of it. The Marquis netled with this refuſall, reſolved to force him to fight; and watching for him a good while after in a Wood, that was not far from <hi>Marsés</hi> houſe, and whither he went oftentimes to walk, he perceived one morning a Provoſt-Marſhall, accompanied with two of his fellows, who came along thorough the Forreſt; he hid himſelf for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and heard that one of them named him, and ſaid that the King would have him apprehended if he could be found. This diſcourſe obliged him to follow them afar off; but he was much aſtoniſhed when he ſaw them enter into <hi>Marsés</hi> houſe: whereupon he no longer doubted, but that it would be impoſſible for him of a long time to find an opportunity to fight with him. He informs himſelf more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the buſineſs; remains certain daies about this houſe, and at length learns, that the Provoſt-Marſhall was ſent to <hi>Marsé</hi> to apprehend him; for the King had been advertiſed both of his retreat, and of the time when he departed to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Country; So that oppreſſed with many misfortunes, he reſolved to go and paſs away certain moneths in ſome other place, hoping that in the mean time they might peradventure be wearied with continuall guarding of <hi>Marsé.</hi> He went then into <hi>Provence</hi> for his more ſecurity, where one of his particular friends lived, that was retired from the Court. Being there, he underſtands that the Kings diſpleaſure is pacified, and that his enemie is dead; ſo that the impoſſibility which he ſaw to be revenged, makes him take the reſolution never to appear again at a Court, whoſe Prince had not intreated him very vvell. He paſſeth into <hi>Italie,</hi> as being Maſter of his Actions and Eſtate; and after he had ſeen all that is remarkable on this ſide the mountains, he ſtaied in the end at <hi>Genoua,</hi> vvhere ſuch pleaſant things have arrived unto him, as one vvould hardly beleeve they vvere true, they vvere ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. You have much obliged me, ſaid the Princeſs, by acquainting me vvith all theſe paſſages; but I vvould fain knovv, vvhat cauſe <hi>Marsé</hi> had ſo to hate him? I rather think Madam (replyed the Count) that there was ſome love in the quarrel; if I be not deceived, <hi>Marsé</hi> had four ſiſters, and the Marquis but one; and they were both neighbours together in the country, ſo that viſiting one another very often, according to the cuſtom of <hi>France, Marsé</hi> fell in love with the Marquis his Siſter, and the Marquis, who alwaies returns Love with uſury, became enamoured of all his four at once. He loved the eyes of the one, the ſtature of the other, the voyce of the third, and the wit of the laſt. And in theſe four mayds, he ſaid that he had the moſt accompliſhed Miſtris in the world. This folly laſted long enough to give <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sé</hi> leaſure to become deſperately in love with the Marquis his ſiſter, who at her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intreaty had entertayned him very civily during certain moneths that he was away in the Province, albeit ſhe could by no meanes indure him. In the mean while the time of his return being come, <hi>Marsé</hi> begins to think ſeriouſly of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, beleeves they will ſucceed well; and finding that the Marquis took great delight in reſorting to his houſe, thinks to give him the choiſe of his four ſiſters, and by that exchange hopes to eſtabliſh his felicity, and poſſeſs his Miſtris. He
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60144:68"/> imployes one therein, who was a friend both to him and the Marquis; gives him order to diſcover which of his Siſters he hath a mind to, that he may prepare her to intertain him the better. This friend acquits himſelf dexterouſly of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he repairs to the Marquis, ſpeakes to him of <hi>Marsés</hi> Siſters, and demands of him which of them pleaſeth him moſt. He anſwers, that they pleaſe him all alike; that the eldeſt is plump, fair-hayr'd, white-skin'd; that ſhe hath a great deal of ſweetneſs in her eyes, and in her humour, but that it is great pity ſhe is no taller. This man, who was called <hi>Alſac,</hi> beleeved that this was ſhe which touched the Marquis his heart, ſince he found but this little defect in her. But the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on in his diſcourſe, he thought it was the ſecond; for (ſaid the Marquis) the advantagious ſtature of the next; that ſtately look; that dark hair; that ovall viſage; and that noble pride, which appears in her port and all her actions, would render her incomparable, were her complexion ſomewhat clearer, and that ſhe ſpake a little more than ſhe does. I was deceived (ſaid <hi>Alſac</hi> then) and it is this ſame that hath vanquiſhed him. But (continued the Marquis) the mouth of the third; her white teeth; that quaintneſs which ſhe hath in the ayr of her face; that merry and joviall humour; and that which goeth beyond all the reſt, that charming and paſſionate voice, which ſhe governs with ſo much art, gives her ſuch a grace, as would make her ſurmount all hearts, were it not for a little inequality of humour that appears in her. Nay now I know not which of them it is, ſaid <hi>Alſac</hi> to himſelf; but for the laſt (continued the Marquis) it muſt be acknowledged, that that freſh and vermilion hew, proceeding from her youth, which may be named the ſoul of beauty; thoſe ſparkling eyes; that black hair; that comely neck; that mean and well proportioned ſtature; thoſe white hands; and that which is moſt marvellous in the age of fifteen yeares, that nimble wit, which renders her the entertainment of a company; which makes her talk very agreeably of all matters; and which puts a particular charm into every part of her; deſerves almoſt the whole heart of a worthy man, if ſhe did not live in the Country, and had but for ſix moneths onely breathed the air of the great world: but that originall ſin which takes off much of her value, and the ſole thought that ſhe is a country Gentlewoman, is a ſoveraign preſervative for a man of the Court. <hi>Alſac</hi> was then very much perplexed; howbeit he conceived that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle which the Marquis brought to this laſt, was the leaſt conſiderable; and that thereby he would conceal his paſſion. But this conjecture was not for all that ſo ſtrong, as he durſt ſettle his judgement on it, as on an indubitable thing. He preſſes the Marquis yet in another manner, and preciſely demands of him, whether he be in love or no; the Marquis, who thought he was not to ſpeak ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, anſwers, that he is, more than all the men of the world; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats him to tell him with whom; and the Marquis, who believes that this man hath no hidden deſign, is contented to tell him, for to keep him ſtill in doubt, that it ſufficeth he aſſures him, how in that which he loves, all the beauties of the body, and all the graces of the mind, are incountred; and that a maſter-peece of Nature might be made of it, if one could ſee together, what he loves aſunder. <hi>Alſac</hi> comprehended nothing by this diſcourſe, although it were true in the Marquis his ſence, who indeed was in love with theſe four maids; in each of which he found things that touched his heart, and others that did not pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>This man then being in diſpair of being able to acquit himſelf of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, enquires howſoever, whether it be at Court, or in the Country, that he loves? The Marquis anſwers, how it is in the Coutry that he loves, and after this they part. <hi>Alſac</hi> goes to <hi>Marsè,</hi> and tels him that all the fruit of his voyage is, how he certainly knows that the Marqueſs is in love in their Country, and that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt be in his houſe, ſince there were no other Gentlewomen thereabout; but to underſtand preciſely which of his Siſters held the chiefeſt place in his heart, was impoſſible for him to diſcover, ſo well had he ſpoken to him of all four; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it ſeemed to him that the laſt touched him a little more than the reſt; but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60144:68"/> this too was ſo uncertain, as he counſelled him not to rely on it. <hi>Marsé</hi> finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hereupon ſufficiently troubled, howſoever he reſolvs to clear himſelf therein, and beleeves that entertaining all his Siſters, one by one in particular, he may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the truth; it being impoſſible, ſaid he, but that I ſhall obſerve by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, to which of them he hath ſpoken ſeriouſly of love. He ſends for the eldeſt to him into his Cabinet, ſpeaks to her with a great deal of teſtimony of good will, and to oblige her the more eaſily to diſcover her heart unto him, he aſſures her that he thinks of nothing with more care, than to eſtabliſh her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; that he ſhould hardly reſolve to marry before her; and at length, having made a turn or two, he demands of her whether the Marquis had ever given her any particular proofs of his affection, and whether that match would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto her. This propoſition having made her bluſh, ſhe anſwers, caſting down her eyes, that in this occaſion ſhe had no other will but his, and that ſhe was ready to obey him. How it was true, that the Marquis had teſtified that he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed her, and that in an hundred encounters he ſtill ſeemed to prefer her before the reſt; and that ſhe alſo had known how to acknowledge his merit to the prejudice of them that came neer him; but that for three or four dayes ſince he had applyed himſelf more in talking to the third than he was accuſtomed to do. This Maid giving no further marks in this diſcourſe of the love the Marquis bore her, than that which ſhe bore to him by the jealouſie which ſhe ſhewed, <hi>Marsé</hi> was at a nonplus; he perceives by his Siſters ſpeech, that the Marquis had ſpoken to her of love; that ſhe did not hate him; and that ſhe ſuſpects notwithſtanding that he hath a mind to her which ſings, although according to <hi>Alſacs</hi> opinion it ſhould be to the youngeſt. Howbeit he conceals his unquietneſs from his Siſter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to ſound them all, charging this not to ſpeak a word to the reſt of what had paſt between them. She withdraws, and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ond arrives with a look and a modeſty that made him beleeve he ſhould be much troubled to draw any thing out of her concerning that which he deſired to know. But he was much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, when as at the firſt propoſition which he made to her of it, ſhe freely told him, but with ſome little preparation before hand, that ſhe beleeved the Marquis loved her eldeſt as a Siſter; that he delighted to hear the third ſing; that the wit of the laſt did not diſpleaſe him; but as for her, ſhe thought that he had given her ſuch tokens of his eſteem of her, as he had given to none of the reſt; and that he had at ſundry times ſpoken to her in that manner, as ſhe could no longer doubt of it. Howbeit, that for three or four dayes laſt paſt, ſhe thought that to ſpight her, or to make her more favourable unto him, he had cauſed one of her Siſters to ſing more, and had eyed the youngeſt more than he uſed to do. That as for her, ſhe could alwayes rule her will by his, but if he would permit her to ſpeak the truth, ſhe muſt confeſs unto him, that ſhe could be contented to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with a Courtier, being ſo ſtrongly diſ-inclined from the Country, as ſhe could hardly reſolve to talk with them that came to viſit her. Her Brother promiſes to doe what he can to content her, and having charged her to be ſecret, he diſmiſſes her, and ſends for the third. What ſhall I make of all this (ſaid <hi>Marsé</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) I cannot learn yet whether the Marquis be truly in love or no, however I am ſure that I have two Siſters which are already deſperately in love with him, but it may be, continued he, that the other two will clear this <hi>enigma</hi> unto me. In the mean time ſhe whom he had ſent for appears with her jocund humour; ſhe demands of him at the firſt daſh, whether it were to propound a Lover unto her that he had ſent for her ſo in ſecret; he anſwers her, that ſhe was not deceived, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was to ask of her whether the affection of the Marquis did ſatisfie her? She replyes laughing, that the obligation which ſhe had unto him for having taught her ſo many excellent ayrs, for having taken ſuch pains to make her ſing well, and to tune her Lute to her voice, deſerved that her anſwer ſhould be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto him. But, ſaid <hi>Marsé</hi> to her, ſpeak ſeriouſly, for though you be the third, yet if the Marquis loves you, you ſhall be the firſt married. Can you doubt of it, ſaid ſhe? and ſee you not that the conformity which is between us
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60144:69"/> muſt needs produce a fair affection? He is merry, I am not melancholick; he underſtands muſick, and I can ſing; he plays on the Lute, and ſo doe I; he dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces admirably, and I doe not dance with an ill grace; in concluſion, there is a kind of I know not what inviſible thing, called, as I think, Sympathy, which makes us that we cannot hate one another. I but, replied <hi>Marsé,</hi> this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and you muſt tell me more ſeriouſly whether he loves you. Expect not any thing more ſerious from me, ſaid ſhe, for I ſhould ceaſe to be that I am, and peradventure ſhould not pleaſe the Marquìs, if I were wiſer; wherefore be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let me tell you only, that if he ſpeaks to you with as good a grace when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me of you, as he did in diſcovering his paſſion unto me, I ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him cruelly. After this ſhe went away ſinging a Song which the Marquis had made for her, and left <hi>Marsé</hi> ſo confounded, as he could ſcarcely beleeve what he had heard. But at length the laſt arrives, and whereas he knows that ſhe had more wit than the reſt, he alſo imployes more art in ſpeaking to her: He cajols and carreſſes her; calls her his Favourite, and his deareſt Siſter; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an hundred proteſtations of good will, conjures her to deal ingenuouſly with him; and to oblige her the more, confeſſes unto her, that he is in an extreme paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Marquis his Siſter; and beleeving that he is ſo too for her, he deſires her to tell him the truth of it, and if it be ſo, to uſe him kindly, for fear he ſhould oblige his Siſter to oppoſe his affection. She anſwers thereunto with a great deal of wit, that ſhe would think her ſelf infinitely happy to be ſacrifiſed for the felicity of her Brother; but as for that which concerned the Marquis, ſhe was to tell him, that her life had not yet been long enough to be able to diſcern a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affection from a true; that it was ſo little a while ſince one had given over intreating her like a Girl, that ſhe durſt not as yet rely on her judgment; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was true, the Marqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> had taken ſome ſuch particular care of her, as made her think he did not wiſh her ill; and whereas he was the firſt worthy man that had ſpoken civilly unto her, ſhe confeſſed freely unto him, ſhe could not chuſe but be obliged to him for it; but that therein ſhe promiſed to follow his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exactly. The addreſs of this maid was not ſuch, but that her Brother percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the change of her countena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce that the Marquis pleaſed her more than ſhe made ſhew of: But whereas he deſired to have the liberty to think of ſo ſtrange an adventure, he ſends her away, injoyns her to be ſecret, and aſſures her that he will alwayes teſtifie that ſhe is dearer to him than his other Siſters. When ſhe was gone, he fell a walking up and down (for the Marquis knew all theſe things afterward by the third of theſe Gentlewomen, who out of the conformity that was betwixt them continued ſtill his friend, maugre all their diſorders) and having been a while without ſpeaking; What, ſaid he, the Marquis ſhall make my four Siſters be in love with him, whilſt himſelf peradventure is not taken by any of them, and I ſhall be ſo unhappy as not be able to touch the inclination of his one? He will laugh in his mind at his conqueſts, and my misfortune; and whilſt to the prejudice of my houſe he ſhall be laden with the favours of four maids, I ſhall get but cold civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from her, whom I love paſſionately, and that alone can make up my felicitie. But, continued he, what counſell can I take? If I have recouſe to violence; if I quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with him; if I fight with him, and will make him explain himſelf by force, for the intereſt of my Siſters, then I ruine my ſelf with her; I loſe the hope of ever poſſeſſing her; and it would be an ill way for one to prove his love unto a generous perſon, to kill her Brother. It is better for me then to diſſemble a while; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all his actions; to endeavour yet to diſcover whom the Marquis is in love withall; and if at laſt I can learn nothing certain, then to propound unto him the choice of my Siſters, in demanding of his. Behold in what ſort <hi>Marsé</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with himſelf about ſo intricate an affair (at leaſtwiſe he hath recounted it ſince in this manner.) But as <hi>Marsé</hi> was thus troubled at home, ſo was the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis in ſome ſort with his Siſter, who having another deſign with her ſelf than the marrying of <hi>Marsé,</hi> would have him diſpenſe with her for entertaining him any longer, and permit her to take all hope from him. Howbeit the Marquis,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60144:69"/> who could not endure that his Siſters rigour ſhould deprive him of the favours of all <hi>Marsés,</hi> unto whom he durſt not have gone any more, if once ſhe ſhould have put him into deſpair, could not conſent unto her deſires. Why, Siſter, ſaid he unto her, you ſee me to be an hundred leagues from the Court, in a ſolitary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where one can hardly behold any thing that ſo much as reſembles a woman, and you will be ſo cruell as to deprive me of a company, wherein I meet with four very amiable ones; ſo as if it be true that the loſs of one Miſtreſs brings an unquietneſs that cannot be ended but by Iron or Poyſon, what doe you think will become of me, when you ſhall have taken from me four at a time, which I love paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately; and in a place where I can find no others? If I were at <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with you herein, not onely for fower, but for thirty, being well aſſured that I ſhould repair this loſs in a little time: But in the midſt of a deſert to deprive me of four ſole maides whom I can love, is ſo great an inhumanitie, in the humor wherein I am, as if you conſider it ſeriouſly you muſt needs repent you of it. But, anſwered his Siſter laughing, you doe not love them, for how can you ſhare your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many? Not love them (replyed the Marquis) naughty Siſter, come, you doe not know me, if you believe as you ſay; for it is moſt certain that I love them with all my ſoul; and that in all my life I never found my ſelf ſo conſtant, nor ſo amorous. And whereas this maid could not very eaſily comprehend, how a man could love four at once, and tearm himſelf conſtant: for to make her underſtand it, he told her, that by a very extraordinary adventure he had no great affection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or any of them in particular, but meeting in theſe four perſons ſeparately, with that, which he would have in one alone, he was ſo deſperately in love therewith, as he was never in ſuch a paſſion before. He told her further, that ordinarily when he found any thing that was amiable in a woman, he excuſed the defects which were in her, and became in love with all her perſon; but that in this incounter, through a caprichiouſneſs of love, he was wounded in another ſort. For, ſaid he ſeriouſly, it would be impoſſible for me, in the eſtate wherein my mind now is, to love any of thoſe maides ſingle; and I am never more joyfull than when I ſee them all four toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I behold the whitneſs of the firſt; the look of the ſecond; I hear the voice of the third; and admire the gentleneſs of the laſt. In concluſion, I am ſo ſatisfied with this manner of loving, that when I could, by an unheard-of miracle, take from thoſe four maides all that doth pleaſe me in them, to make thereof a Maſter-piece and a mervail, ſuch as I may imagine, yet ſhould I rather chuſe to love them as I doe. For if I ſhould love but one of them, I ſhould be without conſolation when ſhe were in choler; whereas contrariwiſe I am never altogether unhappy: if I have angred the fair one, the brown one regards me favourably; and if I am out with the ſerious one, the merry one comforts me with her jocund humor; and when it falls out, that I am upon good tearmes with all the four, I have ſuch delight as cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. One prepares a bracelet for me, another ties a band about my hat, a third gives me powder and eſſences, whilſt the fourth cauſes her picture to be drawn for the love of me. In purſuance hereof, I ſing a ſong that is agreable to all four, which each of them applies to their own particular for a mark of my affection, and which they all commend with addreſs and joy: and that which is yet more worth than all theſe things, is, that this paſſion is ſo fair and ſo extraordinary, as the end of it can never be unhappy. For when as I my ſelf would contribute to mine own ruine, it is impoſſible that ever I ſhould arrive to that infortunate terme, which for the moſt part finiſhes all loves, I mean marriage. If I ſhould love one of theſe maides, it may be that utterly loſing all reaſon againſt my cuſtom, I ſhould alſo mary her; but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe four ſiſters as I doe, unleſs the Law ſhould permit me to mary them all four, as the Turkes does, I am in no danger of being their husband. In this manner I ſhall be alwaies free, and alwaies amorous; and the impoſſibilitie that there is for them ever to be my wives, gives them a charm, which will make me love them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I return again to the Court. Judge now after this, cruell ſiſter, whether you are to rob me of all my pleaſures. You knovv, continued he, that I doe not croſs yours, that I have never preſt you to hearken to the ſighes of <hi>Marsé,</hi> more than vvas need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60144:70"/> for my diverſion, and not to conſtrain you to marry him. I am ſo much a friend of liberty, that I cannot endure the leaſt violence, either in my ſelf, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and if you reſiſt me never ſo little more, I feel that I ſhall doe what you would have me; but at the very ſame inſtant I ſhall take Poſt to goe ſeek out ſome new object for my paſſion, without vvhich I am not able to live. They vvere a long time yet pleaſantly diſputing on either part concerning this matter; but at laſt the Marquis his Siſter, vvho vvould not loſe ſo favourable an occaſion to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto her Brother the deſign vvhich ſhe had, gives him to underſtand, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abſence, a Gentleman of their Neighbours, extreme rich, of great courage, and of much ſpirit, had fallen in love vvith her; and that he being to return from the Army in a ſhort ſpace, ſhe vvas afraid leſt ſome miſchief might fall out betvveen him and <hi>Marsé.</hi> It is not that I have any affection for him, ſaid this Maid, but I muſt confeſs to you, that I vvill never mary <hi>Marsé,</hi> though I think I could reſolve to be the others Wife. Come, my dear Siſter, anſvvered the Marquis, doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe your thoughts; ſay that you are in love; that your paſsion is violent, and vvith theſe charming vvords you ſhall obtain of me all that you can deſire; I vvill return to the Court eight dayes ſooner than I vvould have done, to leave you the liberty to uſe <hi>Marsé</hi> as you pleaſe; but vvhen I goe I vvill leave our Mother an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute povver to mary you according to your ovvn mind; for I am ſo glad to ſee that you are not inſenſible, that I love you for it far more than I did. As they vvere thus talking, <hi>Marsé</hi> arrives, the Marquis hides himſelf againſt his Siſters vvill, gets out at a back-gate, mounts on horſ-back, and rides to <hi>Marsés</hi> houſe, vvhich vvas not far off, vvhere he finds thoſe four fair Siſters, or to ſay better, his four Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, all of them more joviall than ordinary, for they had every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſome hope to be the Marquis his Wife, by reaſon of the propoſition their Brother had made to them of it. They had alſo attired themſelves extraordinarily, to give him new wounds; for they knew well no day paſt without his viſiting them. The eldeſt had a garment on of green cloth-of-Silver, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reof the ſleeves were tyed up with carnation-ſilver'd ribbon, and her hair with the ſame, which did not misbecome a perſon fair-complexioned. The ſecond had on a night attire of pure white ſilver tinſell, which gave a kind of luſtre to her ſerious and modeſt aſpect; the third alwayes glittering, was in a waſtcoat of gridilyon ſattin, ſet all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with ſilver oes; as for the youngeſt, though her garment was plainer than the reſt, yet was it the gallanteſt; her habit was nothing elſe but ſilverd tiffany, imbroidered with flowers, lined with carnation taffata, and her head was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with carnation and white feathers, which muſt needs doe well with a young perſon, whoſe hair was black, complexion clear and lively, and eyes wonderfully ſparkling. All theſe Siſters were much amazed in themſelves, at the care which each of them had taken on one and the ſame day, in ſetting forth themſelves as much as poſſibly they could; and the Marquis was ſo ſurpriſed to ſee them all at once with ſuch magnificence and jollity, that he could not imagine what ſhould be the cauſe of it; for commonly they obſerved this order amongſt themſelves, that there was one alwayes careleſly dreſt, to the end that each of them in their turn might ſhew, both affected handſomneſs, and handſome careleſneſs. But at length the Marquis accoaſts them, divides his complements and looks, commends them all four together, and without knowing what was in their thoughts, does things which confirms them in their opinion. He talks to them of love openly, ſwears that he is in ſuch a paſſion for them, as he was never in the like before; and whereas their minds were prepoſſeſſed, they beleeve that it is an addreſs of Court to ſpeak overtly of theſe matters, and to leave it to her, whom one loves, to apply it to her ſelf. She whom he beheld beleeved, that it was as much as to ſay, it is for you; and thoſe whom he did not behold, beleeved, that out of reſpect he durſt not encounter their eyes, in ſpeaking of a thing which might make them bluſh; in fine, they were all very well contented and very well ſatisfied. The Marquis, who did not love to make unprofitable viſits, demands new favours of them; he will have a bracelet made of the hair of all four; they laugh at it at firſt; they refuſe him, or to ſay
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60144:70"/> better, they make him the more earneſt to intreat them for it; and at laſt they grant it him, ſtill in the thought, that it is a trick whereby he will get the hair of her eh loves, without making ſhew that it ſhould be a particular favour, or that ſhe ſhould have cauſe to be offended at it. This promiſe was ſoon executed; the youngeſt of theſe maids being the moſt dextrous, was ſhe that plaited this hair together, and made a bracelet of it, where the different colour of their hair appeared all aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In labouring at this work, ſhe laughed in her ſleeve, to think how her Siſters were beguiled, if they beleeved that it was for them the Marquis had deſired that which ſhe was making; and the reſt, who thought they were more cunning, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſimplicity of their younger Siſter, for taking ſuch paines about a thing wherein ſhe had ſo ſmall a ſhare. And thoſe ſeverall concealed opinions which they all had, gave them ſo ſtrong a diſpoſition to laugh, as upon the leaſt pretext for it, they fell into it; finding too amidſt their laughter occaſion to redouble it, each of them beleeving in their mind, that the reſt would not alwayes laugh with ſo good a will when once the Marquis ſhould declare himſelf. As for him, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſt time, after he had ſpoken to them all in generall, according to the French liberty, he ſpake to them in particular; he ſingles out one into a corner of the room, and there ſayes gallantries to her; a little after he talkes with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at a window, which looks upon the garden, and ſeeming to admire the beauty of the flowers, he praiſes that of her eyes; he accompanies the youngeſt when ſhe goes forth, and makes uſe of this occaſion to cajoll her. And when they walk in the garden, he ſometimes draws one of them alſo from the reſt, that he may be able to ſpeak two or three words to her in private, or to kiſs her hand. In the mean time, <hi>Marsé,</hi> who had not received ſuch careſſes at the Marquis his houſe, returns to his own, where he finds him ſtill to be; he does what he can to make him ſtay all night, but the Marquis, who began to fear leſt <hi>Marsé</hi> ſhould preſs him to explain himſelf, withſtands it, parts from this fair company, carries away the bracelet, and comes back to his Siſter, who was very melancholick. For it had happened, that her Lover being returned, had ſurpriſed her talking with <hi>Marsé;</hi> and whether he had underſtood of his deſign, or that ſhe had before acquainted him with it, they had ſaluted one another very coldly, and had talked as men that took pleaſure to contradict each other. So that, ſaid ſhe to the Marquis, after ſhe had recounted unto him that which had befallen, I ſee the matter in a caſe to break forth, and ſuddenly to produce ſome miſchief, if we doe not look to it in time. No ſuch thing, anſwered the Marquis, for whereas I have promiſed nothing to <hi>Marsé,</hi> and that he too hath not ſpoken to me of his love to you, or of any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had to marry you; I may tell him if he moves me about it, that I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to another, and to make that true, cauſe your Lover to come to me, and I will promiſe him my conſent. I know that thereby I ſhall baniſh my ſelf from a place, where I have a great deal of pleaſure; but ſince I am of neceſſity to be gone away within eight dayes to the Court, I could not make a better end of this adventure. For <hi>Marsé</hi> forbidding me his houſe, I ſhall have a fair occaſion to write them a letter of adieu and deſpair: withall, continued he, I perceive that I begin to accuſtome my ſelf to the favours which I receive from theſe Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo that now the happineſs which love gives me, being turned into an habit, it is no longer hapineſs to me. The Marquis his Siſter was ſo aſtoniſhed to hear him talk thus, as ſhe could not forbear laughing at it: They paſt the evening in this ſort, and not to loſe time, the Marquis his Siſter advertiſed her Lover, that the next morning he ſhould repair to her Brother to acquaint him clearly with the intentions he had for her. The note which ſhe ſent failed not to work the effect ſhe expected from it; her Lover comes juſt as the Marquis is riſing, ſpeaks to him of his paſſion for his Siſter, ſhews that he covets his alliance, and in the end expreſſes his deſires ſo clearly, that the Marquis without further delay leads him to his Mothers chamber, who favoured her Daughters wiſhes, propounds the matter unto her, gets her to agree unto it; and whereas this Lover was abſolute Maſter of his Eſtate, and of his own will, they reſolved to accompliſh this Mariage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60144:71"/> within four dayes, to the end that the Marquis, who was to return to the Court, might be at his ſiſters wedding. Things being in theſe termes, <hi>Marsé</hi> arrives, who was come on purpoſe to his Miſtreſſes Mother, to diſcover his deſign unto her. As ſoon as the Marquis ſaw him enter, he deſcends, he goes and imbraces him, invites him to his ſiſters wedding, before he acquaints him to whom ſhe is to be maryed; ſeemes to believe that he is not intereſſed therein; talks to him of dancing and joy; hoping thereby, that <hi>Marsé,</hi> ſeeing the matter reſolved, would not explain himſelf further, and peradventure would alter his mind. As indeed, <hi>Marsé</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, and knowing that his rivall was returned, makes no doubt but the Marquis ſpake the truth, onely he doubted, in regard of the manner of the Marquis his ſpeech to him, whether he had obſerved that he affected his ſiſter. He was mad that he had not declared himſelf ſooner, and that he was arrived ſo late; and in this unquietneſs, he knew not whether he ſhould goe in or no, to be the ſpectator of his Rivals tryumph; whether he ſhould quarrell with the Marquis, though he knew not as yet that he was faulty; whether he ſhould depart away without ſaying any thing unto him; or whether he ſhould trouble this wedding with ſome ſtrange vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; in fine he was ſo confounded, as not knowing what to doe in ſo unpleaſing a conjuncture, he ſuffered himſelf to be conducted along by the Marquis, whoſe adreſs in this occaſion was ſuch, as without ſeeming to perceive any change in his countenance, he ſtill continued talking to him of diverſion and joy: and that too with imbracing and putting him gently on towards his Mothers chamber; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as ſoon as ever they were entred, the Marquis preſented his brother-in-law to <hi>Marsé,</hi> who ſaluted him very coldly; in the mean time he had leaſure to tell his Mother and his ſiſter in two words, that to keep <hi>Marsé</hi> from ſhewing his hatred and reſentment, he was not to be left alone with any body. After that civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were rendred on either part, the Marquis thought it was fittting that he ſhould entertain the company; he began then to quarrell with his ſiſter, for that ſhe was the cauſe of his rejoycing at a thing which was repugnant to his mind; but withall he was well aſſured, that this thing ſhould never give him joy again, either for her, or any other, and that this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was no doubt the greateſt mark he could render her of his love. <hi>Marsé</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, demanded of him, whether he meant mariage by that which he ſpake? and the Marquis without further delay, anſwered him laughing, that it was of that deſtroyer of love; of that Tyrant of libertie; of that enemy of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which moſt commonly disjoynes all that Love hath united; which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all the defects of the mind and humor, to perſons that believed they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together perfect; and that which was worſe than all the reſt for him, which ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes love, inconſtancie, and gallantry from amongſt men, to introduce into the ſtead of it, jealouſie of honor, a falſe conſtancie, and domeſtick cares. So that, as you ſpeak (replyed <hi>Marsé</hi> interrupting him) you believe it may be that you ſhould much oblige one of your friends, if you ſhould mary his Miſtreſs to another. If he ſhould tell me, anſwered the Marquis, that he would mary her, I ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his intent, for I am ſo much an enemie to conſtraint, as I never oppoſe any thing; but otherwiſe if a worthy man of my friends ſhould appear to me extremely amorous, I doe not think I ſhould doe him any great wrong, if I ſhould deprive him of the meanes of marying his Miſtreſs, in caſe his paſſion ſhould diſorder him ſo far, as to give him a deſire to doe ſo: And in the humor that I am, the greateſt proof of affection that I can render unto a maid, when I become inamoured of her, is, not to marry her: yea, and I have met with ſome, unto whom, the more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to receive my affection, and to teſtifie unto them the reſpect which I bare them, I have declared at the firſt ſight, that in becoming their Servant, I had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to become their Maſter; and in aſſuring them that I was their ſlave, I aſſured them that I would never be their Tyrant. It may be, replyed <hi>Marsé,</hi> you have not alwaies ſpoken ſo openly; that I have not, anſwered the Marquis, when I believed, that thoſe whom I loved had wit enough not to ſuſpect that I had any ſuch bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but howſoever I have never done or ſaid any thing which could make them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60144:71"/> believe, that I had any other aym, than to love them, to be kindly received of them, to be heard with pleaſure, and to obtain of them all thoſe petty favours, which are no part of the Husbands demean, and which ought alwaies to remain in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Ladies, therewith to gratifie their Lovers. For ſince there are not men found, which amuſe themſelves in wearing bracelets of their wives hair; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand favours of them; which are raviſhed with kiſſing onely the tip of their gloves; with ſaying gallantries to them, praiſing their beauties, giving them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renades; making verſes to their glory; and telling them that they burn and dye for love of them. Is it not ſtrange they ſhould be deprived of all theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? and is it not unjuſt, that men which doe not love them ſhould poſſeſs them abſolutely? and that they which adore them ſhould not at leaſtwiſe have all thoſe petty things, which are not directly oppoſite to vertue? Your maximes are ſo bad, ſaid the Marquis his Siſter, ſpeaking to her Brother, that if you had not alwayes been at Court, and that we had alwayes been brought up together, I ſhould have ſome cauſe to fear, that one might imagine you had perſwaded me to your opinion. I dare not ſay, replyed her Lover, that theſe maximes, which you condemn, have nothing in them that claſhes with reaſon; nor alſo maintain that they have nothing in them but that which is bad; for I have too much love for the Siſter, and too much reſpect for the Brother; but howſoever I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that you will not follow them. It is true, ſaid <hi>Marsé,</hi> tartly enough, that inconſtancie is not that wherewith he is to be reproched; and I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the contrary, Vertue oppoſed will not prove to be the onely crime that may be imputed to him. The Marquis perceiving that the other was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to anſwer, and peradventure with bitterneſs, continued to ſpeak of the injuſtice of men in the diſcerning of things. For, ſaid he, if the diverſity of good books renders a man knowing; if diverſity of voyages ſerves him for an agreeable ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which illuminates his mind, and informs his judgment; if the diverſity of fair arts is a knowledge that pleaſes; if the diverſity of tongues paſſes for a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable curioſity, why ſhould one think that the diverſity of loves can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good? And why will one have the grace of novelty, which is the charm of nature, to be a defect in love? For my part, ſaid <hi>Marsé,</hi> I will no longer oppoſe this doctrine, ſince an univerſall change cannot be but advantagious for me, glorious for ſome, and equitable for others. The hidden ſence of this ſpeech was eaſily underſtood by all the company; but the Marquis, who in this occaſion did not deſire to dive into things, alter'd the diſcourſe, and ſaid unto <hi>Marsé,</hi> that his Siſters muſt needs honour this Wedding with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that he muſt rejoyce with them, for that they are not ſo neer to ſlavery. The honour that you will doe them, anſwered <hi>Marsé,</hi> will ſurpriſe them, not becauſe your civilities hath not given them occaſion to attend more from you, but whereas this newes is unexpected, it is fit that I ſhould goe and advertiſe them of it, to the end they may prepare themſelves to receive the grace that you will doe them. The Marquis preſſed him extremely to paſs away the reſt of the day with them, but he would by no means ſtay; He invites him alſo to his Siſters Wedding, talks to him of Bals, Lutes, Muſick, and of all the entertainments u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall in ſuch like Feaſts: whereunto the other anſwered ſtill with ſpeeches of a double ſence. The two Rivals quipt one another civilly, which doubtleſs might have produced ſome unlucky adventure, had not the merry humour of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſweetned the converſation. <hi>Marsé</hi> took his leave of the company, with a forced countenance, which made them conceive that he had ſtrange unquietneſs in his mind. He went home then with ſo much grief, as he could not longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, and to miniſh it in ſome ſort he deſired to make his Siſters partakers of it. He ſends for them, acquaints them with the mariage of his Miſtreſs, tels them that the Marquis is unfaithfull, inconſtant, a cheater, a courtier; that cares for nothing but to pleaſe himſelf; that hath made a mockery of them; and then recounts all their converſation unto them. Theſe four Siſters were not more amazed at this Wedding whereunto they were invited, and the lightneſs of the Marquis his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60144:72"/> than to know by their Brothers diſcourſe that they were Rivals, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beguiled of the hopes which they had conceived. At firſt they beheld one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if they would ſilently reproch each other for concealing themſelves in their deſignes: But the third of theſe maids, whoſe mind was not ſo ſenſible of grief, and that could not be long without giving ſome marks of her humour, after ſhe had pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little, began to ſpeak, and ſaid with a tone of the voice of admiration, I muſt confeſs the Marquis is wonderfull dextrous, that could deceive four intereſſed maides; and though I did infinitely eſteem him, continued ſhe, I did not think he had had ſo much wit, nor that he was ſo unworthy of my friendſhip. The mindes of the three others were not ſo moderate; and though the eldeſt was of a very ſweet diſpoſition, yet could ſhe not chuſe but ſhew her reſentment. The ſecond, alwaies haughty, manifeſted hers, by ſeeming to ſhare very much in that of her brother; but as for the youngeſt, ſhe was vext to the heart, for having ſo ill aſſured her firſt conqueſt; and albeit ſhe had a great deal of wit, yet ſhe could not forbear ſhewing her choler. Howſoever the third continued ſtill ſaying, that this adventure was a new charm, which ſhe diſcovered in the Marquis, and that ingaged her to eſteem of him the more. In the mean time the wedding day arrives; <hi>Marsé</hi> feignes himſelf ſick becauſe he would not be at it; the ſiſters excuſe themſelves upon their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſickneſs: Howbeit the third makes a ſecret match with one of her kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that dwells not far of, to goe and ſee this feaſt in diſguiſe; they mask them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then very bravely, and appear in that aſſembly accompanied with certain men diſguiſed too as they were. As ſoon as they were entred into the rooom, the Marquis knew her that touched his heart ſtill; he approaches to her, makes her an hundred complements, and continues telling her, that he loves her paſſionately. But ſhe without reproaching him, anſwers, that ſhe does not doubt of it, and that the conformity which is between them ought to work ſo fair an effect. That never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it was fit they ſhould a little better examine their thoughts, it ſeeming juſt unto her, that two perſons, which made profeſſion of beguiling all the world in gallantery, ſhould not be beguiled between themſelves. This ſaid, this gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man made the Marquis ſit down by her, whilſt the reſt of the company were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and with a moſt pleaſing relation acquainted him with all that had paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her brother, her ſiſters, and her ſelf. Hereupon they promiſed much good will one to another, eſteeming too much of themſelves for ever ſpeaking together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of love. She counſelled the Marquis not to come at their houſe, but ſince he was to be gone to the Court the day following to ſend a complement to her brother and her ſiſters, as indeeed he did. The Marquis took poſt the next morning, leaving his ſiſter very well contented, <hi>Marsé</hi> in deſpair, three of his ſiſters in cholerenough. &amp; the other ſatisfied. Ever ſince that, Madam, there hath alwaies been a ſecret hate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two houſes, until ſuch time as <hi>Marsé</hi> made the report that cauſed the cmobat, which I have recounted unto you, &amp; that conſequently hath ſo happily for us brought the Marquis into <hi>Italy.</hi> I confeſs, ſaid the Princeſs, that the hiſtory hath much delighted me; and that I am much obliged unto you for acquainting me with ſo gallant and extraordinary a man. As ſhe was ſaying ſo, the Marquis came into the chamber again; whereupon ſhe began to charge him for keeping ſo long away from a company, which found his infinitely agreable to them: But he with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective boldneſs, anſwered, that knowing very well how the Count would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſome part of his humor unto her, he feared not to acknowledge, that being in doubt he ſhould not alwaies well remember what ſhe was, and alſo what he was, he vvent avvay to expoſe himſelf to the lookes of the fair <hi>Aemilia,</hi> to the end that having his heart repleniſhed vvith love, he might have nothing but veneration for her. <hi>Iſabella</hi> could not forbear laughing though ſhe bluſh'd in looking on <hi>Juſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> vvho told the Princeſs, that this foreſight and reſpect of his, merited a great deal of acknovvledgment. And I too am reſolved not to be ingratefull; but I fear vvhen as you knovv me, ſaid ſhe to the Marquis, that you vvill have a paſſion for me quite contrary to that vvich you ſeem to fear. For in fine, vvhether it be conſtancy or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, I never change my determination; vvhen once I have taken a reſolution,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60144:72"/> nothing can deſtroy it; ſo as I have great cauſe to doubt, that this difference of humours which is ſeen betwixt us, will ſet me at ods with you: but that which gives me a little hope yet, is, that I know you have friends that are not inconſtant. I confeſs, Madam, replyed the Marquis, that I am inconſtant, and that following the order of Nature, I ſhould hate that which is directly oppoſite to me; but for all that it is certain, that I am not incommodiouſly inconſtant; I never contradict any in their opinions, nor in their pleaſures; I give unto others the liberty which I deſire they ſhould grant me; I doe not blame conſtancie, though I like well of change; and my ſoul is ſo full of paſſion, as I cannot condemn all that which is called Love; whereſoever I find this paſſion, it pleaſeth me, and all the effects of it are agreeable unto me. I love jealouſie in this ſame, deſpair in him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation in ſome, infidelity in others; and although it ſeldome produces any thing but joy in me, yet does not the melancholy of a Lover, who is not of my humour, offend me. I am ſo powerfully perſwaded of the excellency of Love, as I hold for infallible, that the moſt unfortunate Lover in the World hath more happy dayes, than the freeſt of all men can have. For in fine, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what is paſt, or the hope of what is to come, ſtill gives him fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icities, which are not met withall in the poſſeſſion of other good things. Verily, ſaid the Princeſs, there was never any one ſo ſociably inconſtant; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we are ſo unjuſt, as to deſire that our ſenſe ſhould rule that of others, to approve of nothing but what pleaſeth us, and to condemn all that contradicts our opinions. And they which are of this humour, find in themſelves wherewith to maintain their ſeverity. They ſay, that whereas there is but one reaſon in all things, there is but one way to be followed; that all they which eſloign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that, doe goe aſtray, and that ſo they may be juſtly blamed. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, Madam, replyed the Marquis, that there is but one reaſon, but I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alſo, that it is ſo difficult to be known, as he who thinks he hath found it, is oftentimes further from it than others, which without judging ſoveraignty of any thing ſimply, follow the ſenſe wherewith Nature hath inſpired them. And indeed to ſpeak truth, if it be neceſſary for the equitable judging of a matter, that one ſhould be looſe from all, and ſo indifferent as to lean equally to each ſide, or to ſay better, not to lean to either; how is it poſſible that any man ſhould be ſo hardy as to make any judgment of the actions of others, principally of that which regards Love? But ſince I have been taken at <hi>Genoua</hi> for an Aſtrologer, permit me to play the cunning man in this encounter; I ſay then, Madam, that our reaſon is not ſo abſolutely looſed from ſenſe, but that our temperament hath a great ſhare in our opinions; and that that juſt mixture of the four humours, which renders the ſpirit ſo clear and ſolid, and our health ſo ſound, is ſeldom found in any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There is alwayes one of them that predominates over the reſt, and by it we act according to the pleaſure thereof; we are grave, merry, cholerick, or patient; inſenſible, or paſsionate. And certainly it is not ſo much the rigour of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick mans Miſtreſs, that makes him cry out, ſigh every minute, ſhed tears, paſs away nights without ſleep, rave from the purpoſe, talk alwayes of deſpair, and appear with a langor, that ſeems to be an effect of an extreme affliction; as the power of this predominant humour, which forces him to receive all things after this ſort. And to prove that which I ſay, we are but to conſider, that if the ſame rigour were addreſt to a man of my humour, he would receive it in another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; the jollity and joy which proceeds from the temperament, is not eaſily troubled by things without; and certainly, that which makes the melancholick man complain in Love, would give me occaſion to laugh; that which makes him to ſigh, would induce me to make verſes of gallantery; that which makes him weep, would quite cure me of my paſsion; and if I ſhould paſs nights without ſleep, it would be, doubtleſs, to give Serenades; I ſhould not rave in converſing, to weary others, and make them hate me; I ſhould not entertain my Miſtreſs with my deſpair; nor ſhould I fill her imagination with ſad thoughts, which putting her into a bad humour, might make her to uſe me ill afterwards. But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60144:73"/> I would talk to her ſtill of all the delights of them that love one another; and whereas Love is alwayes repreſented in the midſt of ſports, laughters, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, I would indeavour to inſpire her heart with joy, that ſo I might the more eaſily introduce love into it, to whom the painters do alwaies give a bed of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without ever laying him on thornes. In fine, Madam, far from perſwading my paſſion unto her by the langor of my face, I would ſhew her ſo much ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my eyes, as ſhe might very well perceive that her dominion would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me; and that I would not be like thoſe people newly conquered, who by their melancholy makes one beleeve that they are alwaies meditating ſome revolt. There are alſo two kindes of Lovers, who by the humours which predominate in them are made to doe ſtrange things, the anxious, and the cholerick. And though the former are not ſo far eloigned from the melancholick, but that they have ſome conformitie together; nor the cholerick from that ſparkling humor, and that fire which animates me; yet are they for all that differing in many things. The anxious is ſatisfied with nothing; the poſſeſſion of felicities, which he hath deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, moleſt him; he wiſhes for quite contrary things; he loves and hates all at a time; he hath a ſecret enemy within himſelf, that mingles bitterneſs with all his pleaſures; he beleeves when his Miſtreſs ſhewes him favours, that ſhe is too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of them, or that ſhe deceives him; in concluſion he is eaſily diſpleaſed; nothing can content him; and when the perſon whom he loves gives him the leaſt cauſe of jealouſie, it is enough for him to meditate on a murther. A man like me, in ſuch a like occaſion, would mock at his Miſtreſs, and his Rivall; a melancholick man in <hi>France</hi> would fight very couragiouſly, but as for an anxious man, Steel, Iron, and poyſon, would be the leaſt armes that he would make uſe of. As for the cholerick, he would receive the rigors of his Miſtreſs with tranſports of fury, ſo far forth as to offer affronts to her, to threaten her with all things; but as the cloudes, which form the tempeſts, are diſſolved when thunder breakes forth, ſo this man of choler hath no ſooner exhaled his fire by his cries, but he goes out of himſelf, and one onely look of the perſon beloved finding yet ſome impreſſion of heat in his heart, doth therein eaſily kindle that again of love; Finally he is eaſily angred, and is as ſoon appeaſed. There are yet of another temperament, who are ſo patient, as they are almoſt inſenſible; and cold predominates ſo much in them, as if it arrives that love warmes them a little, they are capable of enduring any thing: For they are ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully ſurmounted by lazineſs, that for fear of ſtiring they dare not change their Miſtreſs, but ſuffer all things without complayning. You ſee then, Madam, that the diverſity of the humours of the body contributes much to our apprehenſions; and that one and the ſame thing is ſeen after a quite different manner. And if we will give credit to the Aſtrologers in this behalf, they will tell you alſo, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> by his influence makes all the melancholicks act, as I have declared; that they, over whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> predominates, are of my humor; that <hi>Mars</hi> inflames the ſoules of thoſe, whom he governes, with the fire of choler; and that the Moon inſpires thoſe, whom ſhe commands, with a coldneſs, which makes them almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. You will tell me it may be, Madam, that theſe Starres are ſo far diſtant from us, as it is hard to comprehend how they exerciſe an abſolute power upon men; but if you conſider that which they doe in the univerſall world, you will the more eaſily beleeve that which they doe particularly in man: for in fine the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of ſeaſons is derived from them; and this ſucceſſive change of heat and cold, of flowers and fruites, which are ſeen every year, is found alſo in our ſelves. We have our ſeaſons as well as the year, and even as age changes our temperament, in changing our humours, we likewiſe change opinions. The ſecond age of life, which is the firſt for love, ſeldom fayles in producing of violent paſſions, which are often followed by imprudence and indiſcretion. As for the third, the paſſions therein are not ſo lively, but withall they are better governed: One conceales the pictures which he hath of his Miſtreſs; One no longer ſhewes the bracelets of hair which ſhe gives; One hath as much care of her conſervation as of his pleaſure; and it is in this age alone, where gallantry, a little reaſon, and a great deal of love,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60144:73"/> may ſometimes be encountred all together. But for that which followes, and is called the age of Wiſedom, Love doth in it appear ſo ſtrange, ſo dreadfull, and ſo ridiculous, as I cannot find any thing more horrible than an amorous old man. For of all the apprehenſions which this paſſion inſpires him with, he hath none left him but jealouſie: Liberality, Addreſs, Gracefulneſs, Vivacity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that fire which ſparkles in the eyes of a Lover, Reſpect, Care, Cajolleries, Verſes, Muſick, Dancing, and an hundred other things, which are ſo dependent on Love, that if it be diſpoiled of theſe ornaments, it almoſt ceaſes to be Love; all theſe things (I ſay) are no longer found ſave in his memory, and that too in a manner, which time and uſe hath rendred ridiculous. But inſtead of all that, he is covetous, uncomely, of a languiſhing ſpirit, diſ-reſpectfull, careleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of delivering a civility with any good grace, or of making Verſes that have any life in them; for the Muſes doe not uſe to favour old Lovers: And for the language of the Eyes, how ſhould they make uſe of them to expreſs their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when as ordinarily they are become ſo weak, or ſunk ſo far into their heads with age, as they are hardly to be ſeen, neither can they diſtinctly ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Finally, that Love which is painted ſo plump to us, ſo fair, ſo jolly, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, ſo merry, ſo young, ſo vigorous, a torch in one hand, a bow and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on his ſhoulder, and a ſcarf over his eyes, ſhould for them be painted, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, lean, hideous, hoary, ſad, and languiſhing, having neither bow, nor quiver, nor making other uſe of an extinguiſht torch but to lean on it, nor of his ſcarf but to wipe his eyes. So that, Madam, this diverſity, which is ſeen to arrive to one and the ſame perſon, according to the change of his humours, of his temperament, and of his ages, doth demonſtrate, that albeit there is but one reaſon to be followed, yet we doe oftentimes form many according to our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Wherefore I doe not think I am upon a bad ground, in not amuſing my ſelf about ſo vain a ſearch, as that of the true reaſon of all things, ſeeing it is ſo difficult to find; nor in following, as I doe, that which pleaſeth me, and all that which ſeems amiable to me; neither in leaving that liberty to others, which I give unto my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>After the Marquis had given over ſpeaking, and left the company very much ſatisfied with his wit, <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who would not abandon reaſons party, and who deſired the Princeſs ſhould think it was not out of caprichiouſneſs and fancy that he had veneration for her, anſwered the Marquis in this ſort. You combat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with ſo much force and addreſs, as it cannot be eaſily beleeved that you doe not know her; and the ſame wit which you have made uſe of to overthrow her dominion, manifeſts ſufficiently unto us that you are one of her ſubjects; and if at any time you quit her, it is only in this paſsion, from whence ſome, who are not acquainted with the nobleneſs of Love, would baniſh her. But for all that it is certain, that ſhe finds a place every where; that ſhe can be the Miſtreſs of all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n; that ſhe can ſubdue all the paſsions, and all the griefs of the mind; make thoſe of the body to be ſupported without impatience; withſtand our temperament, and the influences of the Stars; and by her infinite force makes us vanquiſh our ſelves, by obliging us oftentimes to deſtroy our own pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>To know this truth, we are but to conſider, that the humours which predominate in us, the conſtellation of the Stars, and that change which time works in our temperament, do not change any thing but our inclinations, which certainly are cauſed by all theſe things: Howbeit that is not powerfull enough to delude reaſon, who no way depending either on the melancholy humour, or on the Stars, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo judge ſoveraignly of all the apprehenſions wherewith ſhe inſpires us. She hath a ſeat more tranſcendent than our inclinations, which many times are found to be very low, and corrected by reaſon. All Antiquity would furniſh us with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it, and the wiſeſt have left us marks of owing all their vertue to their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which having made them prefer the ſtudy of Philoſophy before their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hath kept them from being the moſt infamous amongſt men. And truly, it were to deprive us of all the advantages which we have over beaſts, if our onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60144:74"/> ſhould have the conduct of our lives: And to make it appear that we have a deſtiny more noble than that ſame, we are but to obſerve, that the Creatures, which move not but by inſtinct, have one like unto it, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all their kind. All Harts ſeek <hi>dictamum</hi> when they are hurt; all Birds of ſeaſon ſeek for the Spring-time, and fly from the Winter without fayling; which the Lyons doe not, nor ſo many Birds that doe not ſhift Country. This inſtinct then is ſeen in all the creatures without ever failing, even as the race of the Sun, the courſe of the Rivers, and all other things which doe not depend of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, doe alwayes follow the firſt order that hath been given them, and that is ſo ne-neceſſary to them, as they cannot fail. But as for man, it is not ſo with him; he is abſolute Maſter of his thoughts, and of his actions; nothing forces him, nothing violents him, and he is ſo independent from all things, as he can even attempt upon his own life, as was often ſeen at ſuch time as it was lawfull to prefer death before ſervitude. It cannot be ſaid that this action, which deſtroyes Nature, is an effect of a naturall inclination; there muſt be then a more powerfull reaſon than our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, ſeeing it is certain, that of all the interiour apprehenſions which Nature gives us, there is none ſo ſtrong, ſo predominant, nor ſo univerſall, as the deſire of life. In the mean time, ſince there have been men found able to vanquiſh it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it may be conſequently beleeved, that there are a great number of others, who can force their inclinations, and judge ſoundly of all; and who, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which pleaſeth them, conſider only that which ought to pleaſe them. For in concluſion, our inclinations doe not move in us ſo powerfully as one may imagine they doe; they having nothing common, as I have already ſaid, with this inſtinct of unreaſonable creatures, which forceth a whole kind to doe one and the ſame thing, and which is inſtead of reaſon to them; ſince we ſee, that not onely all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all Provinces, but all men in particular, are ſo different one from another, that many times there is more difference between an Italian and an Italian, than between the whole Nation, and that of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians.</hi> Our inclinations, if we will know them well, are no other than a ſecret motion, that carries us without violence to pleaſe our ſelves more with one thing than another; ſome love the Woods better than the Rivers; and others the Waters better than the Forreſts, and that may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure by temperament; they leave not both of them for all that to know, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre their inclinations, the beauty of thoſe things, and to delight in them, which doe not touch their minds the moſt ſenſibly. But to ſhew that it is ſomewhat too weak a thing to deceive reaſon, we are but to conſider, that uſe alone forces our inclinations. Liberty, which is ſo naturall to all the World, is a good that is not deſired by all the women of <hi>Italy;</hi> cuſtome onely makes them find their houſes large enough for their walks; and the place of their devotions far enough for their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. Judge then after this, whether reaſon can ſuffer her ſelf to be vanquiſhed by enemies which time doth ſurmount. As for the paſſions, I confeſs, that they are a little more difficult to be deſtroyed; but yet I maintain, that if reaſon will oppoſe them, ſhe will appeaſe them, and reſtore tranquility to the mind that is moſt troubled. If reaſon then will act, it is certain, that, maugre the force of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the influences of the Stars, and the ages of men, we ſhall ſee the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſociable; the cholerick patient; the ſlothfull more active; a young Lover with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inconſtancie, and without indiſcretion. I acknowledge nevertheleſs, that there is a kind of paſſion, or to expreſs my ſelf more clearly, a kind of Love, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot deſtroy. This impotence proceeds not, for all that, from her weakneſs, but it is becauſe ſhe never deſtroyes that which ſhe hath eſtabliſhed; and becauſe this Love, whereof I ſpeak, is rather an effect of our reaſon, than of our paſſion; and truly, when a Lover hath, in the perſon whom he loves, met with the beauty of the body, of the mind, and of the ſoul; when as Vertue is mingled with all theſe charms; when as his vowes are not rejected; when as he feares but the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Fortune, and not that of his Miſtreſs, it is impoſsible to ſay otherwiſe than that reaſon is the Mother of a paſsion, that doubtleſs cannot diſorder the mind; that hath nothing baſe, nothing abject; that produces none but fair thoughts; that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60144:74"/> propounds no recompence unto it ſelf; and that hath no other aym but to love eternally. If I were of a humour to contradict the opinions of others (anſwered the Marquis, laughing, and looking on <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and then on <hi>Iſabella</hi>) I could ſhew you in few words, that at the very ſame inſtant when as you maintain, that one cannot be pre-occupated by his inclinations, you do not conſult ſo much with your reaſon, as with your ſenſe: But let it ſuffice for the finiſhing of our diſpute, that I will make you ſee by my experience, that my inclinations ſhall be alwayes ſtronger than my reaſon; and not to ſtay longer in giving you an example of it, know, that though I am by the moſt perfect Princeſs in the World, and in the converſation of the worthieſt perſons of <hi>Italy,</hi> yet can I not chuſe but be in ſome unquietneſs for that I doe not ſee the beautifull <hi>Aemilia.</hi> The whole company could not forbear laughing at the freedome of the Marquis; and the Princeſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether he had yet taught her Kinſwoman the French liberty, by having perſwaded her to receive his viſits without her permiſsion. Madam, ſaid he unto her, if any one be faulty in this occaſion, it can be none but I; who going out of your chamber for the reaſon which I have declared unto you, I took the boldneſs to make uſe of your name, to be received into that of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> from whence I had not departed as yet if ſhe had not driven me away. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſeeing it grow late, wiſhed the Count to bid the Princeſs good-night, for fear of incommodating her, by making her ſtay up too long; and though ſhe made them a complemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to aſſure them that they could never be troubleſome unto her, yet they retired, and were conducted by the principall Officers of her Houſe to their Lodgings. The Marquis would not abandon the Count, nor <hi>Doria,</hi> his dear <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs could have been well contented to have been alone for the better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his thoughts, but civility and friendſhip kept him from it. When as they were abed, <hi>Doria,</hi> who could conceal nothing from his friend, acquainted him, that <hi>Horatio,</hi> of the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Cibo,</hi> and the Count's Brother-in-Law, was in love with his Siſter; and that he almoſt was ſo too with the Count's Siſter-in-Law, although he had ſeen her but twice ſince his return: Howbeit that he had uſed his beſt indeavour to oppoſe this paſſion, in regard he knew very well that this Maid had an imperious humour, which would not be eaſily vanquiſhed. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thereunto in ſuch a manner, as perſwaded <hi>Doria</hi> that he had a mind to ſleep, but indeed it was becauſe his mind was ſo taken up with his own, as he was not capable of hearkening to other mens affairs; ſo that <hi>Doria</hi> fearing to incommodate him, gave over talking, and ſlept more quietly than <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> did.</p>

And whereas the Princeſs obſerved that his reſpects were not diſpleaſing to her kinſwoman, ſhe ſaid to the Marquis, for to oblige him to talk, that whereas love ought to be without ſupercherie as well as war, he having not as yet declared himſelf to be <hi>Aemilia's,</hi> ſhe might by his obſervance and ſervices be induced to beleeve that he was capable of a ſolid affection, and ſo ingage her further than was fitting. <hi>Aemilia</hi> bluſhed at this diſcourſe, and the Marquis without giving her leave to ſpeak, aſſured the Princeſs, that he ſhould not long conceal himſelf, and that the Count could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this truth unto her. Indeed, ſaid the Count, he hath not uſed to keep himſelf from being knowen, and if he would take the paines to recount unto you the firſt adventure that befell him at <hi>Genoua,</hi> his addreſs would appear to the beautifull <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi> and the relation no doubt would give your Excellencie much content. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it will be better walking towards the evening, than in the midſt of the day, and you cannot paſs it away better. The Princeſs, who was perſwaded, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis his adventures could not chuſe but be very pleaſant, intreated him thereunto with a great deal of civilitie; he excuſes himſelf a while, but in the end ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures him to it in the name of his laſt Miſtreſs; It is ſhe indeed, anſwered he, that is moſt powerfull in my heart, and that makes me to obey. The Princeſs conducted them then into a Cabinet, that was open on four ſides, and whereof all the walles were of criſtall glaſs from the top to the bottom, that ſo the proſpect might be the more free.

                  <p>BEfore I begin the relation which I am going to make, remember, Madam, though I ſpeak your language as if I were an Italian, that I am for all that a French-mam, that is to ſay, an enemy of the coldneſs, and reſervedneſs of your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60144:75"/> Nation; That it is I who have reconciled vertue and galanterie at <hi>Genoua;</hi> who have declared my ſelf the protector of the liberty of you Ladies; and who in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion have by my care and addreſs deſerved amongſt them the glorious title of their Deliverer. I tell you all theſe things, that you may not think it ſtrange, if in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this diſcourſe you underſtand ſome adventures, where the civility of this ſide the mountaines is not regularly obſerved. I know, anſwered the Princeſs, all that you have done for the publique libertie; the Count hath already acquainted me, that the galanterie, which is ſeen now at <hi>Genoua,</hi> is an effect of yours; and that in the end you have been ſo powerfull in perſwading the vertue of women, as there is ſcarce any brother or husband that is longer jealous. I am not ſorry, replyed the Marquis, that ſo worthy a man hath drawen you my picture, for though I doubt not but that he hath ſomewhat flattered me, yet you will not chuſe but know me. In the mean time ſince I muſt ſatisfie your curioſity, it is neceſſary that I give you to underſtand, how aſſoon as I was arrived at <hi>Genoua,</hi> with a deſign to ſtay there ſo long as my humor ſhould find wherewithall to entertain it ſelf, I obſerved, that near to the lodging where I lay, there was a maid, who ſeemed beautifull enough unto me, as indeed it muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>Livia</hi> hath ſomething, that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bewitching, in the air of her face, eſpecially for a man that is not melancholick; and that ſhe hath a kind of I know not what caſt with her eyes, which perſwaded me ſhe would not be very cruell. If I were known more particularly of you than I am, I would not tell you, Madam, that I loved <hi>Livia,</hi> ſince it would be enough to make you comprehend it, that I ſay to you ſhe ſeemed fair unto me. In fine, ſhe had no ſooner made an impreſſion in my heart, but I ſought the meanes to touch hers. And although it be my cuſtom to explain my ſelf clearly in matter of love, and never to leave her, whom I ſerve, to devine of my paſſion, yet in regard I durſt not yet publiſh my precepts openly, it is true that I continued a whole week together in uſing all the fantaſticall tricks of a Lover of this Country. I paſſed twenty times a day before her dore; I followed her in the ſtreets; I accompanied her in her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I ſaluted her with reſpect; I beheld her a far off with languiſhing eyes; I went every evening to make a noyſe under her windowes with a Gittern; and according to the faſhion I imployed the very addreſs of my horſe to let her ſee mine, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him curvet an hundred times before her lodging; In fine, I omitted none of thoſe fooleries, which are introduced amongſt you. But whereas I advanced my deſign very little by ſo long a way, and perceived apprehenſions of curioſity in <hi>Livia,</hi> but none at all of love (at leaſtwiſe as I could judge by the manner of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> beholding me) I began to accuſe her of ſtupiditie, or ingratitude, and to think of a retreat. But coming ſuddenly again out of this error, I reſolved not to quit her, untill I had ſerved her ſome time after the faſhion of <hi>France;</hi> or at leaſt uſed the meanes ſo to doe. For, ſaid I, am not I unjuſt in deſiring ſhe ſhould love me, becauſe I paſs oftentimes thorough a ſtreet where I doe lodge as well as ſhe? In deſiring that ſhe ſhould be obliged unto me, becauſe I take pleaſure in looking on her for that ſhe is fair? In deſiring too that ſhe ſhould recompence me, becauſe I hinder her from ſleeping ſome nights, with a bad harmony? And laſtly, would I have her judge of my wit and love, by the addreſs of my horſe? No, ſaid I, I muſt write to her, I muſt talk with her, I muſt make verſes for her, I muſt entertain her with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and my love, and after I have ſhewed her all the gallanterie of our Nation, if ſhe be ſtill rebellious to my deſires, let me quit her without much pain, and comfort my ſelf eaſily enough after it. And the better to bring my purpoſe to paſs, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the addreſs of a ſervant of mine that waites on me in my chamber, who certainly is incomparable for intricate buſineſſes. After I had propounded unto him that which I deſired, he aſſured me that within few dayes he would furniſh me at the leaſt with meanes to write unto <hi>Livia,</hi> as indeed he failed not to doe. For it had fallen out that <hi>Livia</hi> had a maid, which ſerved her, called <hi>Lucretia,</hi> to whom <hi>la Roche</hi> (for ſo is my Agent in love named) had taken a liking, and ſhe, through a ſympathy of humours, as I learned afterwards, had not beheld him with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie. It was then by this way that I wrote to <hi>Livia,</hi> for after that <hi>la Roche</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60144:76"/> my intentions he had redoubled his addreſſes to <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and for the advancing of my affaires, I had given him wherewithall to be liberall; ſo that he got this wench to promiſe that ſhe would ſhew my letters, and ſome verſes, wherein I had painted forth my love, to her Miſtreſs; but though I had imployed all my skill therein, yet could I not obtain any anſwer. <hi>Lucretia</hi> indeed told <hi>la Roche,</hi> that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> eſteemed very much of me, that my wit pleaſed her, that my converſation was agreeable unto her (for I had talked with her twice at the window by the meanes of <hi>Lucretia</hi>) but that after all I was not to pretend to her affection. I confeſs that for this time her reſiſtance provoked me more than her beauty. Behold me then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to know from whence the impoſſibility of my enterpriſe proceeded; I call <hi>la Roche</hi> to my ſuccor, and command him to repair to <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and to imploy all his cunning to diſcover <hi>Liviaes</hi> true thoughts. He preſſes her, he intreates her, he threatens to abandon her, and yet for all that ſhe acquaints him with no part of that he deſires to underſtand. At firſt ſhe tells him, that ſhe knowes nothing; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that ſhe is obliged to be faithfull to her Miſtreſs; then, that it is a thing paſt remedy; and laſt of all, without any thought of telling him that which he required, ſhe ſaies that <hi>Livia</hi> is ingaged in an affection to another, whom ſhe will not name. This newes put me into choler, and made me reſolve once more to tempt the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of <hi>Lucretia;</hi> to which effect I gave <hi>la Roche</hi> a diamond, therewith to oblige this wench to meet him one evening, and diſcover unto him the whole truth of <hi>Liviaes</hi> hiſtory. My liberalitie failed not to perſwade her better than his eloquence, ſhe meetes him in a place far enough out of the way to be overheard of any but my ſelf, who underſtood what ſhe ſaid without her perceiving it; and there, after ſhe had ſuffered her ſelf to be a little intreated, ſhe ſpake in this ſort unto him. I know very well that I commit a ſtrange infidelitie againſt my Miſtreſs, but ſince it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you, and that you promiſe me you will not ſpeak of it, I hope I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me. I will tell you then, continued ſhe, that about three dayes agoe, when as my Miſtreſs was making an end of dreſſing her, and that ſhe was doing ſomething about her head, where ſhe had no need of me, ſhe obſerved that I looked out at the window with a great deal of attention, and that I had alſo pulled up the grate. And whereas ſhe asked of me what it was I looked at ſo earneſtly, I anſwered her boldly, that it was at the worthieſt man of all her lovers; meaning your Maſter, who then paſſed along thorough the ſtreet. I fear me, replyed ſhe ſighing, that you and I are not of the ſame opinion; howbeit, <hi>Lucretia,</hi> who is he that you do treat ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to the prejudice of others? It is, ſaid I being become more hardy, the French Marquis, who verily hath an ayr, and a countenance, which none of the reſt have. And for my part, I confeſs unto you, that I ſhould be more ſenſible for a man of his Nation, than of ours. I cannot tell, <hi>Lucretia,</hi> anſwered ſhe, whether I ſhould have been as ſenſibly touched as thee, if he of whom thou ſpeakeſt had found my heart without ingagement, but this I can tell, my dear girl, that it is not in an eſtate to receive any new impreſsion, for the truth is, I am in love. Are you in love, ſaid I mightily ſurprized? I, ſaid ſhe, I am in love, and that ſo exceedingly, as I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to tell him ſo much this day, who is the cauſe of my paſsion; and who after my ill intreating of him for two yeares together, is reſolved to return unto <hi>Naples,</hi> of whence he is, and never to come to <hi>Genoua</hi> again. But I doe not purpoſe to be ſo vertuous, as to be thereby infortunate all the reſt of my life, wherefore, my dear <hi>Lucretia,</hi> thou muſt this night, when as he is to come and take his leave of me, bring him into the garden at ſuch time as my father is aſleep, where I will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive him; for I cannot endure he ſhould goe from me. He is of a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equall to mine, ſo that the greateſt harm can arrive to me by it, is to mary him whether my father will or no, who peradventure will make ſome difficulty of it, becauſe he is not ſo rich as I; howſoever, <hi>Lucretia,</hi> doe as I have bid thee, and be aſſured that I will make thee happy, if thou prove faithfull to me. As I was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to anſwer, her father came into the chambsr. In the mean time night arrived, and whereas I could doe no other but obey her, I brought in <hi>Hortenſio</hi> the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,</hi> who was received by <hi>Livia</hi> with a great deal of joy; and for a concluſion of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60144:76"/> this interview, it fell out, that after he was come to complain of her rigour, and to take his laſt farewell of her, he returned more beloved than he loved. But that the World might not think it ſtrange that he went not away after he had taken his leave of his friends, they concluded that he ſhould make a ſhew of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, but that indeed he ſhould remain concealed in <hi>Leanders</hi> houſe, where at this preſent he is, and that in the mean time he ſhould come every night into the garden to her by my meanes; and if it ſhould happen at any time that ſhe ſhould not meet him there, then he ſhould be advertiſed thereof, by not ſeeing a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher hanging at the Window, which peradventure you marked there to day, and which makes me now to leave you in haſt, for that the hour wherein <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi> ought to come, is at hand, being ſorry that I have loſt ſo much time in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other folks affaires, and omitted our own; howſoever, be faithfull to me, and ſo be gone. I confeſs, Madam, that this Wenches relation moved me more than ever any thing of that nature had done; for ordinarily, in that which concernes Love, I meaſure the eſteem which I make of Ladies, according to that which they make of me; and if I chance to encounter one who receives not my ſervices, at leaſt with civility, I preſently judge her unworthy of my choler, and love, and within a quarter of an hour after I never think of her more. But in this encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it fell not out ſo, for ſtill I conſerved a little affection, and a great deal of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be revenged. But before I would reſolve on any thing, I was willing to be yet better informed of the matter, and to underſtand certainly whether <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi> lay concealed at <hi>Leanders.</hi> It was my good hap, that <hi>Valerio,</hi> whom que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs you know, and that hath a wit very proper to imbroyl an intricate affair, proved to be a dear confident of his. And whereas we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a great friendſhip together at my being at <hi>Rome,</hi> I went and ſought him out, and having found him, I ſoon obtained of him what I deſired. He told me, that not above an hour before he parted from <hi>Leander;</hi> how it was true that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> lay concealed in his Houſe, by reaſon of an amorous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture wherewith he was very much troubled, becauſe he was inamoured of a neipce of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nthioes,</hi> named <hi>Aurelia,</hi> with whom <hi>Hortenſio</hi> had had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular commerce for a good while together: How he was in good hope, <hi>Hortenſio</hi> going away, and having no further pretenſion there, that he might have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his love to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> but how far from that, <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> not onely remained hid in his houſe, but had alſo obliged him to carry a letter to this Gentlewoman, to crave her pardon for his parting away without bidding her farewell, excuſing himſelf upon this, that his grief for leaving her had kept him from doing ſo. He told me likewiſe, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> had received <hi>Hortenſio's</hi> letter with much teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of affection; that <hi>Leander</hi> had been greatly tempted to diſcover unto her how ſhe was betrayed, and to make his profit of his friends deceit; but that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion friendſhip had prevailed with him above love. That being returned to <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> he had very much preſt him to let him know why he was unfaithfull to <hi>Aurelia?</hi> how he had freely anſwered thereunto, that his inclination was to <hi>Livia;</hi> how for the other, he ſerved her out of acknowledgement, it being moſt certain that he was very much obliged unto her. How after all this he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether a friend of his ſhould diſoblige him in thinking of her, ſince he loved her but for conſideration? How <hi>Hortenſio</hi> was netled with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and had teſtified unto him that he would not endure it. Behold, Madam, the eſtate of things; <hi>Livia</hi> loved <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> and was beloved of him; I loved <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and was ill intreated of her; <hi>Aurelia</hi> loved <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> and was betrayed by him; <hi>Leander</hi> loved <hi>Aurelia,</hi> not daring to diſcover it unto her, and was an inſtrument of his friends treaſon; <hi>Valerio</hi> was <hi>Leanders</hi> confident, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him for my ſake; <hi>Lucretia</hi> for being faithfull to <hi>la Roche,</hi> was unfaithfull to her Miſtreſs; in fine, we all of us almoſt did that which we ought not to have done. The buſineſs ſtanding in theſe termes, I reſolved to ſpeak once more with <hi>Livia;</hi> and whereas it is moſt certain, that when one comes to know that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beloved accords to another favours which ſhe refuſeth to him, he changeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60144:77"/> into boldneſs, and no longer demands her affection as a grace, but as a debt. I went and attended <hi>Livia</hi> ſome three or four ſteps from her door, with a mind that retained little of the French civility. At her firſt appearing, followed onely by <hi>Lucretia,</hi> I advanced directly unto her, and preſenting her my hand with a contemning negligence, I ſaid unto her in ſomewhat a bitter manner: It may be, faireſt <hi>Livia,</hi> that being unable to merit any thing of you as a Lover, yet in the quality of a Gentleman-Uſher I may be permitted to help to lead you. I know not, anſwered ſhe, with a ſerious countenance, what renders you ſo bold as to interrupt me in my way; but I know very well, that if you have not a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſpleaſe me, and did know my humour, you would not be ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as to dare to ſpeak to me with ſo much liberty; for I make profeſſion of a modeſty, which cannot ſuffer ſuch things, and which you might very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the coldneſs wherewith I have alwayes treated you. I confeſs that the diſcourſe netled me; I could not endure this ſevere vertue in a perſon that had none but for me; and that reproching me with her rigour, ſeemed as though ſhe would make me ſerve for the triumph of her Lover. I retained her then by the arm, as ſhe was offering to goe away, and in a quipping and jeering manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her with a malicious ſmile, I ſaid unto her; it is true, <hi>Livia,</hi> that I have been raſh and inconſiderate in daring to lift up my eyes towards a perſon of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a vertue, as cannot ſuffer one to adore her; as cannot endure one ſhould ſpeak to her of Love; as loves even darkneſs, and hates the light, becauſe it might diſcover that which ſhe would conceal from moſt men. Indeed, anſwered ſhe, I hate the Sun, becauſe by it I ſee you. It may be, ſaid I unto her with the ſame countenance, and looking juſtly on her, that you do not hate the Moon ſo much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mid-night. Whereupon ſhe ſtrove mightily to get away, but in regard I held one corner of her vail, ſhe durſt reſiſt no further, perceiving plainly that I no longer reſpected her. Nay, ſaid I unto her, as ſhe would have gone from me, you muſt hear me whether you will or no, for ſince it is a ſute of Love, it is but juſt that you ſhould hear me, as well as you have heard my Rivall; and that to be well informed of the juſtice of our cauſe, you give him audience in the night, and me in the day; for I doe not deſire that in conſideration of me an handkercher ſhould be hung in the Window; that <hi>Lucretia</hi> ſhould deſcend into the garden; that a door which ſeems to be ſhut, ſhould be left open; nor that I ſhould be a gallant, who ſeems to be abſent, and yet failes not to be at the aſſignation which is given him. Verily <hi>Livia's</hi> aſtoniſhment made me almoſt repent for what I had ſpoken, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I could not contain my reſentment, The firſt thing that <hi>Livia</hi> ſaid after this diſcourſe, was; Ah <hi>Lucretia,</hi> you have betrayed me! But this Wench, who in this occaſion appeared to me to be the moſt dextrous and daring that ever was, anſwered her with an extreme precipitation; I Madam! would to Heaven you were not more betrayed, in acknowledging that which I never revealed. In the mean time, <hi>la Roche,</hi> who had heard all that I ſaid, was much vexed at my engaging <hi>Lucretia</hi> by my diſcourſe; ſo that approching to me, he ſaid ſoftly to me in French, O Sir, what have you done? I doe not know, ſaid I ſtepping a little back, but, if thou canſt, re-accommodate this diſorder. During this, <hi>Lucretia</hi> ſwore falſe oaths to her Miſtreſs for the clearing of her innocency; and the poor <hi>Livia</hi> was ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as ſhe could reſolve of nothing; in fine, we were all four exceedingly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I was vexed for having ſpoken ſo laviſhly; <hi>Lucretia</hi> was much troubled in juſtifying her ſelf; my Agent knew not what to doe, either for <hi>Lucretia,</hi> or for me; and <hi>Livia</hi> could think of nothing that would ſatisfie her: She vvould fain have railed on me, but ſhe ſavv that I vvas too much acquainted vvith her affairs to be incenſed more; She could have been contented never to have ſeen me again, but ſhe feared leſt parting avvay vvithout ſaying any thing unto me, I ſhould publiſh that vvhich I knevv. At laſt, ſhe vvould vvillingly have recalled me, for I vvas ſtept a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from her, and ſtood muſing with my ſelf, but her heart vvould not conſent that ſhe ſhould uſe any civility to me after that vvhich I had ſaid unto her. Behold, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the eſtate vvherein vve ſtood, vvhen as <hi>la Roche,</hi> the moſt daring fellovv that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60144:77"/> is, approched unto <hi>Livia,</hi> and ſaid unto her for the juſtification of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> with a ſeeming ſinceritie: I know very well, Lady, that I do put my ſelf in danger of being turned away by my Maſter, in diſcovering a thing unto you, which he greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to conceal, but the condition wherein you are, and the innocency of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> forces me to open it unto you. Know then, continued he, that whatſoever he hath ſaid unto you is not the effect of my bodies treaſon, but of Aſtrology, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands perfectly. It is a ſcience wherein he is become ſo expert, that if I ſhould recount unto you the mervailes, which I have heard him tell, you would be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſurpriſed with it. And whereas he is paſſionately in love with you, ſeeing you very rigorous to him, he hath ſpent every night for theſe eight dayes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the Starres, and turning over his books, to diſcover the cauſe thereof, and without doubt it was by this meanes that he is come to know that which he hath ſaid unto you: he hath ſhewed me, continued he, the garden, where you were, in a great glaſs, though I would not underſtand what you ſaid. Truely the invention of this lad amazed me; it was in vain for me to make ſignes unto him to hold his peace; the more unquietneſs that I ſhewed, the more he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſpeaking; and I may ſay that I was never in greater pain, for I heard all that he ſaid. But whereas I ſaw that he went confounding things, and that from an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger he would quickly make me paſs for a Magician, in talking of an inchanted glaſs, I reſolved to help forward this trick, that ſo I might make him hold his tongue, wherefore I called him ſomewhat rudely, and having commanded him to withdraw, I came to <hi>Livia</hi> with civilitie enough, juſt as <hi>Lucretia</hi> was ſaying to her boldly, how ſhe had already heard it aſſured indeed, that I dealt with telling of fortunes. And having ſaluted her for the better colouring of the buſineſs, I ſeemed to be very angry with <hi>la Roches</hi> imprudence, in diſcovering to her a thing, which I would not have known, in regard of the brutiſhneſs of the people, who imagine that one cannot obſerve the Starres, without having commerce with the Devill; and know not how to put a difference between Aſtrologie and inchantments. But ſince the fault was done, I deſired her to oblige me to her diſcretion, by not publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which had been told her. I ſaid unto her alſo, that parting from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> I had paſt through <hi>Provence,</hi> where hapning to be lodged near to a great <hi>Noſtradamus,</hi> ſo admirable in this ſcience, as it was not known whether he ſhould be tearmed a Prophet, or an Aſtrologer, I had been ſo happy, as to touch his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to gain his friendſhip even to the point to teach me a part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things he knew, either for Aſtrologie, Phiſiognomy, or Chiromancie. In fine, I ſpake to her with ſo much art, as ſhe beleeved me; and beleeved too that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> was innocent, who on her ſide played her part ſo well, as ſhe made me aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. She clapt her hands together, ſhe accuſed her Miſtreſs for having accuſed her; and the poor <hi>Livia</hi> was almoſt ready to make excuſes unto her, ſo well was ſhe perſwaded. And the cauſe why a diſcourſe of this kind did not ſurpriſe her ſo much as another, and was more credible with her, was, for that ſhe had all her lifetime heard her Father talk of this ſcience, who juſt as we were there came out of his houſe; aſſoon as I ſaw him I would have been gone, but <hi>Livia</hi> ſtayed me, and ſaid to me with a great deal of ſpirit, I know too well what reſpect a man of your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth owe to one of my ſex, to be affrayed you ſhould be indiſcreet; and ſince it is true, that y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>u doe know the force of deſtiny, and the influences of the Starres, you may well know by them, that I cannot eſchue what they have reſolved. In the mean time the old man, who was not accuſtomed to ſee his daughter in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, drew near, and after he had but coldly ſaluted me, demanded of her what ſhe did there? but I was ſtrangely amazed, when as ſhe anſwered him, that meeting not long before with a friend of hers, whom ſhe loved very well, ſhe underſtood by her that I was one of the greateſt Aſtrologers in the world, and that being curious to know wether ſhe ſhould be maried or no, ſhe had deſired my acquaintance, which the ſame friend had procured her. I perceived that <hi>Livia</hi> had ſpoken in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, notwithſtanding the requeſt that I had made unto her, to the end ſhe might know whether I had ſaid the truth; ſo that I reſolved to ſtand to it. But I found my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60144:78"/> ſelf much perplexed, when as this old man ſaid to her in a grave tone, that many men had imployed all their lives in this ſtudy, and had taken upon them the name of Aſtrologers, but that few had come to the point of deſerving it. Then turning him to me with a more open countenance, he ſaid unto me, that if I were ſuch a one as his daughter told him, he would ſerve me with all his heart; that he was very much affected to men of merit, and to the lovers of ſciences, whereof the vulgar were ignorant; and that in concluſion, if he ſhould tell me truth, he muſt confeſs that in times paſt he had given himſelf to judiciary Aſtrology; but that the trouble of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick affaires had kept him from excelling therein; howbeit that he ſtill knew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be able to diſcourſe a little with me of it, if I would come and viſſit him at his houſe, whereof he ſhewed me the door. I leave you to judge, Madam in vvhat a caſe a man might be, that knevv not ſo much as the names of the Signes and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; I made uſe of confidence then in the incounter, and told him that I vvould not fail to come and take out a leſſon vvith him, and aſſured him that he ſhould have a ſcholler of me, vvhich vvould receive his inſtructions vvith a great deal of joy. <hi>Leonardo</hi> (ſo is this man called) took this true ſpeech for a modeſt civility; and ſaid unto me again, that he ſhould be glad to hear me tell him ſomething of his fortune; and to perſvvade me that he vvas knovving he ſaid to me alſo, that he had a great deſire I ſhould goe and diſpute vvith him a little in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, that he might knovv vvhether the Planets (except <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi>) vvhoſe influences be the happieſt, are not they vvhoſe pararells are the greateſt. Novv for me, that ſhould have been healed of a quartan ague vvith a vvord leſs terrible than this, I ſavv it vvas time to retire, vvhich I did after I had told him again that I vvould very ſhortly come home to him and ſhevv him my ignorance. He vvould have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to enter preſently vvith him, but I excuſed my ſelf dextrouſly from it, and ſo departed, after I had ſaluted <hi>Livia</hi> civilly enough, and beheld <hi>Aucretia</hi> vvith a ſign, that teſtified unto her hovv I vvas ſorry I had given her ſo much unquietneſs in ſo little a time. I vvas not four ſtepps from them but regarding this adventure with a more quiet eye, I found it ſo pleaſant, that I had no other paſſion but to make it laſt as long as I could: And this manner of revenging my ſelf appeared ſo ſweet unto me, as I thanked <hi>la Roche</hi> above an hundred times for finding out this invention, ſeeing it had ſucceeded ſo well, Now entring into my lodging I met with <hi>Valerio,</hi> unto whom I gave an account of all that hapned unto me, wherewith he was ſo ſurpriſed and raviſhed, as he could not believe that which I told him, ſo much did he fear that it was not true. He would not rely upon my word, but would have the teſtimony of my Agent too; and though I was offended at it, yet was he above an hower doubting whether it were a jeſt, or a truth, which I told him. But in the end, perceiving I ſpoke ſeriouſly he believed me, and this trick ſo pleaſed his humor, and touched his inclination ſo mightily, that he loved me a great deal the more for it. It was adviſed than, ſince the father had had a part in the deceite, and that the buſineſs might be divulged, that it was better to have me paſs for an Aſtrologer than for an impoſtor, and to ſow the bruite of it about the Town, before <hi>Leonardo</hi> ſhould have leiſure to diſcover that he had been gulled: But I oppoſed this adviſe a good while, for, ſaid I, no ſooner ſhall I be conſidered as a Contemplator of the Starres, but they will come and ask me an hundred queſtions, whereunto I ſhould not know what to anſwer, ſo that I cannot tell how to turn my ſelf in this affair. What you ſhall anſwer, ſaid my Agent? You ſhall anſwer, continued he, juſt as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe; ſometimes I, ſometimes no, be it favourably or fatally, and for the reſt, much good may it do them; for in concluſion, an Aſtrologer never warrants any thing. <hi>Valerio</hi> fell a laughing at this diſcourſe, and told me likewiſe for the uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this opinion, that this ſcience being ſo difficult as it was, it might be that chance would make me prophecy ſooner, than all Aſtrologicall rules and ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That I vvas but to ſpeak alvvaies obſcurely; never to affirm any thing vvith cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; to conſider a little the quality and age of perſons; to ſpeak ſeldom of the paſt, or the preſent, without good information thereof; and of the future to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe alvvaies by Emblemes, and Enigmaes, and commonly to foretell more good
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60144:78"/> fortune than bad. In the mean time <hi>la Roche</hi> went and got me a book of Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the forming of my ſtile, an Almanack to teach me the names of the Signs and Planets, and another Book which treated confuſedly of the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Horoſcopes, of the Sphere, and of Chiromancie. Behold me then well entred into the Zodiack, whilſt <hi>Valerio</hi> and my Agent went as ſoon as we had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to begin the publiſhing of the Wonders of my Science. I ſet my ſelf then with a great application of my mind to the comprehending of ſome part of this myſterious Doctrine; but at length I judged that it would be enough in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, without imploying either the mind or the judgment, to make it a labour of the memory; ſo that before <hi>Valerio</hi> was returned, I could already tell that the Stars have three ſorts of riſing and ſetting, called <hi>Heliack, Coſmick, Acronick;</hi> I could tell alſo that there are ten circles in the Sphere, ſix great, and four little; that the great are the Equinoctiall, the Zodiack, the Meridian, the Horizon, and the two Colures; and the little ones, which cut it unequally, are the two Tropicks of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and the two Polarie Circles, the Artick and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick. I knew the Septentrionall and Boreall Bear, the Zenith, the Hemiſphere, the Colure of the Equinoctials; the five Zones, the Torrid, the Cold, and the Temperate; I could ſay too, that <hi>Saturn</hi> regarding <hi>Hecate</hi> with a trine Aſpect, and the tail of the Dragon folding it ſelf about the Scorpion, prognoſticate no good; That <hi>Venus</hi> receiving the oppoſite radiations of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of the Moon, doe preſage nothing but diſorders: In fine, I knew the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, the Ecliptick, the Climats, the point Verticall, the Crab, the Bull, the Ram, the Lion, and all thoſe illuſtrious animals, which command over men ſo far off. So that <hi>Valerio</hi> comming in, I began to make a flouriſh, and to tell him, that <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> being diametrically oppoſite to <hi>Diana,</hi> but without giving me leave to make an end, he told me that he had ſuch pleaſant things to acquaint me with, as he muſt needs relate them to me preſently for fear of forgetting them. And when as I had given him all the attention he could deſire, it was a good while before he could ſpeak, he was ſo taken up with laughter. And truly I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved plainly in this occaſion, that this is many times a contagious diſeaſe; for though I knew not what had arrived unto him, yet could I not forbear laughing almoſt as much as he, ſo ready I am to comply with my friends. But at laſt, after he had above twenty times interrupted his relation, he recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto me, that the firſt man which he had taken in his trap, was <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> whom he had encountred a little from thence when he went forth; that as ſoon as he had perceived him, he had made as though he had not ſeen him, and that paſſing by him with his eyes on the ground, he ſaid ſomewhat loud, I did never think that a man could have wrought ſuch Prodigies; That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Leander</hi> had ſtayed him, and asked him what thoſe marvails were which he had ſeen? That he ſeeming to be much ſurpriſed with his over-hearing him, had anſwered, I can ſcarce tell, ſo much am I ſtill tranſported with aſtoniſhment and admiration at that which I have ſeen; That afterwards <hi>Leander</hi> had preſt him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to tell him what it was; and whereas he would have been ſorry not to have ſatisfied his curioſity, he had conſented thereunto, but that firſt he had uſed all the ceremonies of a man that would deliver a great ſecret; that he had look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all about to ſee whether they might be over-heard; that he had made him ſwear that he ſhould not ſpeak of it again to any body, unleſs it were to his moſt ſpeciall friends; That in fine he had omitted nothing of whatſoever might make him hearken with attention, and render him credulous. And that after all theſe preparations, he had ſaid to <hi>Leander,</hi> would you beleeve that this French Marquis, who is ſo much my friend, and with whom I am ſo often, could in my preſence doe the moſt miraculous things that ever you heard ſpeak of, or can poſſibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine? Now I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Leander</hi> unto him, hold me no longer in ſuſpence; know then, anſwered <hi>Valerio,</hi> ſince you will needs know it, that yonder man, whom you ſee ſo joviall and ſo gallant, is the greateſt Aſtrologer that ever was, or ever will be; if ſo be there be no inchantment in that which I have ſeen, as I much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60144:79"/> He declared himſelf to me this morning (continued he) and told me ſuch particulars of my life, as none but my ſelf could know; and this he found out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in an inſtant, by drawing ſome figures upon a paper, and looking on my hand, for he is alſo both a Palmiſter and a Phiſiognomiſt. Is it not the French Marquis (ſaid <hi>Leander,</hi> interrupting him) otherwiſe the Marquis of <hi>Touraine,</hi> that lodges here hard by? The very ſame, anſwered <hi>Valerio;</hi> I had never the honour, ſaid <hi>Leander,</hi> to talk with him above once or twice, but I perceived then by his countenance and his diſcourſe that he was, I will not ſay, an Aſtrologer, but at leaſtwiſe a man that was addicted to extraordinary ſciences; howbeit I did not beleeve that it was at that point you ſpeak of. You will then be far more ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed yet, replyed <hi>Valerio,</hi> if I carry yov along with me one day, when he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to let me ſee a woman that lives at <hi>Rome,</hi> and whom I loved at ſuch time as I was there. And this too is one of the leaſt things he can doe; for if I ſhall tell you the truth, I have ſeen and heard a picture ſpeak, and that is it which cauſes the confuſion wherein you ſee me. <hi>Leander</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed, as <hi>Valerio</hi> told me that he changed colour at it, and earneſtly intreated him to bring him acquainted with me, which he promiſed to doe, upon condition that he ſhould not publiſh what I had told him, for fear I might be ſuſpected to be a Magician; and that at length, after many other diſcourſes on this ſubject, they parted very well ſatisfied one of another. And for a concluſion, <hi>Valerio</hi> ſaid unto me, this is the firſt fool I met withall; then he recounted to me how he went unto the Academy, where he had imparted to a great many the Wonders that I did; that to publiſh them the better, he had told them unto them in their ear, and had prayed them not to ſpeak of it, or at leaſtwiſe not to name me; that going from thence he went and made a turn about the Market-place, where he had met with a man, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unto him part of the things that he had told in ſecret to the Academy, as one that was verily perſwaded of it; which had ſo aſtoniſhed him, as to keep his countenance he was fain to enter into a Tennis-court, where he had found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, whom he knevv not, that vvas talking very earneſtly to five or ſix per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, vvhich hearkened to him very attentively, and aſſuring them that I vvas the greateſt Aſtrologer of this Age; and that he had ſeen me doe an hundred things, which he recited unto them. That whereas he could not forbear laughing, he had ſet himſelf merrily to contradict him, but that this man without going about to ſeek for reaſons to convince him, had told him roundly, that he ſpake in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe he did not know me, but that he ſpake upon certainty, for that I was one of his beſt friends, it being not an hour ſince he parted from me; ſo that after he had recounted all theſe things unto me, ſaid <hi>Valerio,</hi> deſpairing of making a better encounter than that of this man, I came away to find you out, ſo ſatisfied with my lye, as if it ſhould alwayes ſucceed ſo luckily, I would make a vow never to ſpeak truth again. After we had laughed well at this adventure, and rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the fantaſticalneſs of the World, which loves to beleeve, or at leaſt to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bad newes, and prodigies, we ſaw my Agent return, whoſe voyage had had a quite other ſucceſs. He had met but with few to publiſh that which he deſired ſhould be known, ſo that being mad for having done ſo little for a man of his humor and addreſs, he had reſolved not to come back till ſome good adventure befell him. He had ſought then in vain for ſome one to deceive, when as a Maid, named <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> who ſerved <hi>Aurelia,</hi> ſaid to him in paſſing cloſe by him at ſuch time as one could ſcarce ſee, follovv me. It is ſufficient to ſay, that this Lad vvas brought up in my ſervice, to make one be aſſured that he follovved her foot by foot, for fear of loſing the ſight of her. This Wench led him into a by-lane, vvhere fevv folks came, for it was almoſt nothing but garden walls; When they were arrived there, <hi>Camilla</hi> told him, that a perſon very conſiderable, both for her merit, and her beauty, attended a ſpeciall ſervice from me; that the reputation which I had of being the civilleſt of men, made her hope that I would not refuſe her; and that if I would do her this grace, I ſhould not fail then to be at a little garden door, which ſhe ſhewed him in the ſame lane; and to oblige him to truſt in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60144:79"/> her words ſhe gave him a note which her Miſtreſs had written unto me. My Agent aſſured her, that I placed my greateſt glory in doing ſervice to Ladies; but whereas he preſt her to tell him what it was that <hi>Aurelia</hi> deſired of me (for though it was almoſt dark, yet knew he <hi>Camilla,</hi> whom he had often ſeen with her Miſtreſs) ſhe ſaid to him, that if I were ſuch a one as I was reported to be, I could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as he was, and therefore that might ſuffice for the preſent. <hi>La Roche</hi> judged rightly then, that there was ſomewhat of the Aſtrologer in this adventure, ſo that to help on the matter; you have reaſon unknown fair one, ſaid he unto her, to think that <hi>Aureliaes</hi> ſecret will be none to my Maſter, for if he pleaſes he knowes that which now we doe. Alas! ſaid the wench again, how affraid am I of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and how do I wiſh that he may never think of me. There is nothing to be feared, ſaid <hi>la Roche</hi> unto her, when as he knowes your adventures, for he is as diſcreet as he is knowing. But at laſt after a reaſonable long communication, where <hi>Camilla</hi> ſtill aſſured, that ſhe would by no meanes ſerve ſuch a Maſter, ſhe told me, that I was not to fail, if it were poſſible, in being at that garden door the ſame night when as the Moon was down; or if I could not be there accordingly, that then I would be there the next night at the ſame time; that ſhe would be ready at that place to give me entrance, and her Miſtreſs in the garden, where I ſhould ſpeak with her. I confeſs, when <hi>la Roche</hi> related this unto us that I could not chuſe but take great pleaſure in it, and much deſire to read the note that was written to me. If I had as happy a memory as a <hi>Romanzes Heros,</hi> I would recite it unto you without changing a ſillable, but ſince I have it not, it ſhall ſuffice that I do tell you in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, how <hi>Aurelia</hi> intreated me with a great deal of civilitie and affection, that I would imploy that mervelous ſcience, which I exerciſed ſo nobly, in ſetting her mind at reſt; that from me alone ſhe expected ſuccor for her unquietneſs, and that in fine, if I were a Frenchman (which according to her ſence was to ſay civill) I would not refuſe her. <hi>Valerio</hi> was ſo raviſhed with this encounter; my Agent was ſo glad of it, and at firſt daſh I found it ſo pleaſant, as we paſt away an hower very merrily. But when I perceived that <hi>Valerio</hi> would have me try this adventure, my pleaſure diminiſhed by the half: The more I oppoſed his will, the more he perſiſted in van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing mine; it was in vain for me to repreſent my ignorance unto him, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order that might arrive unto me by it, the perplexity wherein a man would find himſelf to be, when he muſt ſpeak of that he does not know; for to all theſe objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had wherewith to anſwer me. He in the firſt place laid it down to me for a ground, that to the end I might not be taken for an impoſtor by <hi>Leonardo,</hi> and to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe the cheat which he had uſed to an hundred perſons, in aſſuring them that I was a great Aſtrologer, it was neceſſary, that I ſhould uſe two or three one after another; that otherwiſe I ſhould loſe the reputation which he had gained me; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But before I tell you vvhat arrived to me in this garden, I muſt recount unto you, Madam, that vvhich vvas the cauſe of this adventure; for vve vvere made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted vvith it aftervvards; You remember, no doubt, hovv I told you, that <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

I remember all this, ſaid the Princeſs, interrupting him, and to teſtifie it unto you, I remember that <hi>Leander</hi> loved <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and durſt not tell her ſo much, becauſe <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſio</hi> had ſome commerce vvith her, although it vvas <hi>Livia</hi> that poſſeſſed his heart, and that <hi>Leander</hi> play'd but an outvvard part in being conſtrained to ſerve the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture of his friend, and to carry <hi>Hortenſioes</hi> letters to <hi>Aurelia</hi> as if he had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though indeed he lay concealed in his houſe for to goe every night unto <hi>Livia</hi> in a garden. Since it is ſo, ſaid the Marquis, I am then but to tell you, Madam, that after <hi>Leander</hi> had been powerfully perſwaded of the wonders which <hi>Valerio</hi> had told him I could doe, he changed the reſolution he had taken to ſtay till <hi>Hortenſio</hi> had broken off with <hi>Aurelia,</hi> into that of diſabuſing her by a pretty ſubtill way, if ſhe had had a true ground for it, and that I had been ſuch a one as he beleeved me to be. And behold how he reaſoned with himſelf; I am going, ſaid he, to <hi>Aurelia</hi> for a letter which ſhe is to give me to day for <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> whom ſhe beleeves to be at <hi>Naples,</hi> or on the way thither, ſhe hath already ſhewed a great deal of grief for his abſence; now if I can bring her to ſpeak of that again, I will tell her what <hi>Valerio</hi> hath told me of the French Marquis; ſo that if ſhe ſhall happen to be curious to ſee her abſent Lover by the ſcience of this man, ſhe ſhall likewiſe ſee that he is not at <hi>Naples;</hi> that he is ſtill at <hi>Genoua;</hi> that he loves another, and by theſe meanes I ſhall deſtroy her affection to him, and it may be make my profit of this diſorder. This reſolution ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he goes to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who after ſhe had given him her letter, fayled not to ſpeak of the abſence of her Friend, to ask of him whether he thought it would not be long ere he would return? Whither he had not taken this ſeparation heavily? and whither he had not already a longing to ſee him again, though it were but lately ſince he went away? Yea ſo great a one, anſwered <hi>Leander,</hi> who would by no meanes loſe ſo fair an occaſion, as I am almoſt reſolved to try the ſcience of a great and excellent man, that is not far off. <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſtraitway would needes know of him what he meant by that which he ſaid, whereupon he recounted unto her all that <hi>Valerio</hi> had told him, and a great deal more; that I made the dead to ſpeak, and thoſe that were abſent to return again, but in ſuch a manner, that one ſaw the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom one deſired to ſee, as if they had been effectually in the place where they ſeemed to be; and that this was done without inchantment, and by naturall cauſes, but hidden from moſt part of the world; that one muſt be very skilfull in the knowledge of ideas and ſimpathies for the comprehending of any part of theſe mervelous effects; but in fine, how he was certain, that what he ſaid was true. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi> hearkned to this diſcourſe with much attenſion; at firſt, ſhe ſeemed to doubt of that which <hi>Leander</hi> told her, but it was doubtleſs to make her ſelf the more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it. For after he had confirmed the matter unto her, as ſhe deſired it; and that he had told her my name, ſhe demanded dexterouſly of him where I lay, and by what way one durſt propound ſuch things unto me, ſeeing I was a man of quality, and that made no publick profeſſion thereof. He anſwered her, how it was to be done by requeſt, and that if ſhe deſired any thing of me, he had a friend that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intimate with me. She thanked him, and ſo civilly gave him to underſtand that ſhe would be vvell contented vvith his departure. He vvas no ſooner gone, but ſhe called <hi>Camilla,</hi> vvho vvas the confident of her ſecrets (for ſhe recounted all this to me aftervvards) and reported faithfully unto her all that <hi>Leander</hi> had told her. And for a concluſion, ſhe ſhevved her that ſhe vvas abſolutely reſolved to ſpeak vvith me, and to intreat me to let her ſee her dear <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> of vvhom ſhe had not taken her leave. They reaſoned a vvhile upon this ſubject, but at laſt love prevailed vvith her above good manners. <hi>Camilla</hi> told her Miſtreſs, that ſhe knevv a man by ſight vvhich ſerved me; ſo that vvithout further delay ſhe choſe rather to vvrite to me, as I have declared unto you, and to make uſe of this vvench, than to accept of the offer vvhich <hi>Leander</hi> had made her. In the mean time, the hovver of aſſignation being come, I vvent to the garden door; <hi>Valerio</hi> and my Agent ſtayed three or four paces of, till I entred, vvhich vvas not long firſt, for ſcarcely had I touched the door, vvhen as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60144:80"/> came and opened it, with a light in her hand, and told me that her Miſtreſs attended me in a Cabinet, which was at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne corner of the Garden, whether ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently led me. It is very true, that when firſt I ſaw <hi>Aurelia,</hi> ſhe ſeemed ſo fair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, though ſhe were half covered with her vail, as little lacked but that I had ſpoken to her rather of the beauty of her eyes, than of the influences of the Stars. But ſhe gave me no leaſure to deliberate on my complement; for ſhe ſpake firſt, and deſired me to pardon her the boldneſs ſhe had taken in putting me to the trouble to come to ſee her; ſhe prayed me to conſider, that ſince ſhe had failed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which ſhe owed to her ſelf, ſhe might well fail in the civility which was due to me. I anſwered to this diſcourſe with a great deal of ſubmiſſion; afterwards ſhe ſpake to me of the reputation which I had for Aſtrology, of the things that ſhe had been told of me, and how much ſhe had deſired to ſee me. I received theſe praiſes with a careleſneſs, reſpectfull enough for all that, which doubtleſs made her beleeve that I thought I well deſerved it. And ſtill to gain time I lengthened this diſcourſe as much as poſſibly I could; but ſhe, that came not thither to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, ſaid with a low voyce, as though ſhe had been afraid to be over-heard, though there was no body there but <hi>Camilla,</hi> that kept Sentinell at the Cabinet-dore; the Wonders which have been recounted to me of your Science, perſwades me, that it would be eaſie for you, if you will, to ſpare me the labour to tell you that which I deſire of you, ſince without queſtion you know it already. It is certain that this diſcourſe ſurpriſed me after a ſtrange ſort; and I beleeved, in the confuſion wherein I was, that I ſhould find nothing to anſwer her with; but at length, after a great conteſt with my ſelf, it is for the ſame reaſon, ſaid I, that your modeſty ought not to keep you from ſpeaking; for ſeeing it is a ſecret which I am not ignorant of, what you ſhall ſay of it ought not to add any thing to your confuſion. It is true, ſaid ſhe, but I ſhould be gladder to hear it from you, than to have it delivered by me; be not therefore ſo rigorous, and if it be poſſible, doe that which I deſire without my telling it you. This obſtinacy made me almoſt mad, and I vow to you, that the modeſty of the ſevereſt Miſtreſs that ever I had, troubled me not ſo much, as that of this Maid. And ſeeing this confuſion ſtill augmenting, I ſaid unto her with the tone of a more ſerious voice; Fair <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> I ſhould be willing enough not to oblige you to the doing of a thing that ſeems unprofitable to you, if I had not a ſecret reaſon which conſtraines me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and ſince I muſt let you underſtand it, know, that by the force of my art, I can tell not onely that which you deſire of me, but whatſoever hath arrived unto you, that which you think at this preſent, and that which ſhal befall you hereafter; but if by a plain and faithfull relation, you doe not ſhew the conſent you bring to that which you would have me doe for you, it will be impoſſible for me to ſerve you; and beware, ſaid I unto her, lifting up my voice, leſt that which you call mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, be not an effect of the doubt you have of my Science, in deſiring by this eſſay to aſſure your ſelf of it. There muſt be confidence in this myſtery, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I, for I doe not work onely by the ordinary wayes of Aſtrology, but I think I have gotten ſome extraordinary knowledges which go beyond them: And to teſtify it unto you, I will preſently tell you, if you deſire it, all the moſt ſecret thoughts of your heart, but after that look for nothing more from me. She ſtayed me then with a great deal of precipitation, and ſaid to me almoſt trembling, ſeeing it is a tribute which I muſt render unto you, I am reſolved for it; then ſhe recounted unto me that which I knew already without inchantment, I mean, that ſhe loved <hi>Hertenſio;</hi> but ſhe told me afterwards that which I knew not, namely, that ſhe would have me ſhew her that Lover, whom ſhe beleeved to be at <hi>Naples,</hi> but was ſtill at <hi>Genoua.</hi> This propoſition put me into a ſtrange diſorder; I told her at firſt, that the matter was not eaſie; that it behoved her to have a great deal of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to undertake it; that the apparition of Spirits, which were not at that time in any other but a fantaſticall body, did alwayes bring fear along with it; and that ſhe ſhould think well of that which ſhe deſired, before ſhe undertook it. She anſwered me then, that nothing which reſembled <hi>Hortenſio</hi> could ſcare her. When
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60144:81"/> as I ſaw her obſtinacy, and that I was reduced to that point, as I knew what to ſay the neceſſity wherein I was, rendred me ingenious, and I imagined a trick, which hath ſhewed by the event, that it was well conceived. I told her then with a more open countenance that her confidence pleaſed me; and that I was raviſhed to ſee a perſon of her Sex have a Spirit hardy enough for an enterpriſe which made the boldeſt to tremble. But to make it ſucceed, ſhe was to write a note, according to the tearms which I would dictate unto her, and let me carry it away to make my figures upon it, aſſuring her that I would tear it as ſoon as the myſtery was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that this amongſt the Learned was called, the making of a covenant with the Ideas. She made a little difficulty at it, but having told her how I could doe nothing without that, ſhe conſented thereunto; and by good hap there was a pen and ink in the Cabinet, and a Table-book, wherein we found a white leaf. She began then to write what I dictated unto her, which if I be not deceived was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>

                  <p>Whereas her mind was already pre-occupated with the opinion of my skill, theſe equivocating words, of an Angel of Light, of Darkneſs, of Conjuration, of bleſſed Spirit, of Heaven, of Apparition, of Viſion, and of Fear, failed not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her in this belief. And then too I pronounced all thoſe great words with ſo imperious a tone, as I perceived her to be terrified therewith. After this, I would needs ſee her hand alſo, and would have her fix her looks upon me; I demanded of her the hour and day of her birth, and made many other obſervations, which would be too long to recite. But at laſt, all theſe devices being over, I quitted <hi>Aurelia,</hi> after I had promiſed her that within three nights ſhe ſhould ſee her dear <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> and ſo <hi>Camilla</hi> came to conduct me forth. In traverſing the Garden I obſerved that <hi>Camilla</hi> hid her face with a great deal of care, for fear leſt I ſhould read the ſecret of her heart in her eyes; and when aa I perceived it, I ſaid to her, laughing for the making up of the Comedy, in vain, <hi>Camilla</hi> (for ſo had I heard <hi>Aurelia</hi> call her) doe you ſeek to hide your eyes from me, when as I plainly ſee your heart. Now I beſeech you Sir, ſaid this Wench unto me, mightily ſurpriſed, and that was naturally merry and joviall, if you know my ſecret, doe not tell it unto my Miſtreſs, for then will the poor <hi>Naſtagio</hi> be turned out of doors. I had ſuch a mind to laugh at this ſimplicity of <hi>Camilla,</hi> as I got me out in haſt, for fear I ſhould burſt out into laughter, or be ſtifled in the place, howbeit I told her in going forth that I would be diſcreet. I found <hi>Valerio</hi> in ſo great an impatience to know what I had done, as I could not make him reſolve to ſtay till we came to our Lodging to recount it unto him, for we had not made three ſteps but we ſtood ſtill, ſo that little lacked but we had paſt all the night in the ſtreets; but at length we came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where I recited all this unto him. Bur the pleaſure of it was, that I had been ſo accuſtomed to ſpeak to <hi>Aurelia</hi> in a grave tone, as I delivered every thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him juſt as I had ſaid it. And to make up the matter, there were ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where I was not very certain whether I were not indeed the ſame which I gave out my ſelf to be. When as I ſhewed him <hi>Aurelia's</hi> Letter, he demanded of me what deſign I had in making her to write it? What deſign, ſaid I, even to have it to fall into the hands of <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> who beleeving that <hi>Aurelia</hi> knows he lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed at <hi>Leanders</hi> houſe, in regard ſhe writes unto him, will not fail to be at the place which ſhe hath aſſigned him by her letter, to ſee if he can juſtifie himſelf; and ſo will ſhe learn that he is effectively at <hi>Genoua,</hi> all will break forth, <hi>Liviaes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60144:81"/> pleaſure will be deſtroyed, and I ſhall be revenged. And if it happens that ſhe takes him for a phantaſm, the reputation which you have given me will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the more. <hi>Valerio</hi> acknowledged that this trick was well invented; and <hi>la Roche</hi> mas mad becauſe he had not imagined, or at leaſt conjectured it, upon the ſight of <hi>Aureliaes</hi> letter; but to comfort him for that he had contributed nothing to the adventure which I had incountred, I left him the care to cauſe the letter, which was directed unto <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> to fall into his own hands. Whereupon he told me without further delay, that he would go and carry it to him inſtantly. And when as I demanded of him how he could pretend to obey me ſo readily? He told me how he had learned of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> was this night to go and ſee <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This advice ſeeming to be the beſt we could take, we thought of nothing elſe but of executing it; and for fear leſt ſome miſchance, which we could not foreſee, might happen to my Agent, we followed him a far off in this expedition, which ſucceeded as happily, as the undertaker of it had fortold. For <hi>Hortenſio</hi> retyring very late from <hi>Livia,</hi> we had had the leaſure to attend for him almoſt an hour before he came forth. If the paſſion wherein I had been in for this maid, had been as ſtrong ſtill as it was the day before, I had paſt that time with a great deal of unquietneſs; and I ſhould without doubt have rather given ſome marks of my reſentment to my Rivall, than have cauſed a letter to be delivered unto him; but I never needed four and twenty howers to cure me of ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe I felt then nothing more for <hi>Livia,</hi> but an extreme deſire to trouble her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; ſo that to arrive thereunto, I had as much patience, as was requiſite for me to have in this incounter.

As for <hi>la Roche,</hi> he approched nearer, yet not ſo far from us, but that we might hear all that he ſhould ſay unto him. And whereas it was extreme dark, and that his way tyed him to paſs by the place where we were, we conceived that we ſhould hear, without being perceived, how he would receive this meſſage. As indeed, he was no ſooner come forth but I heard my Agent ſay unto him, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> having underſtood he was in <hi>Genoua,</hi> had ſent him with a letter unto him, which he delivered him; and that ſhe earneſtly deſired him not to fail the aſſignation ſhe had therein given him, for that ſhe would receive no anſwer but from his own mouth; in regard whereof, continued <hi>la Roche,</hi> I may not ſtay to hear any thing you would ſay to me, for ſo am I enjoyned by <hi>Aurelia.

We heard him ſtamp with his foot on the ground, clap his hands together, and ſay with a kind of voyce, which ſhewed both aſtoniſhment and grief; what devill hath diſcovered to <hi>Aurelia</hi> that I was here? It muſt without doubt be an effect of the ſecret paſſion of <hi>Leander,</hi> who hath hoped by ruining me with her to eſtabliſh himſelf in my ſtead. Some three ſteps from thence he ſtood ſtill, and whereas we ſaw that this adventure made him talk like a man beſides himſelf, we reſolved to follow him. This deſign was no ſooner taken, but he began to go on and talk all at an inſtant. What ſaid he, hath my friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me? however I muſt ſee <hi>Aurelia,</hi> to the end I may keep <hi>Leander</hi> from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the fruit of his cunning, and that this incenſed maid may not revenge her ſelf upon <hi>Livia.</hi> She loves me, and I do not doubt but I ſhall pacifie her eaſily enough. But it may be, ſaid he again, that it is not <hi>Aureliaes</hi> letter; let us ſtay, till we can be cleared of it, before we reſolve on any thing. Verily, this manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing by himſelf ſeemed pleaſant enough, howbeit that which I found to be yet better was, that we perceived (for we followed him very cloſe) how though the night was exceeding dark, and that we were in a very narrovv ſtreet, vvhere it vvas ſo obſcure, as nothing could be diſcerned, yet had he broken up the ſeal of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

But the ill luck vvas, that in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it in this ſort he let it fall, and doubtleſs vvith the violence of his action he flung it a good vvay from him, vvithout purpoſing ſo to do, for he ſought for it a pretty vvhile after. We underſtood this accident, both by the diſcourſe vvhich he held, and becauſe he ſtood ſtill. We got us up, <hi>Valerio</hi> and I, againſt the vvall; but I confeſs to you, that this adventure vvas not pleaſing to me: I vvas ſo affraid that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> vvould not ſeek as he ſhould do for the letter, and ſo my deſign ſhould fail, that I may ſay I vvas never in more unquietneſs. Me thought he vvent too far from it to find it; that he had forgot the place vvhere he had let it fall; that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it vvas near to me, though I did not perceive it; in fine, I vvas even vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeek for it vvith him; and my imagination ſo troubled me, as I believed I ſavv it in tvventy places, vvhere certainly it vvas not. And vvhen my mind vvas deceived in this manner, I vvas in a pain that cannot be expreſt; For vvhen as I thought that I ſavv it in a place, I underſtood by <hi>Hortenſioes</hi> going that he vvent from it, vvhich ſo madded me, as I had like to have loſt all patience. But at length, after he had ſought up and down a great while for it, and that he had ſaid an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred things, which would have pleaſed a man that had no intereſt in the affair, I heard him upon a ſuddain ſay with much joy, at laſt I have got you again, and have not loſt my labour: Whereupon he went preſently away, and I retaining <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerio,</hi> who would have continued following him, told him, that if the like ſhould befall me again, I ſhould go wild; that this adventure was both too pleaſing, and too offenſive, for me to be once more expoſed unto it; and that withall we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do with him. We got us away then to our lodging, where we found my Agent, howbeit we went not to bed before we had laughed ſufficiently at the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the letter, and at all that which <hi>Hortenſio</hi> had ſaid in ſeeking for it. In the mean time he was come to <hi>Leanders</hi> houſe, where after he had read the letter, which he knew to be written with her own hand, he was confirmed, as we underſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the deſign of ſeeing her. He beleeved, that all thoſe words, of bleſſed Spirit, Angell of light, and darkneſs, which <hi>Aurelia</hi> had taken for markes of inchantment, were termes of galantry, that could not part from a ſpirit that was much incenſed. He firmly reſolved then to ſee her the night enſuing; and thereby to conſerve her to himſelf, preſerve the reputation of <hi>Livia,</hi> and deſtroy the deſignes of his friend, whom he was perſwaded had betrayed him; for he could not conceive how <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> could come to know any thing of him other waies. But at length day came, which I paſt away with an impatience that holds me ſtill; for though I had the ſame very day two very pleaſant converſations with two men, whereof the one mockt at Aſtrology, to oblige me thereby to ſpeak of it, and the other ſaid that it was the excellenteſt of all Sciences, to carry me to the ſame thing, yet will I not ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for even as I am now talking, I am in haſt to tell you, that aſſoon as the time of <hi>Hortenſioes</hi> aſſignation approched, I went and put my ſelf in ambuſcado, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to ſee the end of my inchantment. Now it hapned, that the weather being extreme hot, <hi>Aurelia</hi> lay in a low room, whoſe grated windowes were upon the ſtreet, and where <hi>Hortenſio</hi> had often talked with her. But, Madam, to give you the full pleaſure of this adventure, I am to tell you, not onely that which I ſaw, and that which I heard, but that which paſt between <hi>Aurelia</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> who recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it afterwards unto us. Aſſoon as <hi>Aurelia</hi> had ſupped, ſhe made as though ſhe were not well, that ſo ſhe might be alone with <hi>Camilla,</hi> and when ſhe was come to her Chamber, this wench asked of her, whether ſhe did indeed believe ſhe ſhould ſee <hi>Hortenſio</hi> that night? For, ſaid ſhe, how can a man that is ſo far diſtant from hence come hitherto you in ſo ſhort a time? The Miſtreſs, who thought her ſelf a great deal more able, laughed to hear her ſay ſo; and took a great care to make her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that this Science was above her underſtanding; and told her moreover, how it would not be effectively <hi>Hortenſio</hi> which ſhe ſhould ſee, but ſomething that ſhould reſemble him ſo perfectly, there would be no difference. Howbeit, ſaid <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi> unto her, vvhat do you hope by ſeeing him ſo? vvhat entertainment? vvhat
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60144:82"/> ſatisfaction do you expect from it? Onely to ſee him, ſaid <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and if thou be wiſe, ſaid ſhe, demand not why Love doth cauſe any thing to be done, for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the reaſon for that which he forces us to do; And then my curioſity is not particular to me, for I have heard of many women that uſe to do ſo.

In the mean time, that he might get her to come back again, and knovving, that ſhe could hear him well enough from the Cabinet where ſhe vvas, he ſaid unto her vvith a languiſhing voice to move her the more; Am I come ſo far then, <hi>Aurelia,</hi> onely to ſee you, and will not you vouchſafe to look on me? Alas!

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60144:83"/> as it were better I ſhould want good manners, then deprive you of the pleaſure of hearing it. I will tell you then, Madam, ſince your ſilence ſeemes to permits me ſo to doe, that <hi>Valerio</hi> had a ſetvant, called <hi>Veſpa,</hi> whoſe inclinations were proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his condition, being of ſomewhat a dull ſpirit; he never came a nights into the chamber where vve vvere, but to help to make his Maſter unready, and then went preſently to lye with <hi>la Roche</hi> in a room which was ſeparated from ours one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thin bords and tapeſtry hangings, ſo that ſpeaking never ſo little lowd one might hear from the one place what vvas ſaid in the other. When <hi>la Roche</hi> and <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> were a bed, this laſt demanded of the other, whether it were true that I knew all that was done in the world, as he had been lately told? <hi>La Roche,</hi> who meant to make himſelf merry with him, aſſured him that it was ſo far true, as that I perfectly knew what any body did, if I did but know the name of the perſon. Alas, ſaid <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> then, I would not be bound to ſerve with ſuch a Maſter! For how ſhould one ſpend his life with a man, to whom one durſt never tell a lye? It is ſomevvhat an hard caſe, ſaid my Agent, ſpeaking a little lovvd, to the end we might hear him; hovvſoever it muſt be ſo. I had as leefe dy, ſaid the other, as have my Maſter know all the lies that I tell him, when as I return from ſome place, where I have ſtayed longer than I ſhould: for, as you knovv, vve vvant not excuſes for the ſtealing of an hower to beſtow in our pleaſures; Mounſieur was not at home; I waited for him a long time; he ſtayed me with a purpoſe to have written to you; I ſought for him in divers places; your clothes were not done; I was to ſee as I went along whither your Gittern vvere ſtrung or no; and ſo, according to the diverſity of occaſions, diverſity of pretexts are alvvaies found: But as for you, I do not ſee hovv you can live; you durſt not, I aſſure my ſelf, entertain tvvo three of your companions vvhilſt he is at the Comedy, and paſs avvay an afternoon in making good chear. I durſt not indeed, anſvvered my Agent, unleſs it vvere at ſuch a time, as I knovv he had great affairs in hand, and ſo had no leiſure to think of me. Neither could you have the pleaſure, ſaid <hi>Veſpa,</hi> to recount his ſecrets; to ſay he is in love vvith ſuch a one; he goes often to ſuch a place; he vvrites to ſuch a perſon; and that which is the vvorſt, if he hath ill intreated you; vvhether it be in revyling you; or in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you vvith the baſtinado; or if occaſion ſerves, in giving you a vvhirret on the ear; you durſt not complain to your friends of it: Whereas to me, it vvould be the depriving me of a great conſolation, if I could not ſay to one; he is more fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call than a Mule; more extravagant than a Hobgoblin; and to give him to all the devills in hell vvhen he is untovvard. For vvhen I have ſaid all this, I return home, as if I vvere vvell revenged, and had ſaid ſo much to him himſelf. As for me, ſaid <hi>la Roche,</hi> mine is none of the vvorſt, and I am ſeldom in the caſe you ſpeak of. I vviſh it may be ſo, replyed the other, hovv ever you muſt needs confeſs, that he vvould very much incommodate me in one thing; for hovv could one ſerve him vvell, or be vvell clothed, if a man ſhould not make ſome profit to himſelf of the money that paſſes through his hands; I ſhould be very ſorry to ſteal ought from any body, but in that caſe I muſt be excuſed. It is not to hord it up, that I take any thing, but to do him credit vvith it; and then the recompences vvhich Maſters make us is not ſo great, but that vve may vvith ſome juſtice recompence our ſelves. For that, ſaid <hi>la Roche,</hi> you have reaſon; and there I loſe a fair oportunity, vvhich you enjoy. You are ſo unhappy too, continued <hi>Veſpa,</hi> that as I perceive you dare not think of quitting him, and of looking out for a Maſter ſecretly, as vve common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, vvhen vve find not our ſelves vvell vvith him vvhom vve ſerve: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I ſhould chuſe rather to be in the gallyes, than in the ſervice of this man: I ſhould not have ſpoken thus freely to you, added he ſmiling, for fear he ſhould have knovvn it, if you had not told me, that he is to knovv the name of them vvhoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets he deſire to knovv; for as for that vvhich I am called by, he vvill be conſened in it, becauſe I took it upon me but vvhen I came to <hi>Genoua,</hi> by reaſon of a ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture vvhich befell me a <hi>Sauonna,</hi> of vvhence I am. You vvould have reaſon for that you ſay, replyed my Agent, vvho vvas vvilling to put him in fear, if he did not know mine; but if to morrovv he ſhould have a deſire to know what I have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60144:83"/> done, he vvould alſo knovv vvhat you have ſayd unto me; for othervviſe his ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvould be very confuſed. Then am I undone, ſayd <hi>Veſpa,</hi> but hovvſoever, if he muſt knovv all that I have ſayd unto you, let him knovv alſo that I never took much from my Maſter at a time, to the end that he may be contented vvith making me to he turned avvay. We burſt out then, <hi>Valerio</hi> and I, into ſuch a laughter, as he could no longer doubt but that vve had heard him vvithout inchantment. And vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there vvas a back-door that opened out of their room upon the ſtaires, he roſe in haſt, and got him avvay, ſo that vve never heard of him after. The reſt of the night vvas ſpent in ſleeping, but the next day I had employment enough; for I vvas ſcarcely out of bed, vvhen as I received a Note from <hi>Aurelia,</hi> whereby ſhe prayed me that ſhe might ſpeak but one word with me at the Garden door, where I had formerly been, out of which ſhe would come forth, and ſeem as though ſhe had met me by chance. I made ſome difficulty of going to her, but at length <hi>Valerio</hi> conſtrained me thereunto. As ſoon as I came at her, being ſtill pale, and amazed with her laſt nights adventure, ſhe ſaid unto me, that having been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed ſince morning, how <hi>Hortenſio</hi> was effectively at <hi>Genoua,</hi> and had never been abſent from thence, ſhe found that ſhe had great cauſe to complain of me, for that I had not undeceived her. Hereupon I was very much perplexed how to anſwer her; but at laſt I told her with civility enough, how it was true that I knew of it, but having promiſed her no more than to let her ſee <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> I never thought of any thing elſe: That if inſtead of this phantoſm ſhe had ſeen the true <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was an undoubted mark of the power of my art, which had conſtrained him to come unto her, though he deſired to be concealed. I acknowledge, ſaid ſhe unto me, that this reaſon is ſo forcible, as I cannot deſtroy it; but ſince it is true, that nothing can reſiſt you, do me the favour that <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> who as I have been told, lyes ſecretly at <hi>Leanders</hi> houſe, that he may go a nights to ſee a mayd whom he loves, may no longer love her; or if it be poſſible, that he may deſpiſe and hate her. This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began to put me into ſuch choller againſt Aſtrology, that little lacked but that I had left <hi>Aurelia</hi> without an anſwer; howbeit my wit ſerved me yet this once again dextrouſly enough: For I aſſured her ſhe was ill informed of the matter, and that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> did not lye concealed for any new love, but that being grown jealous of her, he had feigned a voyage to <hi>Naples,</hi> the more exactly to obſerve her actions; and that without doubt ſhe was beloved of <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> as much as ever ſhe had been. This poor Gentlewoman was ſo ſatisfied with that which I told her, as ſhe verily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; and ſo I left her with a great deal of joy. As I was returning home, I was mightily ſurpriſed, to ſee how the people began to note me, and point at me; ſome ſaying, that I was a learned man; others, that I was half a Prophet; theſe ſame, that I was an Inchanter; thoſe, that I was a Sorcerer. There were ſome too, that not far from the truth, took me for an impoſtor, and ſcoffed at me; at leaſtwiſe I interpreted their looks and their actions ſo. I went then in a rage to find out <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> whom I met withall ſome three or four ſteps from my lodging. I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto him what had hapned to me, but I quarrelled with him for that he was the cauſe of all the confuſion I was in. He, that was ready to burſt with laughter, asked me whether I had not given him order to publiſh my ſcience? Yes, ſayd I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but not to make me paſs for a Magician. You know, ſayd he unto me, ſtill laughing, that Fame augments every thing; and then what is it you complain of? all the world is ſatisfied with your skill, and that which ſhould more content you, you are revenged both of your Rivall and of your Miſtreſs, by giving them ſo much unquietneſs as you do. He had no ſooner ſayd ſo, but <hi>Leander</hi> appeared, and ſeemed to come to us; I would have declined his encounter by entring into my lodging, but <hi>Valerio</hi> told me that he had promiſed him my acquaintance, and that he was too near then for me to avoyd it. Indeed he was ſo near as I could not anſwer <hi>Valerio,</hi> ſo that I was conſtrained to receive the civilities of <hi>Leander,</hi> who after a great and long complement, recounted unto me all his love to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who loved <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> that loved not her, becauſe he was ingaged elſwhere; and therefore he conjured me, as well for his intereſt, as for that of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> ſo to do, that ſhe might no longer affect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60144:84"/> 
                     <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> but accept of his ſervice. I was ſo confounded with all theſe adventures, as I ſcarce knew which way to turn me; howbeit ſeeming to conſider of all that he had told me, at length I aſſured him, that if he continued loving and ſerving her, he ſhould be beloved of her, provided he acquainted her with his paſſion. He went away very well ſatisfied, and <hi>Valerio</hi> demanded of me, how I hoped to keep my word? I anſwered him, that at laſt <hi>Aurelia</hi> would be weary of <hi>Hortenſioes</hi> deſpiſing her; that <hi>Leander</hi> by continuing to ſerve her would touch her heart, and to would think that he obtained that by the power of my art, which was due to his own induſtry. But, ſayd I unto him, now that we have a little reſt, let us go into our lodging; howbeit we were ſcarcely in the middle of the Hall, when turning my head about, I perceived <hi>Leonardo</hi> the father of <hi>Livia,</hi> comming to me with an open countenance, which made me conceive that he had ſomething to demand of me. I received him with a forced civility, which might have made him know, if he had heeded it, that the ſight of him had put me to a non-plus. And to give him yet more liberty to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute me, <hi>Valerio,</hi> who took great pleaſure in all theſe things, made ſhew of taking his leave of me, and went and ſtayed for me in my chamber. Then began <hi>Leonardo</hi> to tell me in a ſerious manner, which vexed me exceedingly, how he was aſhamed that his firſt viſit was to requeſt a favour from me, rather than to let me know that he was in love with the reputation which I had gotten in ſo ſhort a time; but in fine, that he might oblige me by his freedom to uſe the ſame to him, he beſought me that I would caſt a Figure to diſcover who it was that had got an Emerauld Ring which was loſt out of his houſe. I muſt confeſs, that I found my ſelf then in ſo ſtrange a caſe, as if by wiſhing I could have become a Magician indeed, to get out of this croſs adventure, I verily think that I ſhould have wiſhed it. What ſhall I do, ſayd I to my ſelf? What counſell am I to take? And what can I anſvver to ſo preſſing a diſcourſe? It concerns not novv the beguiling of an amorous mayd, or an ignorant Lover; it is an old man that ſayes he knovvs Aſtrology, that vvill diſcover my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as ſoon as I ſhall ſpeak; For to tell him a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After I had determined to doe ſo, I took a more ſerious look upon me for to tell him, how it was true, that heretofore I had underſtood ſome principles of Aſtrology (for I could not reſolve to confeſs my ſelf to be directly an impoſtor) how upon that ground my friends had given me the reputation of knowing ſomewhat; but that none of them had ever any experience of it; how it was true alſo, that I had many times delivered my ſelf to be more knowing than I was, in ſome occaſions, where feigning was rather a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry than a crime; but as for him, I deſired it ſhould appear, that the reputation which I had gained was not ſo dear unto me, as his friendſhip, ſeeing I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ingeniouſly unto him, that I did not know enough either in Aſtrology, or in the other ſciences depending thereupon, for to be able to tell him that which he deſired of me. This diſcourſe ſo clear and true had not the effect I expected from it; for very far from being believed, I heard <hi>Leonardo</hi> ſay unto me ſmiling, Had I not known by the report of others, that you are a learned man, your humility would ſuffice to perſwade me that you know much. I ſwear unto you, ſayd I laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for I could not poſſibly forbear) that I know nothing. Even this which you ſay, anſwered he, is that which confirms me in my belief of you; and thus modeſt and diſcreet, continued he, ought they to be who know much; for their ſcience makes them to be known well enough, without any intermixture of their vanity. If I were what you think me to be, ſayd I interrupting him, I would acknowledge it to you; but it is certain that I do not merit the honour you do me. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told you, anſwered he, that this humility is the greateſt ſcience of all; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ſure, that every man which ſayes he knows a thing well, is ignorant of it, ſince he is arrived at the point to think that he knows it perfectly, But at length let us return to our purpoſe, and permit me to tell you, that this Emerauld is graven, and may ſerve for a Seal as well as for a Ring. I was ſo madded to ſee that when I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60144:84"/> had told lyes, I had been believed, and now that I ſpake truth, I could not be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, as I vvas not able to anſvver him any thing, ſo much was I tranſported with choler and unquietneſs. But he, vvho vvas not repulſed by my ſilence, and that on the contrary conceived hovv I vvas thinking on ſomething to ſatisfie him, ſaid unto me again in a gentler manner than before; You are pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble vvith me upon a premeditated deſign, and I conſent to all that you have ſaid of your ſelf, ſo as I may obtain that vvhich I deſire of you; and to facilitate the buſineſs, ſaid he further unto me, you are to know that this ring vvas loſt between ten and eleven of the clock in the forenoon. Whilſt I was in this caſe, namely in the ſtrangeſt that ever any body was, I ſaw <hi>la Roche</hi> enter with a paper in his hand, who ſaid unto me aloud, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeake a word with me about an important affair. I ſtept then from <hi>Leonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and went to him; but I was joyfully ſurpriſed when I underſtood, that <hi>Lucretia,</hi> for her own intereſt, and the better to keep the jeſt afoot, had advertiſed him that <hi>Leonardo</hi> would come to learn ſome nevvs of me concerning a ring, which his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had given to <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> who had viſited her about ten of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a riding ſuit, making ſhew that he was returned unto <hi>Genoua</hi> by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers command; and that <hi>Leonardo</hi> having found them together, <hi>Hortenſio</hi> had made as though he had loſt a letter, which a brother of his had written him from <hi>Naples;</hi> that after he was gone, <hi>Livia</hi> ſeeming very ſad, and her father having demanded of her what ſhe ayled, ſhe had told him, that the ring, which ſhe had given to <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſio,</hi> was loſt, to the end he ſhould not marvell if he ſaw it no longer. This dicourſe made me wonderfull glad; I took the paper from <hi>la Roche</hi> the better to diſſemble the matter, and uſing a great deal of civility to <hi>Leonardo,</hi> I deſired him to excuſe the liberty which I had taken. He anſwered me, that with him I was juſtified, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I would not refuſe him. I confeſs that the occaſion of gulling him was ſo fair, us I ſhould have had much adoe too forbear; and <hi>Leonardo</hi> too had ſuch a mind to be ſo, as he would have been diſobliged more in not being gulled, than in being gulled; beſides, it was in vain for me to tell him the truth again, which he would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, do what I could. He began again to preſs me; I reſiſted yet a while; but at laſt, when I ſaw that he would needes have me devine, I ſpake to him with more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty than an Aſtrologer, and more clearly than a Oracle, if he would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood me rightly. After I had made a turn in the room without ſpeaking a word, I made a ſtop juſt before him, and ſaid unto him; hitherto I have done what I could to diſſemble the little knowledge I have, that I might not do any thing which would diſpleaſe you; but ſince you will needes know it, I will confeſs freely unto you, that I have already caſt a figure for it upon the intreaty of a kinſwoman of <hi>Liviaes;</hi> ſo that diſguiſing the truth no longer, I am obliged to tell you, that a man, whom you ſaw this morning in a riding ſuit, is he which hath the ring you ſpeak of. Who would ever have believed it, ſaid <hi>Leonardo,</hi> that a man of his faſhion and qualitie, had been capable of ſo ſtrange an action? But young people that have covetous fathers, are many times carried to ill habits by neceſſity; howſoever I muſt find out this ring, and if it be poſſible demand it of him that hath taken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without charging him that he ſtole it. After this diſcourſe he gave me thanks, and made me promiſe to come to ſupper to him. An hower after he was gone, came an old fellow, who had ſerved <hi>Leonardo</hi> about thirty yeares, preſented to me by <hi>la Roche,</hi> that told me with a ſimplicity which made me to laugh, how being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to return into his Country, and carry with him the little money which he had gotten, he beſought me that I would cauſe him and his treaſure to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither in a moment, for fear of robbing by the way. I know enough for that, ſaid my Agent then, without my Maſters medling in it; and when I had confirmed him in this opinion, away they went together. But whilſt <hi>Valerio</hi> laughed at my adventure, and I was thinking how I might finiſh it, the poor <hi>Hortenſio</hi> paſt not his time away ſo well. For it fell out that <hi>Leonardo</hi> had incountred him juſt as he went out of my lodging; howbeit he accoſted him civilly, and ſaid no more to him but that he had been an hower in ſeeking of him: For <hi>Hortenſioes</hi> countenance ſo little
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60144:85"/> reſembled that of a thief, as he was ſomewhat affraid to ſpeak to him. <hi>Hortenſio</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thereunto, that he would think himſelf happy, if it were to command him any thing. How curteous he is? (thought <hi>Leonardo</hi> vvith himſelf as he delivered to me aftervvard) and vvhat a pitty it is, that ſo handſom a man ſhould have ſo bad an inclination? Then taking courage, he ſaid unto him, that having underſtood there vvas a ring in his hands, vvhich had been loſt out of his houſe, he deſired he might ſee it. And vvhereas <hi>Hortenſio</hi> vvas ſurpriſed vvith this diſcourſe, he ſeemed to be ſo confounded, as <hi>Leonardo</hi> no longer doubted but that he vvas guilty. O me! cryed <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> what is this I hear? I do not ſay, replyed <hi>Leonardo,</hi> that you are faulty, but the party from whom you had it. How unhappy am I, ſaid <hi>Hortenſio</hi> interrupting him? Afflict not your ſelf, replyed <hi>Leonardo,</hi> for the hand which gave it you, hath alone committed this fault, and ſo you are juſtified with me. Whilſt <hi>Leonardo</hi> did what he could to conceal from him the bad opinion he had of him, he was perſwaded, that this man knew the truth of the matter; and to juſtifie <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> as much as poſſibly he could, he aſſured him that he alone was culpable; that he alone had deceived him; that he denyed not but that this ring was in his hands; and therefore he acknowledged he had juſt cauſe to complain of him. This is ſtrange, ſaid <hi>Leonardo</hi> to himſelf, that the more I would excuſe him, the more he accuſes himſelf! I ſay it to you again, continued the other, that I alone am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of puniſhment. No <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> ſayd <hi>Leonardo,</hi> you ſhall not perſwade me to it; for I am well informed of the truth of the buſineſs. Why then it is beſt for me, anſwered <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> not to make any further deniall, but in reſtoring you the ring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ingenuouſly that I was conſtrained by an inevitable neceſſity, to do you this wrong. I know well enough, replyed, <hi>Leonardo,</hi> what youth is capable of, and what neceſſity will make one doe. <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Leonardo</hi> ſpeak ſo gently unto him, and believing, ſo ill did they underſtand one another, that he knew all which had paſt between <hi>Livia</hi> and him, believed alſo that he was to make his profit of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and to ſpeak plainly unto him. Since you know, ſaid he to him, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my errors, will you be pleaſed to render them legitimate, in giving me leave to marry <hi>Livia?</hi> you know my birth, and you may know my eſtate when you pleaſe. Marry my daughter! cryed <hi>Leonardo,</hi> this propoſition is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, as our converſation ſhall end there, for I do not think that you have reaſon to continue it any longer, after I have aſſured you nevertheleſs that I ſhall be diſcreet. Saying ſo, the old man went away, and left <hi>Hortenſio</hi> more amazed, than ever he was in his life, for he no way apprehended that <hi>Leonardo</hi> would accuſe him of theft; and to perplex him yet further, <hi>Aurelia</hi> appeared, who believing, according as I had told her, that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> had not concealed himſelf but becauſe he was jealous, would <hi>en paſſant</hi> have ſaid ſome manner of gallanterie unto him. But he, who was not in a caſe to diſſemble, and that ſaw well enough how his love to <hi>Livia</hi> was upon breaking forth, ſaid unto her ſomewhat rudely; you drove me away at ſuch time as by your direction I came to wait upon you, think it not ſtrange then if after that I never do ſee you more; and to recompence the love which you have borne me with ſome freeneſs, know, that I am ingaged in an affection, which cannot end but with my life. This ſaid, he left her, for to go in all haſt and try if he could ſee <hi>Livia,</hi> to the end they might adviſe together about what they were to do in ſo croſs an adventure. In the mean time, <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſo replyed upon my words, as ſhe had much adoe to believe but that <hi>Hortenſioes</hi> deſpiſall was a mark of love. As ſhe was returning home in this irreſolution, ſhe incountred <hi>Leander,</hi> vvho had ſeen <hi>Hortenſio</hi> enter into <hi>Liviaes</hi> houſe, and <hi>Leonardo</hi> preſently following in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; ſo that inforced by his paſſion, and my counſell, he diſcovered unto her the truth of the Hiſtory: He informed her how it was by his meanes ſhe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed in the morning, that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> never parted from <hi>Genoua;</hi> and that to let her ſee how <hi>Livia</hi> wholly poſſeſſed his heart, he knew for a certain that he was at that inſtant with her; having ſaid to him juſt as he was going in, and he paſſing by, I will no longer oppoſe your love. This diſcourſe ſo netled <hi>Aurelia,</hi> as ſuddainly ſhe felt a ſtrange revolution in her mind: After ſhe had muſed a little, and ſhewed by her
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60144:85"/> countenance how great a combat ſhe had in her heart, ſhe addreſſed her ſpeech to <hi>Leander;</hi> If that which you tell me be true, ſaid ſhe unto him, I confeſs that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> is not only unworthy of my affection, but is alſo unworthy to live. If you did not ſeem to me ſomewhat intereſſed in this encounter, your word alone ſhould ſuffice to make me give credit to all things; but in this, where you are the accuſer, mine ovvn eyes muſt be the vvitneſſes of his crime, if you will have them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable judges to you: conduct me to <hi>Liviaes</hi> houſe, and be aſſured that as ſoon as I have diſturbed their felicity, for I mean to do it, I will eſtabliſh yours. <hi>Leander,</hi> who would gladly have done more difficult things, for the hope of a prize that vvas ſo dear unto him, told her vvith a great deal of reſpect, joy, and love, that he vvas ready to obey her. In the mean time it had fallen out, that vvithin a minute after <hi>Hortenſio</hi> vvas gone in to <hi>Livia, Leonardo</hi> came home; ſo as he had no more leaſure but to let her knovv that her father had demanded the Ring of him, vvhich ſhe had given him, and that he had uſed all his endeavour to dravv the crime vvholly upon himſelf; for as ſoon as <hi>Lucretia</hi> perceived <hi>Leonardo,</hi> ſhe advertiſed them of it; vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hortenſio</hi> vvas conſtrained to hide himſelf in a corner of the Garden vvhere they vvere, it being impoſſible for him to get forth vvithout being ſeen. When ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time approached, I vvent thither; for I vvas not ſorry to ſeek for an occaſion of ſeeing in vvhat caſe <hi>Livia</hi> vvas in af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er ſo many odd adventures; as I vvas going along I met vvith <hi>la Roche,</hi> vvho told me that he came from vvorking his inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the man who vvas afraid of robbing by the vvay; that after a thouſand devices, he had made him get a ſtride upon a pale, as it were upon an horſe; and there having bound up his eyes, and tyed both his hands and his feet, he left him talking the maddeſt things in the world, out of a conceit he had that he was flying in the air; and that to keep him from being robbed by the way, he had taken his money from him without his perceiving it. I rebuked him for his foolery, and having commanded him to follow me, I entered into <hi>Leonardoes</hi> houſe, juſt as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accoſt his daughter, who ſeeing me, would have pulled dovvn her Vail over her face, but he not permitting her ſo to do, told her, that a man, to whom ſhe was ingaged for the recovery of a Ring which was ſo dear unto her, well deſerved to have the pleaſure of beholding her. We were both of us then very much abaſhed, for I knew nothing of that which had paſt betwixt him and <hi>Hortenſio;</hi> and ſhe feared that her father would give her ſome cruel check or other. Howbeit I was not ſo taken up, but that I heard, in regard I was advertiſed of it before, hovv the poor ſimpleton vvhom <hi>la Roche</hi> had tyed up in this garden, ſayd, that he had diſpatched a great deal of vvay already; and I find, continued he, hearing us talk a far off where we were, that I fly very high, for the ſound of voyces doth diminiſh. In the mean time we were mightily ſurpriſed to ſee <hi>Aurelia,</hi> led by <hi>Leander,</hi> come in, who appearing with an angry countenance put the whole company into a great confuſion. <hi>Leonardo,</hi> who perceived that this viſit was not made in an accuſtomed hour, could not imagine the cauſe of it; <hi>Livia,</hi> who before time had had ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and knew that <hi>Hortenſio</hi> was not above five or ſix ſteps from thence in a green Arbor, could not tell what to think of it; <hi>Leander</hi> though he was very certain that he had ſeen <hi>Hortenſio</hi> enter there, and <hi>Leonardo</hi> follow him, yet was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that he ſhould not keep his word with <hi>Aurelia; Hortenſio,</hi> albeit he were hid, was not in the leaſt pain, for that he could not doubt but that he ſhould have ſome ſhare in <hi>Aureliaes</hi> viſit; <hi>la Roche</hi> too was not very much at eaſe to ſee ſo great a company in the very ſame place where his traveller was, which ſtill continued pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though not heard of any but my ſelf, who in concluſion was not without a great deal of unquietnes, to behold ſo many folks together, which in all likelyhood would complain of me. Theſe ſeverall reaſonings, which I have declared unto you, were made for all that in one inſtant, for we were not long without knowing wherefore <hi>Aurelia</hi> came; who, having neither father nor mother, &amp; living only under the tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an uncle, took more liberty to her ſelf than ordinarily the Mayds of <hi>Italy</hi> uſe to do. She advanced then with a boldneſs that amazed me, and addreſſing her ſpeech to <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60144:86"/> unto him, <hi>Leonardo,</hi> to ſee this viſit made to you, rather than to your daughter; ſeeing it is from you that I expect the revenge I deſire. You are abuſed, <hi>Leonardo,</hi> and I am deſpiſed by a man whom <hi>Livia</hi> loves, and who at this preſent is hidden ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where here about your houſe; I deſired to advertiſe you of it, that we might both of us be revenged together. This diſcourſe dejected <hi>Livia;</hi> made <hi>Leonardo</hi> knit his brows; <hi>Leander</hi> ſhrink up his ſhoulder; <hi>Lucretia</hi> give back; as for <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> it is eaſie to imagine that he was but in an ill taking; and touching my ſelf, in the middeſt of the amazement wherein I was, I felt ſome joy in hoping to ſee an end of this adventure; in the mean time I could not chuſe but hear the new <hi>Aſtolpho</hi> ſay, what lamentable voyces are theſe, and into what a fright do they put me, ah, <hi>la Roche,</hi> am I to fear nothing? At length, <hi>Leonardo,</hi> being come out of the aſtoniſhment which had ſeized upon him, beheld <hi>Aurelia</hi> with fury, and taking her by the hand, What, ſaid he unto her, a man hid about my houſe! we muſt ſeek every where, for I will not have this ſuſpition reſt with any body; come, <hi>Aurelia,</hi> that I may revenge you, or be revenged on you, if that which you tell me be not true. What a confuſion of voyces is here, ſayd the Traveller? In the mean ſpace <hi>Leonardo</hi> commanded all the doors to be ſhut, and leading <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and cauſing <hi>Livia</hi> with all the reſt of the company to follow, he began firſt to ſearch in the Garden. We had not gone four ſteps, but they perceived this man tyed on the pale, who made a great coil as it were to go the faſter. The ſight of him arreſting all the troup, <hi>Leonardo</hi> asked whether this was his daughters Lover; <hi>Aurelia</hi> looked on <hi>Leander; Livia</hi> began to take a little heart, hoping they would ſearch no further, and ſo <hi>Hortenſio</hi> would not be found. But going formoſt, I untyed the poor ſot, and ſaid to <hi>Leonardo,</hi> that this was without doubt the knavery of my ſervant, who was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make ſport with the ſimplicity of this man. He was no ſooner untyed, but following his imagination, Behold, ſayd he, how at length I am come into my Country; it is fit I ſhould kiſs the earth where firſt I drew my breath. And when as <hi>Leonardo</hi> demanded of him, what it was that he did. Alaſs! Maſter, ſayd he, are you alſo come into my Country, with all this goodly company? <hi>La Roche</hi> approaching ſayd to him ſoftly, you have not done all that I enjoyned you, for do not you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that you are ſtill at <hi>Genoua</hi> The poor wretch grew then ſo aſtoniſhed as he could not anſwer a word. In the mean time <hi>Aurelia</hi> having told <hi>Leonardo,</hi> that this was not he ſhe ſought for, we continued going on. And when <hi>Leonardo</hi> had demanded whether there were nothing behind a Jaſmin hedge which vvas right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> vvho ſavv that he ſhould be diſcovered, becauſe the Arbor vvhere he vvas hidden vvas hard by it, reſolved to ſhevv himſelf, rather than to be taken vvith the manner. He vvent forth then boldly, and ſpeaking to <hi>Leonardo;</hi> Seek no further, ſayd he unto him, I am he alone who is hidden here, and that will not oppoſe the revenge which you will take of me for it. This is not amiſs, ſayd <hi>Leonardo</hi> to me, I ſeek for my daughters Lover, and I find a Thief. You think peradventure, ſayd he unto him, to ſteal another Ring from me, but I will keep you well enough from it; and in the conſideration of your Father, who is a man of honour, I will onely ſecure my ſelf of your perſon. <hi>Aurelia</hi> thought <hi>Leonardo</hi> was wild, in taking <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſio</hi> for a thief; <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Livia</hi> beleeved the ſame thing; <hi>Hortenſio</hi> himſelf knew not what he meant by it; and I alone was he that could clear this Enigma. And as I was preparing to ſpeak, <hi>Hortenſio</hi> ſaid to <hi>Leonardo,</hi> that he had loved his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two years; that he had had the Ring from her; that he was no thief; and that he might know of her whether he told the truth or no. <hi>Aurelia</hi> would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but choler would not ſuffer her; <hi>Livia</hi> indeed had love enough to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that which <hi>Hortenſio</hi> ſayd, but ſhe was retained by ſhame, howbeit ſhe was fain to ſurmount it, when her Father asked of her, whither that which he heard was true? for ſhe anſwered, how hoping that this mariage would not diſpleaſe him, it was true that ſhe had given him that Ring for the firſt obligation thereof. <hi>Leonardo</hi> had no ſooner received his daughters anſwer, but taking me aſide he conſulted with me about what he ought to do in this encounter; for he did not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me as yet. I confeſs, that then I took pitty of all the diſpleaſures I had done
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60144:86"/> them, and in that good thought, I counſelled him for the honour of his daughter, to mary them together. He told me how that indeed was the cuſtom of <hi>Italie,</hi> and that he was glad my advice was conformable to the uſe of the Country, which in theſe occaſions will have them to be either poniarded or maryed. <hi>Leonardo</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on the laſt, came to them again with a calmer countenance, and making ſome excuſes to <hi>Aurelia</hi> for that he did not revenge her, he told <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> that for my ſake he not only pardoned him, but alſo promiſed him his daughter. Theſe two Lovers were ſo ſatisfied, and ſo pleaſingly ſurpriſed, as it was impoſsible for them to expreſs their joy; <hi>Leander</hi> was ſo contented in ſeeing no further an obſtacle to his love, as he preſently ſummoned <hi>Aurelia</hi> to the performance of her word, who confirmed it unto him with generoſity enough. But the beſt in this generall rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was, that <hi>Livia,</hi> in a gallantery, came, and ſmiling ſayd unto me, I counſel you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time to rely more on your merit than on your ſcience, ſince though you have wholly employed it for the interrupting of my mariage, yet you ſee that your Art is deceitfull. And continued <hi>Aurelia,</hi> in ſomewhat a ſharper manner, you aſſured me that I was beloved of <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> whereas I no ſooner encountred him, but I ſee him maryed to another, which ſhews that your Aſtrology is falſe. As for me, ſaid <hi>Leander,</hi> you perſwaded me that <hi>Aurelia</hi> did not love <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> in the mean time the proof ſhe hath rendred of the contrary, teſtifyes the untruth of your books. And for my part, ſayd the Traveller, he promiſed to ſend me into my country without any danger of robbing, and lo I am ſtill at <hi>Genoua.</hi> All this was ſpoken to me ſo precipitouſly as I was ſurpriſed with it; nevertheleſs being fully reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue no longer an Aſtrologer, I made uſe of this occaſion; for cauſing <hi>Lucretia</hi> to approach, that ſhe might witneſs that which I meant to ſay, I beſought <hi>Leonardo</hi> to pardon me for that I was going to confeſs unto him, ſeeing my gullerie had had ſo happy an end for him; and that he would call to mind how it was not long of me, that he did not believe me to be no Aſtrologer. I recounted unto them my love to <hi>Livia;</hi> in what manner I knew her ſecret, and conſequently all that I have told you. And after I had obtained <hi>Lucretiaes</hi> pardon as well as mine ovvn, I made it appear that I had ſatisfied them without Aſtrology: For, ſayd I to <hi>Leonardo,</hi> you asked me for your Ring, and I have made you to find it; to <hi>Livia,</hi> I have told you the moſt concealed particulars of your adventure; to <hi>Leander,</hi> I made you hope for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> which ſhe promiſes to you her ſelf; to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> I have undeceived you from <hi>Hortenſio,</hi> and made you acknowledge the fidelity of <hi>Leander;</hi> to the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I promiſed you that you ſhould not be robbed by the way, and I have kept my vvord with you; for I am ſure you are not in caſe ſo to be, <hi>la Roche</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for that by taking away your mony, vvhich I command him to reſtore unto you preſently; ſo that you ſee I have not failed in my promiſe to every one: for touching my ſelf, ſayd I laughing, you perceive I am he alone for whom I have done nothing; ſo that to recompence me in ſome ſort for ſo many unprofitable pains, grant me <hi>Valerioes</hi> pardon, vvhich eſpecially I demand of <hi>Leander,</hi> as of the moſt offended, but withall the moſt obliged to his friends gullery, ſince without him he durſt never have thought of the happineſs which he poſſeſſeth. In concluſion, ſaid I to them ſtill laughing, whereas you know that I am a dangerous enemy, I counſell you, as perſons whom I eſteem, to receive me for your friend. They burſt out then into ſo great a laughter, as they thought they ſhould never have been quiet again to hear the complement, which <hi>Leonardo</hi> made me, who aſſured me that the pleaſure I had given him by my relation, was ſo great, as he ſhould alwaies remember it, as an important ſervice which I had rendred him, and that he would not for any thing but that this gullery had been, it was ſo diverting: <hi>Livia</hi> told me next, that ſhe was of her fathers mind, and though ſhe had denyed me her love, yet did ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me her friendſhip; <hi>Hortenſio</hi> added thereunto, that he was ſo much obliged unto me for drawing him out of priſon, as he could not chuſe but ſwear an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable affection to me; and <hi>Leander,</hi> vvho was engaged to me for the poſſeſſion of his Miſtreſs, gave himſelf wholly unto me; for <hi>Aurelia,</hi> as ſhe was leaſt ſatisfied, ſo was her complement the coldeſt, being contented onely to tell me, that ſhe ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60144:87"/> never forget the viſit I had given her, but nevertheleſs whenſoever ſhe had any hate, it ſhould not be for me; whereupon ſhe would have gone away, but I adviſed <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi> to ſend for <hi>Cinthio</hi> her Uncle, and alſo for <hi>Valerio,</hi> to the end they ſhould not part aſunder till all things were peaceably concluded. This was almoſt as ſoon exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as I had mentioned it; in the mean time <hi>Livia</hi> and <hi>Aurelia,</hi> having talked a pretty while together alone, called <hi>Hortenſio</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> to them, and ſuch things paſſed between them, as they found themſelves all four extremely contented. <hi>Cinthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs that which troubled me afterwards was, how not able to keep the matter from being divulged, the ſame people who had pointed at me before as at a Magician, looked upon me then as on an impoſtor, and jeered me in ſuch ſort as I durſt not peep out of doors. But it is alſo true, that the ſame adventure was the cauſe of a greater good unto me; for by the Count of <hi>Lauagnes</hi> curioſity I got the honour of his acquaintance and friendſhip, which hath likewiſe produced yours too, Madam, and hath alſo given me the nobleſt paſſion that ever I had in my life. I muſt confeſs, ſayd the Princeſs, that you are incomparable, and that in regard of what I have heard, there is none but will ſay how you are a dangerous enemy, and a pleaſing friend. Ah, Madam, ſayd the Marquis, do not ruin me with <hi>Aemilia!</hi> no, no, ſayd this mayd, for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you not to judge of you but by your ſelf, who, as I beleeve, will perſwade me that, which her Excellency ſpeaks of, better than ſhe can, as eloquent as ſhe is. I would fain know, ſayd <hi>Doria,</hi> ſpeaking to the Marquis, whether they from vvhom you take your love, may pretend ſtill to your friendſhip. Yes, anſwered he, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they have been favourable to me; for as for the reſt, they are ſo indifferent unto me, as it would be more advantageous for them, that I ſhould hate them. This is a pretty diſcourſe indeed, ſayd <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> ſince that by this reaſon, the fair <hi>Aemiliae</hi> ought not to be cruell unto you, to the end ſhe may by receiving your love favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably pretend one day to your friendſhip. I confeſs, ſaid the Count, that the Marquis his opinion teaches me a new tenet, which I did not beleeve could be poſſible; I have always heard it ſayd, that friendſhip is many times a way to love, but that love ſhould be the way to friendſhip, is a thing which hath but few examples, and no reaſon at all. This diſpute would be a little too long, ſayd the Princeſs, both for the time and the place, and I think it were fitter for us to return unto <hi>Monaco</hi> before the ending of the day, which will not permit us to walk; but this agreeable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hath given us ſo much ſatisfaction, as we have no reaſon to regret it. The whole company then aroſe; the Count led <hi>Iſabella;</hi> the Marquis <hi>Aemilia; Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> went together; and the Princeſſes women, together with other of her ſervants, followed after without order. All this fair troop went aboord of the Galley which brought them thither, whereof the Princeſs never made uſe, but when ſhe went to this place The reſt of the evening was wholly imployed in talking of the Marquis his adventures, each one repeating in particular that which had ſeemed moſt pleaſant to them therein. <hi>Iſabella</hi> likewiſe cauſed her kinſwoman, who had an excellent voyce, to ſing; the Marquis plaid on the Lute, and ſung alſo with the beautiful <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia;</hi> ſo that concluding this day with Muſick, they bid the Princeſs good night, and retired to their lodgings.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60144:88"/> unto her during ſo long an abſence. Alas! ſaid ſhe unto him, what do you ask of me? Doth it not ſuffice that you know you were not here; that I believed you to be either inconſtant, or dead; and that being in a place wherinto I could forbid an entrance to all the world, I have ſcarce had any other adventure, than to weep all day long, at leaſtwiſe ſince the death of my mother, and the unlucky love of the Prince of <hi>Maſſeran,</hi> which <hi>Doria</hi> hath recounted unto you, as alſo that of ſome other Soveraignes of <hi>Italy,</hi> where nothing hath paſt more remarkeable, than the coldneſs which I have uſed towards them. And truly in ſo auſtere a ſolitarineſs, I wanted not imployment; the remembrance of our felicities paſt, and of our then miſeries, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me but with too much entertainment of my ſelf: and I may ſay that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our good fortune was more cruell to me, than the ſenſe of our ill fortune. But, continued ſhe, theſe thoughts are too dolefull, for ſo happy a ſeaſon as this is, wherein I ſee you; and we are not yet ſo far eloigned from the time in which we thought to have ſuffered ſhipwrack, as to look upon this Sea without dread or grief. The adventure of the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and of <hi>Don Fernando de Mendoza,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi> interrupting her, is not ſo inconſiderable, as that you ſhould not be obliged to impart it unto a perſon who hath rendred you ſo exact an account of his life; but if either your modeſty, or your compaſſion, doth hinder you from acquainting him with the effects of your beauty, and the miſchiefes which you have cauſed without thinking of them, I do offer to make him a faithfull recitall thereof. You will be unjuſt, Madam, anſwered <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> if you will not permit that I ſhall know what hath befallen you, and you will give me cauſe to fear that remembrance of ſome one of my Rivalls doth touch you but too ſenſibly. The Princeſs did what ſhe could to remit the matter to another time; but <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who ſought to ſhun the occaſions of ſpeaking of the end of his adventures, was willing to oblige the Princeſs to let him underſtand hers.

                  <p>SEeing the Princeſs hath commanded me to render you an account of her life, I am very willing to obey her, having nothing to tell you that is not advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for her, and alſo for you. I will not repeat her firſt adventures, ſince I know that you are not ignorant of the Prince of <hi>Maſſerans</hi> love, <hi>Juliaes</hi> violence and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, <hi>Felicianaes</hi> treaſon, <hi>Doriaes</hi> generous reſentment, the death of that infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lover, and conſequently that of <hi>Julia.</hi> But I will onely tell you, that when ſhe ſaw ſhe was Miſtreſs of her ſelf, by the loſs of her mother, and that ſhe had in vain ſent to ſeek for you in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſhe reſolved to go no more to <hi>Genoua,</hi> but to live alwaies at <hi>Monaco</hi> to avoid the counſells and propoſitions, which ſhe foreſaw would be urged upon her for to draw her to mary, though ſhe had ingaged her faith to you. For whereas your long abſence had made all the world believe that you were dead, there wanted no reaſons to be alleged unto her for the perſwading of her to the change of her reſolution. As indeed, notwithſtanding all the care ſhe had taken, to bar an entrance into <hi>Monaco</hi> of all thoſe which might ſpeak to her of ſuch like matters, yet the fame of her beauty and vertue was ſpread abroad in ſuch manner, as there was not a Prince in all <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſent not unto her for a permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to viſit and ſerve her. But ſhe, who feared her Lovers more than her Enemies, brought ſo much care to the fruſtrating of all their deſignes, as none of them could ever obtain ſo much as the liberty to ſee her. She lived in this auſtere retiredneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time, as about a year ago, or little leſs, there ran a rumor in <hi>Genoua</hi> that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60144:88"/> you had been ſeen at <hi>Naples;</hi> whereupon ſhe ſent the Lieutenant of her guard unto you, who, as you know, found you in a place far from that where he vvent to ſeek you. It vvas much about that time, vvhen as, having loſt my mother, I came againſt the Princeſſes mind, to ſhut up my ſelf vvith her, ſhe being unvvilling, as ſhe ſaid, that I ſhould be made unhappy for her ſake. But do vvhat ſhe could, my intreaties vvere ſtronger than her reaſons, ſo that ſhe vvas contented to accord me that, which I demanded of her with ſo much affection. That falſe newes which had been reported of you gave her a true joy, and made her with the more caſe conſtrain her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not ſeem to be ſo melancholy as before. But to the end her retiredneſs might be the more ſupportable to me, ſhe walked oftner than ſhe was wont to doe; ſhe retired leſs into her Cabinet, for the entertaining of her thoughts; and her compliance for me, together with the ſecret hope ſhe had of ſeeing you again, wrought ſo powerfully upon her mind, as they diſſipated a part of her grief, and put her ſoul into a more peaceable eſtate. She took pleaſure in recounting to me your firſt adventures; ſhe ſhewed me your letters, and the verſes which you had made for her; and by the praiſes which I gave them, I quickly got more eſteem, and love, from her than I had before. She ſuffered me alſo ſometimes to ſing an ayr unto her; and whereas ſhe called to mind the paſſion which you had ever had for muſick, I dare ſay, how it was more for the love of you, than for the love of me, that ſhe retained one of your Rivalls in her ſervice. <hi>Aemilia,</hi> perceiving that this diſcourſe had made <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> change colour, could not forbear laughing at it; and deſiring to draw him out of the pain whereinto ſhe had put him; Be patient, ſaid ſhe unto him, and judge not precipitouſly of a matter, for which you will afterwards without doubt repent you. I know, anſwered <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> that I ſhould be unjuſt in deſiring to be a judge of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but I know withall that fear is inſeparable from love, and that in this occaſion I ought to give you ſome marks of it. I vvill ſoon make it ceaſe, continued <hi>Aemilia,</hi> but prepare your ſelf to underſtand the moſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick adventure, and the ſtrangeſt incounter, that ever you heard off: You are to know then, ſaid ſhe going on, how that great reputation of beauty which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had all over <hi>Italy,</hi> begot a curioſity at one and the ſame time in the mindes of the young Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando de Mendoza,</hi> vvho for a long time had been in the War of <hi>Milan</hi> under the Marquis of <hi>Gnaſt;</hi> and albeit they knevv not one another; though the one vvas of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the other of <hi>Spain;</hi> though the firſt vvas at <hi>Naples,</hi> and the other at <hi>Milan;</hi> yet took they both of them the ſame reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> vvas handſom, of a good mine, and full of ſpirit; and whereas in ſtudying the Mathematicks, he had learned to deſign, he had afterwards applyed himſelf to painting, and was become ſo excellent in that art, as few Maſters in <hi>Italy</hi> had done braver things than he. This young Prince being reſolved to ſee whether fame did not flatter the Princeſs, and knowing by the example of others, that it would be no boot for him to preſent himſelf at <hi>Monaco</hi> with an equipage proportionable to his condition, he concluded to go thither diſguiſed; and that he might the eaſilier find out the meanes to approch unto the Princeſs, he purpoſed to ſay that he was a Painter. <hi>Don Fernando de Mendozo,</hi> as I have already declared, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a like deſire, and a like curioſity, uſed alſo the ſame meanes to content it: For as the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> would paſs for a Painter, ſo would <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who underſtood muſick perfectly, paſs for a Muſician. They diſguiſed themſelves then after the manner they had reſolved on, and without knowing ought of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they came to <hi>Monaco</hi> at the time which I have noted; and when as the hope of ſeeing you again, and the Princeſſes compliance for me, had rendred her melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ſociable. The firſt that arrived at <hi>Monaco</hi> was <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who retained this name onely, leaving that of <hi>Mendoza,</hi> as too illuſtrious for him whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be. And whereas the Princeſs had ordained a long time before, that no ſtranger ſhould enter into the Town, without firſt advertiſing her of it, they came preſently and told her, that a man, which gave himſelf out to be a Muſician, deſired to enter. At firſt ſhe thought not to have ſeen him, but as for me, who had no other deſign but to delight her, I beſought her to command he might be admitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60144:89"/> to the end we might ſee whether he were skillfull enough to keep me from forgetting that which I had already learned in Muſick; and to oblige her not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me, I cauſed her to remember the paſſion which ſhe had told me you had ever had for this excellent art; and it was without doubt that in this ſort the ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of you introduced <hi>Don Fernando</hi> into the Caſtle, although the Princeſs had the goodneſs to tell me, that ſhe ſhould be very glad there could any thing be met withall, which could keep me from being weary of <hi>Monaco.</hi> But in the end, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> appeared, and albeit both the Princeſs and my ſelf found ſomething that was great in his countenance, yet ſuſpected we nothing of the truth, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that lofty ayr to the Nation, whereof he ſaid he was; for he did not conceal himſelf from being a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in regard, though he ſpake <hi>Italian</hi> well enough, he would yet have been known by his pronunciation. The Princeſs demanded of him, of whence he was, whether he was going, what he could doe; and to all thoſe particulars he anſwered exactly. As for his ſcience, he deſired the Princeſs that ſhe would be the judge of it, and hear him ſing. She would fain have referred her ſelf to me, but giving her no leiſure to command me unto it, I ſent for a Violl and a Lute, to the end he might ſhew us what he could doe. I well obſerved, how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Princeſs with a great deal of attention, and alſo how he bluſhed two or three times. But whereas the greateſt beauties ſtrike every one with admiration, I took his bluſhing for a mark of his reſpect, and his attention for an ordinary effect of <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> beauty. When that was brought which I had ſent for, he took a Lute, and truly touched it reaſonably well; but when he had plaid on it, and that to ſing he had taken a Violl in his hand, he perſwaded us yet better by his play, that he was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than he had done by his pronunciation, it being moſt certain that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to play better: He ſung alſo with a very good grace, and with much art; As for me, I confeſs unto you that I was raviſhed with it. And whereas the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs perceived the ſatisfaction that I received by it, and was reſolved to pleaſe me as much as ſhe could, ſhe demanded of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> whether he would abide with her for ſome time to be my Maſter? He very vvell contented with this propoſition, told her, that ſhe did him too much honor, and though his purpoſe was not to make any ſtay at <hi>Monaco,</hi> yet ſhould he eſteem himſelf infinitely happy, if he could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to render her any ſervice. Thus ſee you <hi>Don Fernando</hi> lodged in the Caſtle, and in the rank of the Princeſſes domeſticall ſervants, but more yet, of that of her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. For as we know afterwards, he became ſo deſperately in love with her, as he reſolved to do all that he might for to gain her to himſelf, by any way whatſoever. Certain dayes after, the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who gave himſelf the name of <hi>Lucilio,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived alſo at <hi>Monaco,</hi> and according to order it was told the Princeſs, hovv there vvas a young Painter, vvho ſaid, he came from <hi>Rome,</hi> that deſired to ſhevv her ſome ſmall pieces of his ovvn dravving. She vvho, as I have already declared, ſought to delight me, commanded him to be brought to her; <hi>Don Fernando</hi> vvas at that time in the Princeſſes chamber, vvhom I had cauſed to come thither to hear a Spaniſh ayr, vvhich had extremely pleaſed me. The Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> being come to the Caſtle, entred into the room, where we were, with a profound reſpect, and ſhewed the Princeſs two ſmall pieces of his drawing, admirably well done. In the firſt was ſeen a Sea repreſented, whoſe waves ſeemed to be very much moved, and a far of on the ſhore a man, who, manger the counſell of divers perſons, which ſeemed by their actions to hinder him from it, leapt into a skiff, and abandoned himſelf to the fury of the Sea, ſhewing them with one hand the point of a Rock, which ſtood up in the midſt of this Sea, as if he had a deſire to go and ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack there. The ſecond picture was an <hi>Icarus,</hi> of an extraordinary deſign; and though the firſt piece expounded unto us that of the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> yet did we not underſtand any part of that emblem; and the Princeſs, without comprehending ought that was myſterious therein, exceedingly commended his work. For, as you know, ſhe might be a competent judge of ſuch like things, in regard ſhe herſelf could paint very well, though ſince your departure ſhe hath wrought ſo little, as one may ſay, ſhe hath nothing left but the bare knowledge of that rare art, having
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60144:89"/> utterly loſt the uſe of applying the colours. In the mean time the Princeſs finding thoſe two pieces to her mind, bought them to beſtow on me. And having deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this pretended Painter, whether he could work in great, as well as in little, and he anſwering that it was ordinary with him, ſhe reſolved to have him paint a Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inet that was within the lodgings, which ſhe had given me, to the end ſhe might at leaſtwiſe render my priſon the more agreeable, as ſhe ſayd. She demanded of him if he would undertake it; and he, more contented than I am able to tell you, expreſſed a mighty deſire to be at her ſervice; ſo that the matter being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on, and the Princeſs having commanded him to ſee the Cabinet, and to think of contriving the deſign thereof, ſhe appointed him to be lodged with <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> holding it an injuſtice to ſeparate two ſuch fair ſiſters, as Muſick and Painting; and ſo did ſhe lodge the two Rivals together, that is to ſay, two Enemies, without her knowing of it, and without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it alſo. For if <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was become amorous at the firſt ſight of the Princeſs, the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> was charmed with it. I very well perceived, as well as <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> how He beheld her with an extraordinary attention; but I marvailed yet leſs at that than at the other, imagining that as he was a Painter, ſo being well ſeen in beauties, he would conſerve ſome Idea of that of the Princeſs, to make uſe thereof in his Pictures. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and he complemented very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one with another, and were as great friends at firſt, as they were foes afterwards. They thought in the mean while, each of them in particular, of the deſign they had in hand, and dextrouſly informing themſelves of the Princeſſes mind, they learnt how ſhe loved you ſtill, and that although the greateſt part of the World believed you to be dead, yet was ſhe abſolutely reſolved never to engage that faith unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſhe had given you: Whereupon they conceived it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for them to diſcover themſelves as yet to the Princeſs; but contrarily, that it would be the means of ruining all their deſigns, and depriving them of her ſight for ever. Wherefore they reſolved to continue with her as long as they could; carefully to obſerve her diſpoſition; to pleaſe her as much as poſſibly they could; and to work according to occaſion. For afterwards we underſtood both all their deſigns, and all their reaſonings, which in this encounter were almoſt the very ſame. Behold them then in the determination to render themſelves agreeable to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and to me alſo, becauſe they perceived that I was gracious with her. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> taught me Muſick with a great deal of care, and concealed none of the ſecrets of his Art from me; yet ſometimes he was vext for that I learned ſo faſt; for, ſaid he to himſelf, as we underſtood afterwards, as ſoon as ſhe knows as much as I knovv, I ſhall be diſcharged; and if I doe not teach her as I ſhould, they will turn me away. Howſoever he made choice of the firſt, and indeed was one of the beſt Maſters in the World. The Painter on the other ſide drew out the deſigns of his Pictures, where I think he put all the diſguiſements of <hi>Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury,</hi> and of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods of the Fiction. But the beſt was, that what he did to continue the longer at <hi>Monaco,</hi> had like to have driven him from thence; for fearing leſt he ſhould be diſcarded when the painting of this Cabinet came once to be finiſhed, he wrought ſo ſlowly, as one might ſay it was <hi>Penelopes</hi> Web, and how he undid that in the night which he had done in the day. Nevertheleſs, wheras the little which he did was very excellent, the Princeſs would not follow the coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ell that my impatience gave hee about it. Now if the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> intimated love to the Princeſs by his Pictures, the Muſician did no leſs by his Songs; for with equivocating words he told her what he was, and what he thought. But ſhe had her mind ſo eloigned from ſuch like things, as ſhe made no application, either of the one, or of the other of them to her ſelf. In the mean time, theſe two Rivals becomming every day more and more amorous, and the Princeſs always expreſſing a great deal of goodneſs towards them, they beleeved, each of them in his particular, that ſhe eſteemed them enough to pardon a violence when as they ſhould execute it; though not enough to receive the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> favourably when as ſhe might refuſe them: ſo that carryed with ſome hope, and a great deal of deſpair all at once, the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> by the means of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60144:90"/> Maſter of his Horſe, who came into the Town in the habit of a Fiſher-man, to know if he wanted any thing, gave order to have a veſſell of War brought near to <hi>Monaco,</hi> for the deſign which he premeditated: And <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who knew well enough that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do not diſapprove of thoſe who augment their dominion by any way whatſoever, ſent a Gentleman, whom he had dravvn diſguiſed into the town, to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tch him mony, and ſome troops of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> by the permiſſion of the Marquis of <hi>Guaſt,</hi> to whom he wrote about it, for the executing of that which he thought on. During theſe preparations, the Painter and the Muſician continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their endeavours ſtill about the Princeſs; the one always made myſterious Pictures, and the other always ſung Songs, wherein he ſpake of love without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood, ſo that they came to be ſomewhat ſuſpitious one of another; and that which began to make them ſo, was, for that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> not ſeeing the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs enough to content the extreme paſſion wherein he was for her, had intreated the Painter in private to draw her picture for him, and let no body know of it. The manner of <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> making this propoſition begot ſome ſuſpition in the Prince of <hi>Salerno;</hi> and the manner alſo of his excuſing himſelf from embracing it, made <hi>Don Fernando</hi> obſerve him with the more care; ſo that paſſing over again in their memory how they had lived together before, they found wherewith to augment their ſuſpitions, but not wherewith to doubt of that which they thought. After this they never lived wel together; they traduced one anothers profeſſion; the Painter ſaid that he had heard better ſinging at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the other affirmed that all the deſigns of the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> Pictures were ſtoln from antient Painters. One day as they were in the Princeſſes chamber, they entred into a diſpute before her, and by that liberty forgot the perſonage which they repreſented; yet was not ſhe offended at it, but contrarily took pleaſure in hearing them. The Painter would have his Art car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it from Muſick; he ſayd that it was the imitator of Nature; he vaunted that he could beguile the eyes, and deceive reaſon by the illuſions of perſpective; he ſayd moreover, that it was Painting which made men live after their death; that it was ſhe which erected Tropheis for the victorious; that by her we ſee battels which we had not ſeen; that by her we know <hi>Alexander</hi> and all the <hi>Heroes</hi> of Antiquity; that by her we make voyages without ſtirring out of our Cabinets; that by her we ſee our friends though they be abſent; that ſhe was a viſible Hiſtory, a mute Poeſie; and to ſay all, that ſhe was ſo excellent, as a good Painter might almoſt boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the creator of the things which he repreſents. The Muſician, who would not give place to the Painter, maintained, that there was the ſame difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Painting and Muſick, as between the body and the ſoul; that this firſt was wholly materiall and groſs in compariſon of the other, which was altogether ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; that if Painting erected Tropheis to the victorious, Muſick ſung their victoryes; that the one touched nought but the eys, whereas the other, all celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and divine, wrought upon the very ſoul with ſo much power, as ſhe excited or appeaſed the paſſions as ſhe pleaſed; and by this ſweet tyranny rendred her ſelf abſolute miſtris of all reaſonable perſons. He ſayd farther, that to judge rightly of the advantage which ſhe had over Painting, we were but to conſider, that the beſt illuſions ſhe can make, do alwaies work a greater effect upon the rude vulgar than on worthy people; that indeed ſhe might ſtrike theſe with admiration, but never utterly deceive them, ſo that ſhe operates more powerfully upon the ignorant than on the able. He added, that it was not ſo with Muſick, which did not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate abſolutely but over reaſonable perſon: that to have wit is not enough for us to become her ſubjects, and be charmed by her; but we muſt alſo have, not only ſome knowledge of this Art, but likewiſe a great and noble ſoul; ſo that quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Painting, the more able we are, the more we ſuffer our ſelves to be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her charms: That the other was but a deceiver, which pays us with nothing but apparences, and ſo impotent, that ſhe can do nothing of her ſelf, or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſhe is nothing without the help of cloth, pencils, and colours; That the beauties of Muſick were effective beauties, and to ſhew her independency we are but to conſider, that ſhe is no other than a pure effect of the imagination, guided by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60144:90"/> judgement; ſo that having no need of forraign things, it is not hard to judge, what advantage ſhe hath over Painting. It is certain, that the diſpute of theſe two men ſeemed too tranſcendent to me for perſons of their profeſſion, and I began to look on the Princeſs in a manner, which teſtifyed unto her how much I was amazed thereat, when as <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> perceiving it, took preſently upon him the humor, which is ordinarily attributed to Muſicians; and with a caprichiouſneſs, wherein no feigning appeared, he gave an hundred geering quipps to the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who played his part as well as the other; ſo that returning out of the amazement which I had been in, I reflected no further upon it, but heard the reſt of their diſpute with great delight; for they made ſo pleaſant a Satyre againſt each others profeſſion, as the Princeſs herſelf, ſpight of her melancoholy, could not forbear laughing. Howbeit ſhe would have them become friends before they departed; and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Painter, exceedingly ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe, knew not what to think thereof; when as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> proſecuting it, gave them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how that which made him ſo averſe unto him, was the thought he had, that when he ſhould be gone from <hi>Monaco,</hi> the Princeſs could not chuſe but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, becauſe ſhe ſhould alwaies ſee his Pictures, whereas if it were his ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to depart from thence, ſhe would preſently forget him, nothing remaining of him that might make him be remembred of her. If this jealouſie did not ſhew as much malice as affection, replyed the Painter, I ſhould fear the Princeſs might take it well at your hands, but as I believe her to be very equitable, ſo I think ſhe will find the coldneſs which is betwixt us better grounded, when as I ſhall tell her, that our diſſenſion proceeds from our not knowing one another. Or it may be, ſaid <hi>Don Fernando</hi> interrupting him, from our knowing one another too well. Never a whit replyed the Painter, for you are as unskilfull in painting, as I am in muſick, and ſo we are but bad judges of each other; and it is the Princeſs alone, which will one day put a difference between us, when as ſhe ſhall know me b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Princeſs, who thought he ſpake of the deſignes of his Pictures, told him, that ſhe knew him enough already to admire all that he did. And whereas <hi>Don Fernando</hi> would have replyed, ſhe forbad him, and commanded them both to live better together afterwards, than they had done. They anſwered, that they would obey her as much as they could, and ſo retyred with a great deal of unquietneſs. The Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> found <hi>Don Fernando</hi> too ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and ſuiting too much with the Princeſs, for to be ſung without deſign. In fine, he thought, that as he was capable of diſguiſing himſelf like a Painter, ſo might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother be of diſguiſing himſelf like a Muſician. Nevertheleſs this likely ſuſpition continued not long with him; and conſidering how much men of this profeſſion are careſſed by great perſons, he no longer mervailed at his boldneſs; he found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that his obſervations upon his ſongs were ridiculous; for, ſaid he, as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſince, upon what ſubject would I have them made, that they ſhould not ſuit with the Princeſs? All ſongs for the moſt part are of love, they ſpeak of beauty, of diſpair, of reſpect, of fear, of Jealouſie; they ſay that they dare not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves; that love would have them, and that reſpect will not ſuffer them to do ſo: And whereas few ſongs are made upon giving of thanks, I am not to wonder if <hi>Don Fernando</hi> ſings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whilſt the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> deceived himſelf in this ſort, the Muſician reaſoned with himſelf about that which had paſſed between them; but that which he ſtood moſt upon, was his obſervation, that in all the deſignes which this Painter had drawen at <hi>Monaco,</hi> there was alwaies ſome diſguiſement in them. Howbeit he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſtroyed his own reaſonings, as well as the Prince of <hi>Salerno;</hi> and coming to conſider, that Fiction is one of the greateſt ſciences of Painters, he changed his op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And that which prevailed yet more with him, vvas to ſee him, whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60144:91"/> many times as his Rivall, paint ſo excellently; for he could not imagine that a man of quality could underſtand this Art ſo perfectly. Theſe divers thoughts were never for all that ſo vvell ſetled in their minds, but that they paſt often from the one to the other, and ſo were alwaies ready to quarrell one with another. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the intereſt of their Nations was the occaſion of their diſputes; and if the Princeſs authority, joyned to the fear which they had of venturing themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, and deſtroying their deſignes, had not kept them from it, they had without doubt fought more than once. In the mean time the Princeſs and I lived without ſuſpecting any thing of the truth; Howbeit I remember, that one day it came into my thought, that there was ſomething extraordinary in <hi>Don Fernando;</hi> for teaching me an ayr which I found to be extremely paſſionate, and of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, I demanded of him laughing, whether it were poſſible for him to ſpeak ſo of love, without being in love. He anſwered me thereunto, that he could not, for that it was impoſſible for him to ſpeak againſt his heart. But, ſaid I unto him, may not I be your confident, and may not I know the perſon for whom you make ſuch excellent things? You would no ſooner be my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, anſwered he, but you would be mine enemy, wherefore I will not tell you any thing, nor ſhall you know it but when I can no longer conceal it. I confeſs my ſimplicity unto you, for my firſt apprehenſion being over, I believed that I had ſome ſhare in this diſcourſe; and fearing I ſhould be obliged to intreat the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to turn <hi>Don Fernando</hi> away, if he came to loſe the reſpect which he owed me, I preſſed him no further, contenting my ſelf with being his ſcholer, and not his confident. And I was ſo affraid to part with him, as I never ſpake of this matter to the Princeſs, who paſt a good part of her time in ſeeing the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> paint.</p>
                  <p>In the mean ſpace theſe two diſguiſed Lovers finding no reaſon for them to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, were even in diſpair with it. They ſaw the Princeſs every day more firm in the reſolution ſhe had taken; for whereas they were dextrous and intereſſed, they had ſo gained ſome of the Princeſſes Officers, as by them they knew all that did paſs, and all that had paſt. I have told you already, that the Princeſs imployed a good part of the day in ſeeing him paint, this entertainment agreeing better with her melancholy, than Muſick; It was then impoſſible, but that, being good as ſhe is, the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> ſhould often have occaſion to talk with her; and in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, ſhe had found ſo much ſpirit and civility in him, as one day ſhe preſſed him to let her know where he had led his life. And whereas he had taken a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you ſhall underſtand by and by, he anſwered her, that he had never had any other Maſter but the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who was one of the moſt conſiderable, both for his birth and riches, that was in all the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> that it had been in his late fathers houſe where he had learn'd to know the faſhions of the world better, than ordinarily Painters do; and that not long before, through a miſchance, which he could not avoid, he was come away from the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> ſervice; But, Madam, continued he, though I be from him, I cannot chuſe but ſay, that his inclinations are great; that he loves glory and vertue, for touching his wit, it is not for me to judge of it. I mervail, ſaid the Princeſs unto him, if he be ſuch as you ſay, that you would leave him; for being great in birth, mighty in riches, and ſo vertuous as you paint him forth to be, he muſt alſo without doubt be liberall, ſo that I do not ſee any reaſon for your abandoning him. That is it, Madam, anſwered he, wherein I can not ſatisfie you; howſoever I can aſſure you, that next to you, there is no body in the world whom I would ſerve with more affection. It was in this ſort that the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> began to give good impreſſions of himſelf to the Princeſs, that he might prepare her the better to his deſire; and divers times the Princeſs and he had ſuch like converſations. At length that Maſter of his horſe, whom he had ſent to <hi>Naples,</hi> returned unto the Town diſguiſed as he uſed to be, and acquainted him, that he had left at <hi>Villa-franco,</hi> which as you know is near hereunto, a veſſell throughly furniſhed with all things, and an hundred well reſolved and affectionate ſoldiers in her. The Prince told him, that he would have him come
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60144:91"/> and preſent himſelf the next day at <hi>Monaco;</hi> and giving him a letter for the Princeſs, and another for his Governor, who was come thither whither he would or no, he gave him an expreſs charge not to make any ſhew of knowing him, if ſo be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould happen to be admitted into the Town. He ſent him away then throughly inſtructed in all that he had to do. The day following, the veſſell belonging to the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> (who that day found out the meanes to be near the Princeſs) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf for to enter into the port; but according to order, a barque having been ſent unto it, and having underſtood what this veſſell was, the Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſs was preſently advertiſed thereof, who continuing in her reſolution, commanded, that the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> meſſenger and his train onely ſhould be admitted, and that withall they ſhould come into the port in the ſame barque which had been ſent forth to diſcover them. The buſineſs was executed as ſhe had commanded it; the Painter, the Muſician, and my ſelf, were at that time with her; and vvhereas ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that this Painter had told her, how he had belonged to the Prince of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerno:</hi> You ſhall ſee now, ſaid ſhe unto him, that your old Maſter will draw you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from my ſervice; if it ſhould be ſo, continued ſhe, what anſwer will you have me make? That I will dy rather than abandon you, replyed he: But I do not think it is his deſign, and knowing him as I do he will rather increaſe the number of your ſervants, than rob you any. As he ſaid thus, his people arrived, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making ſhow of knowing him, ſaluted the Princeſs with a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> old Governor delivered her a letter written to her from his Maſter; ſhe read it with bluſhing, and though I perceived a great deal of unquietneſs in the Painters face, yet was I perſwaded that only the intereſt which he ſeemed to have in the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> or the fear he was in leſt he ſhould be forced to quit the Princeſſes ſervice, was the cauſe of it. After the reading of this letter I knew by her diſcourſe that it was a propoſition of mariage, and a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love. She ſaid to the Princes Meſſenger, that his Maſter did her an honor which ſhe was unworthy of. And whereas this Governor would have inlarged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This gallanterie gave great hope to the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and filled the mind of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. In the mean time the Princeſs told the Princes Meſſenger, that he ſhould have her anſwer the next day, and then commanded her Officers to have a care of him, and to conduct him to the lodgings where ſtrangers were entertained. They were no ſooner gone, but the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> making uſe of the liberty which the Princeſſes goodneſs gave to all her ſervants when ſhe was in private. I rightly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavv, Madam, ſaid he unto her, that the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> would not make me change my Miſtreſs. For my part, ſaid <hi>Don Fernando</hi> interrupting him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his ſpeech to the Princeſs, with an intention to uſe a trick for the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> deſignes (whom he did not imagine was ſo near him) I think I ſhould betray my duty, and be wanting to the fidelity which I owe you, if ſeeing your happineſs, or unhappineſs concerned, I ſhould not tell you, that this Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> is nothing leſs than what you are told he is. Do you know him, demanded the Painter of him with a great deal of coldneſs? I have ſeen him an hundred times, replyed he, during three months ſpace that I was at <hi>Naples;</hi> he would have had me live with him, after I had taught him ſome Spaniſh Aires, but having been acquainted with the fantaſticallneſs of his humor, I would not ſerve him. Beſides, Madam, this Prince is neither rich, nor powerfull in his Country, in ſuch manner as one would make you believe; and I wonder how he ſhould be ſo hardy, as to extend his ambition ſo far as to you. Permit me, Madam, ſaid the Painter interrupting him, to clear my ſelf of the doubt wherein I am, and to ask of this enemy to the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> whether he be young, or old, and in what place they grew acquainted together? for as he talkes, I dare ſay he knows him him not. He is young, anſwered <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and that you may not think but that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60144:92"/> I knovv him, I aſſure you that I found him the firſt time I ſavv him at <hi>Naples</hi> to have but a bad aſpect, and to be very uncomely in his behavior. The ſuſpition vvhich I have vvill not end ſo ſoon, replyed the Painter, for if I had undertaken it, I could let her excellency ſee, that he is not ſo unhandſom as you vvould make him to be. The Princeſs, vvho had no intereſt in this diſpute, nor apprehended that vvhich the Painter ſaid, as he meant it, interrupted him, for to demand vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could dravv the picture of a perſon that vvas abſent, and make it like him? Never doubt of it, Madam, ſaid he unto her. If you dravv that of the Prince of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerno,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> I am ſure it vvill not reſemble you, for indeed he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo handſom. You do me too much honor, anſvvered the Painter coldly; but to dravv me out of the doubt vvherein I am, tell me, vvho hath informed you that the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> is ſo fantaſticall? All his ſervants, replyed the other, vvho complained exceedingly of it. I vvonder at that, ſaid the Painter; but vvho hath told you too, that he vvas not rich? All the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> anſvvered the other, vvho are vvell acquainted vvith the diſorders of his Houſe; and then again I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it vvell enough my ſelf, for he gave me nothing for the paines I took in teaching him to ſing. It is not his cuſtom to be ſo ſparing, anſvvered the Painter; But tell me yet, who ſerved him at that time? This old Governor which you ſaw but now, was he with him? What were his recreations? what was his delight? what was his imployment? I think I did not ſee that man about him, anſwered <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> and for his Maſter, I found him ſo little worthy of eſteem, that I did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him; howſoever I am very ſure that he is not conſiderable at all, either in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> or with the <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi> I ſee no likelyhoood, replyed the Painter, for one to believe that the Emperor and the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> have entertained you with theſe matters, whilſt you were playing on the Violl. There is yet leſs, ſaid the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, that they ſhould tell you the contrary of that which I affirm, whilſt you were beſmearing of walls. Ah! Madam, ſaid the Painter interrupting him, permit me to puniſh the lying and malice of this impoſtor, who dares traduce a man ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, whom certainly he does not know, and a Prince too, who cannot be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without merit, ſince he is capable of the deſign to ſerve you; He hath been my Maſter, and is now your ſervant, pardon me then if for your ſake I loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is due unto you. Do not you fear, ſaid the Princeſs unto him, that <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> ſpeeches ſhall ever hurt the Prince of <hi>Salerno;</hi> neither doubt you, that this noble ardor which you ſhow in maintaining his party ſhall diſpleaſe me, but contrarily I ſhall eſteem of you the more for it; and I forbid <hi>Don Fernando</hi> from ever ſpeaking of that Prince but with reſpect; but withall I charge you not to remember what he hath ſaid, and command both of you once more to live lovingly together. The Painter wholly filled with hope, rendred thanks to the Princeſs; and the Muſician not able to doe othervviſe, got him avvay aſſoon as the Princeſs vvas entred into her Cabinet, vvith a purpoſe to anſvver the letter vvhich ſhe had received from the Prince of <hi>Salerno:</hi> Who being vvithdravvn in private, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> boldneſs in maintaining of a lie, and on all that had paſt betvvixt them, he no longer doubted but that he vvas a man of quality, vvhom, the ſame reaſon vvhich had made him a Painter, had made a Muſician. Coming then to look on <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> as on his Rivall, he had an hundred times a mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf unto him, that he might oblige him to fight vvith him; but this firſt ſenſe of revenge and jealouſie being over, he knevv it would ruine his deſign; For He conſidered, that if the Princeſs anſvver to him vvas favourable, he ſhould have time enough to be revenged; and if it vvere not, that then he ſhould diſcover himſelf to ill purpoſe, and deprive himſelf of the means of executing that vvhich he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated; he reſolved then to make a ſhevv, in caſe the Princeſs anſvver'd rigorouſly, of having forgotten vvhat had paſt, vvith an intent to live very civilly vvith <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> to the end that converſing often vvith him, and obſerving al his actions, he might not be prevented by him, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> on his ſide believed, after he had vvell thought upon it, that this Painter had been ſent by the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> to ſpeak well of him to the Princeſs before he declared himſelf, knowing well enough that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60144:92"/> ſhe permitted not the entrance of any perſon of quality into <hi>Monaco;</hi> and in this thought he purpoſed likewiſe to obſerve him very carefully. In the mean time, the Princeſs ſent the next morning for the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> meſſenger to receive his anſwer, where the Painter, and the Muſician were alſo preſent, having thruſt themſelves amongſt thoſe which conducted this Meſſenger to her. The Princeſs, in giving him her letter, prayed him to aſſure his Maſter, that ſhe ſhould be eternally obliged to him for the honor he had done her; that ſhe beſought him to believe, that though ſhe did not grant him that which he deſired of her, yet could it not be tearmed a refuſall, ſince ſhe refuſed him nothing but what ſhe could not grant him; that ſhe owed that reſpect to the aſhes of her father, as not to violate that faith which ſhe had given by his commandment; and that being thus no longer her own, he was not to take it ill, if ſhe aſſured him that ſhe could never be his; that nothing reſting in her power, but the eſteem of him and his friendſhip, ſhe aſſured him both of the one and the other, and of an acknowledgement that ſhould laſt as long as her life. This obliging refuſall aſſwaged not the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> grief, who himſelf heard his own ſentence pronounced; nevertheleſs he had reaſon enough left to uſe his uttermoſt indeavour to conceal it, for fear he ſhould be ſuſpected of the Princeſs. As for <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> the joy which he teſtified for this adventure was ſo great, as the Painter was the more confirmed in the opinion which he had. After the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> Meſſenger was gone, &amp; that the Princeſs had given him a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond of great value, and that ſhe had commanded him to be conducted to the Barque, vvhich vvas to carry him back to his Veſſell, the Painter craved leave of he, that he might accompany him vvith the reſt, for he durſt not ſpeak to him, ſaid he, unleſs it pleaſed her to permit him. You are diſcreet, ſaid the Princeſs, and this reſpect merits more than this which you demand of me. The Painter having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this permiſſion, went and overtook his Governor, to ſalute hm; this man, who was inſtructed as he ought, uſed him like a Painter, and dexterouſly giving him the commodity to talk with him, this Prince willed him to return unto <hi>Villa-Franco,</hi> under pretext of mending ſomething about his veſſell, and to ſend the Maſter of his Horſe the next morning diſguiſed unto him, with as much money as as he could bring. Now you are to underſtand, that the day before he hapned to meet and know an old Souldier, which ſometime had born armes under his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whoſe life he had ſaved, being at that time Sergeant of one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Garriſon. The Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> comeing to know him, found the meanes to ſpeak with him in private, and after he had given him three hundred piſtolets, he made himſelf known unto him. This man raviſhed to ſee the Son of his old Maſter, but more yet with his liberality, teſtified after his manner, both his acknowledgement, and his joy. In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who had not made himſelf known unto him only to inrich him, told him how he was to ſerve him in a buſines that concern'd all his happines. This man told him, that he was his ſubject, and his obligee, ſo that conſequently he might expect any thing from him. Then the Prince asked him, whether he lived alone in his houſe, and having learn: that he did, he asked of him further, whether he could not ſuborn a Fiſher-man with mony; this Souldier having anſwered him, that the poverty of thoſe kind of people did not permit him to doubt but that he ſhould find out an hundred in ſtead of one, he gave him wherewithall to gain him, without diſcovering any par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of his deſign unto him, aſſuring him only that this Fiſher-man ſhould be expoſed to no perill, nor have ought els to do, than to carry his nets: That which made the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> do thus, was, for that he had obſerved how juſt at ten of the clock in the forenoon the ordinary Guard ſtill uſed to riſe, and thereby had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they which ſaw a Fiſher-man go forth laden with his nets about nine, would not be there at five in the evening, and ſo conſequently he might come in again accompanied with two men attired like Fiſhermen, and laden with nets a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he was, without any notice taken of them. After he had reaſoned thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he reſolved to execute that which he had premeditated long before, judging rightly by the anſwer which the Princeſs had given his Meſſenger, that nothing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60144:93"/> but violence could put him in poſſeſſion of her. This deſign being abſolutely concluded, he ſought for the means to execute it. This Sergeant brought him a Fiſher-man into a place apart, whom he inſtructed with that which he would have him to do; and the next day this man went out of the Town about eight of the clock in the morning laden with nets, and (as I have already ſaid) before the Guard was riſen; but when it was towards evening, he gave over fiſhing, and went to meet with two Souldiers diſguiſed like Fiſhermen, who came by Land from the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi>'s Veſſell, which was at <hi>Villa-Franco,</hi> and waited for him at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rendezvouz which had been appointed him: Having ſhared his nets amongſt them, he re-entred into the Town, and incountring none of thoſe ſouldiers at the Gate which had ſeen him in the morning, no notice was taken of them, and ſo they went along with him home; where they ſtayed till it was night, and then theſe two men having left their nets there, were conducted by him to the Sergeants houſe, in which they abode concealed untill the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> had need of them. By this device there entred every day two ſouldiers into the Town, who carryed two Piſtolls and two ſhort ſwords hidden in the nets, wherevvith they were laden. But whereas there vvas to be thirty days before the threeſcore ſouldiers, vvhich he had deſtined for his enterprize, could enter, he vvas in an extreme impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; hovvbeit he concealed it ſo vvell, as vve could never perceive it. In the mean time he had gotten him a ladder of cords, vvherevvith he purpoſed to bring a dozen ſouldiers into the Caſtle thorough the vvindovvs of his chamber, vvhich o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon a place vvhere no body uſually paſſed, and where no body could trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his deſign; for upon the diſorder which had been between him and the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, they had been lodged aſſunder. For the reſt of his Souldiers, he had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſend them under the conduct of the Maſter of his houſe, and that Sergeant, to the gate of the Town, for to render themſelves Maſters of it, whilſt he ſhould carry the Princeſs away by force, for which effect his Veſſell was to be at the Port. But whilſt he attended for the entrance of all his ſouldiers, and that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> alſo attended the return of him from whom he hoped for ſuccour in his enterprize, they lived better together than ever they had done, and in ſhow they loved one another extremely, though indeed they hated and obſerved one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as two enemies. As for <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> he had (during the deſign which he kept cloſe) fallen into a ſtrict league of friendſhip with one of the principall Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Monaco,</hi> whom the Princeſs had made Captain of the Gate. His firſt admittance into this mans houſe, was to teach his only daughter to ſing, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his converſation grew ſo pleaſing unto him, as he frequented thither very often, and ſo they came to love one another exceedingly. <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> in the thought which he was in, turned his eyes upon this Captain, and having heard him ſay divers times, that the people began to murmur againſt the Princeſs, for that it ſeemed ſhe had reſolved all her life-time to make a deſert of <hi>Monaco,</hi> and utterly to ruine the trade thereof, by the difficulty which there was of entring into it, he reſolved to confide in him, as he hid, after he had blinded him firſt with a great ſum of money, which he gave him. And that which made him not doubt but that the Gentleman, whom he had ſent, would bring him Troopes, was, becauſe he knew the Armies of <hi>Spain</hi> were very powerfull in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that if he could once render himſelf Maſter of this place, ſhe ſhould not only be juſtified, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuccoured; the Councell of <hi>Spain</hi> never wanting pretexts to invade the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Neighbors, when as they find occaſion for it. During this expectation, the Princeſs had had her unqu etneſs, as well as her Lovers; for that Lieutenant of her Guard, whom ſhe had ſent to ſeek you, ſeemed too long to her in returning: and whereas ſhe had made it a ſecret, I was ſhe alone to whom ſhe complayned of it; Nevertheleſs one of her women chancing upon a day to overhear ſomewhat confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly what ſhe ſaid unto me, believed that you were ſuddenly to return, and her joy was ſo great for it, as ſhe told this falſe newes to all the Princes Officers, who quickly acquainted the Painter and Muſician with it, never dreaming that they would be otherwiſe concerned in it than to rejoyce at it as they cid. Howbeit this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60144:93"/> newes wrought an other effect, for thereupon both the one and the other of them haſtened the finiſhing of the deſignes they had in hand. They wondred notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſee that that which it ſeemed ſhould have made the Princeſs glad, ſhould render her ſo melancholy as ſhe would ſcarce ſee the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> paint any more, nor hear <hi>Don Fernando</hi> ſing any longer: But I found a meanes to make her change her reſolution; for calling to mind two ſongs, which you had made for the Princeſs, I got <hi>Don Fernando</hi> to learn them; and that he might take more care in ſinging of them, I told him whoſe they were, and for whom they were made, for fear his negligence ſhould cauſe the Princeſs to hate him. I marked well that he bluſhed when I propounded this unto him; but whereas I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been ingenious in finding out reaſons to deceive my ſelf, I was yet more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n this occaſion; and I believed that onely the ſpight of being obliged to ſing the Airs which he himſelf had not made, was the cauſe of his choler, and in this error I continued even unto the end. For when he had learned theſe Aires, after they had been repeated unto him above twenty times, yet did he not ſing them very well: Nevertheleſs the Princeſs would hear no other thing, howſoever I intreated her to the contrary; ſo that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was thereby reduced to that point, as he could not ſee the Princeſs unleſs he would ſing his Rivalls ſongs: Which he did with ſo much conſtraint, as he made me to laugh at him; For ſtill I was perſwaded that he did it out of caprichiouſneſs and pride, though indeed it was out of jealouſie. As for the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> another adventure befell him. When as there lacked but two dayes of the time wherein all his Souldiers were to come in, the Princeſs remembred how ſhe had heard him ſay, that he could draw the picture of one that was abſent, that ſhould be like him, and thereupon believed that by the inſtructions which ſhe could give him he might peradventure draw a picture that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble you, though he had never ſeen you. She propoundes the matter unto him, aſſures him that he ſhall infinitely oblige her if he can do it; and though ſhe told him not preciſely who the perſon was that ſhe deſired the picture of, yet he knew that undoubtedly it was yours which ſhe would have. At firſt he ſaid, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved he could not do it; but after he had thought on it a little, I will endeavour, Madam, ſaid he unto her laughing, to content you, provided you will have the goodneſs not to intreat me as an ordinary Painter, and that you will acknowledge unto me, after you have ſeen it, that it is the picture of the man, who of all the world honors you with moſt reſpect, and loves you with moſt paſſion. You know too much for a Painter, ſaid the Princeſs unto him bluſhing, howſoever I vvill pardon you this boldneſs, and vvill acknovvledge that unto you vvhich you ſay, provided you preſently go in hand vvith your vvork. The Painter having for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver made a love obeiſance, vvent to fetch a cloth and colours for him to vvork in her chamber. When he vvas arrived there the Princeſs vvould have had a great glaſs taken avvay, vvhich hung right oppoſite to the place vvhere he had ſeated himſelf, for fear the Sun vvhich gave full upon it, ſhould mar it; But he prayed her that it might not be removed, becauſe as he ſaid, it ſerved to eaſe his ſight. The Princeſs then began to deſcribe you as you are, and particulariſing unto him all the features of your face as vvell as poſſibly ſhe could, ſhe thought ſhe had inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſufficiently. Whereupon he began to deſign this picture, and pauſing at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry draught that he made, as it vvere to recollect his memory, at length he traced our all the reſt. And after the Princeſs had cauſed him to alter ſomething, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that it vvas very near to the ſame vvhich ſhe deſired; but for fear he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ten vvhat ſhe had already told him, ſhe repreſented unto him again the colour of your hair, of your eyes, and of your complexion. Then he took his palet, and his pencills, and tricked the picture, vvhich certainly reſembled you a little, but leſs than vvhen it vvas only traced out vvith the cole. The Princeſs mervelled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; and knevv not vvhereunto ſhe might attribute the cauſe of it; for conſidering every feature in particular, ſhe ſavv that little lacked but they vvere juſt as ſhe had figured them, and yet for all that the vvhole put together ſcarce reſembled you at all. But the Painter nothing abaſhed at it, told her that it vvas but a tricking, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60144:94"/> paſt his vvord unto her, that the firſt time he ſhould touch it he vvould bring it to that paſs, as it vvould be impoſſible for her not to knovv in this picture the moſt faithfull of her Lovers. The day following the Painter came again into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes chamber by her order, and ſeated himſelf in the ſame place vvhere he ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Princeſs inſtructed him again, and he making ſhovv of hearkning very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively unto her, beheld himſelf in that glaſs vvhich hung before him; but the more he vvrought, the leſs did this picture reſemble you, though ſhe could not vvell ſay vvhere the fault of it vvas. She made him touch the eyes again, alter ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the mouth, and ſo of all the other features; and though he ſeemed exactly to obey her, yet kept he ſtill from the Princeſs deſign. And this ſhadow of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> which appeared in this picture was defaced at every ſtroak that he gave, although he ſeemed to uſe his uttermoſt indeavour carefully to follow the Princes directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And when ſhe teſtifyed to the Painter the unquietneſs ſhe was in for it, he told her, that to judge well of a picture, one was not to look upon it whilſt it was a doing, and to diſcern the faults the better of that which he was about, ſhe was to let him work an hower upon it without looking on him. The Princeſs believed him, and taking me away with her to the other end of the chamber, we left him alone; but we were much amazed, when he had advertiſed us that his work was done, and that he had brought it into the light for us to judge the better of it, to ſee that it was his own picture which he had drawen, and not yours. The Princeſs then perceived plainly, that this was not a matter of chance, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant calling to mind ſo many things, as ſhe had ſeen without thinking of them, ſhe made no doubt but that there was ſomewhat, which was myſterious enough in this adventure; Yet had ſhe ſufficient conſtancy of mind not to ſhew all her amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to take from the Painter the meanes of diſcovering himſelf further; I well foreſaw, ſaid ſhe unto him with a ſeeming ſimplicity, that this glaſs would make you ſpoyl your work; And I am very ſorry, continued ſhe, going towards her Cabinet, that you have loſt your time, and I too. If this picture, ſaid the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> in following her two or three ſteps, does not reſemble the moſt paſſionate of your Lovers, I with all my heart renounce the profeſſion which I make. Take heed, anſwerd the Princeſs, that my anger becomes not as ſtrong, as your preſumption is great. Madam, ſaid he unto her, retayning her by the Gown, I am not ſo faulty as I ſeem to be, and to juſtifie my ſelf in ſome ſort to you, I muſt tell you, that I have no other deſign in drawing this picture, than to let you ſee that the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> is not ſo ugly as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> hath deſcribed him unto you; For by a ſtrange chance, I reſemble him ſo near, as I might well be taken for him: And that I may not conceal all the truth from you, continued he, I will confeſs to you, that it is by his conſent that I am here at <hi>Monaco,</hi> that it is to ſpeak to you of his affection, that thus I caſt my ſelf at your feet, moſt humbly intreating you to believe, that no man ever adored you with more reſpect. Anſwer then, Madam, I beſeech you, but not with fury, to the end that that faithfull Lover may ſhew himſelf to you. Under what form ſoever the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> may preſent himſelf, he ſhal alwaies receive the ſame entertainment from me; my reſolutions do not eaſily change; and ſhould he lay all the Crownes of the world at my feet, yet ſhould I refuſe him as now I do; But as for you, ſaid ſhe unto him, I ſhall know how to uſe you as you ought to be, and I am very much deceived if you talk to me long of loves. After this the Princeſs retyred without attending his anſwer. For my part, I profeſs unto you that I was ſo aſtoniſhed at this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I could not ſpeak. Howſoever I followed the Princeſs into her Cabinet, and reſpect obliged the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> to go out of her chamber, conceiving rightly by the manner wherewith he vvas anſvvered, that his perſwaſions would obtain nothing. That which made him carry himſelf thus, and to uſe this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous gallantery, was, that being upon the point of executing his deſign, he would have been glad to have found an occaſion to ſee, whether he could not by fair meanes have prevailed with the Princeſs, without having recourſe unto violence; and whereas his men were ready for the action, he feared not the hazarding of the matter; and then again the love which he bore to the Princeſs was ſo ſtrong,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60144:94"/> as he was reſolved to periſh, or poſſeſs her. In the mean time the Princeſs and I knew not what to think, nor what to reſolve; and ſhe demanding my advice about it, I knew not what to anſwer her. What think you of it, <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me? This Painter, hath he loſt his reſpect, or his reaſon? Is he an impoſtor, or a Prince? For my part, Madam, ſaid I unto her, I cannot tell what to ſay to you of it; he hath had patience enough for a Prince, in the abode that he hath made here, and in the diſputes which he hath had with <hi>Don Fernando;</hi> But it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged alſo that he hath too much wit, and too much boldneſs for a Painter. Whatſoever he is, ſaid the Princeſs, he ſhall not ſtay in <hi>Monaco.</hi> Madam, ſaid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, I am even of your mind, Prince or Painter, Lover or Enemy, it is fit he ſhould be gone; But if by chance he be the latter, it ſhould be done without ill-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him, for truly the loving you is no ſuch great crime: And if it be the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> he is more unhappy than faulty, and more worthy of your pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than of your indignation. I am of a contrary opinion, ſaid the Princeſs unto me, for if he be a Prince, I look upon him as a dreadfull enemy; But if he be a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Painter, he is unworthy of my anger, and his folly may beget compaſſion in me. We reaſoned in this manner all the evening, without being able to judge certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether this Painter were the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> or ſome one of his ſervants whom he had ſent to be about the Princeſs, howbeit we believed him to be rather the firſt than the other: And after we had examined the matter, it was reſolved that this Painter ſhould the next day be turned out of <hi>Monaco,</hi> without letting him know that he was ſuſpected to be a Prince, and alſo without any other ill uſage, than baniſhing him. With this intention the Princeſs went to bed, and would have me lye with her that night, it being impoſſible for her, as ſhe ſaid, to have any hope of ſleeping, as long as you ſhould have a Rivall in <hi>Monaco.</hi> Whilſt the Princeſs and I were agitating in this ſort, the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who had found that all his hope conſiſted wholly in force, reſolved to defer his deſign no longer, and to execute it the night enſuing; he went then to ſeek out that Sergeant with whom he held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and to ſpeak with the Maſter of his horſe, to the end his veſſell might not fail to be at the Port juſt at the hower which he had appointed, and that he ſhould deal in ſuch ſort, as all might be ready againſt need ſhould be. He gave them the time and the ſignall of the enterpriſe, and thinking that he had well diſpoſed of every thing, he retyred into the Caſtle as he uſed to do, taking but two piſtolls and a ſword along with him, which he caryed ſecretly into his chamber, in caſe any violence ſhould be offered him before his deſign could be executed. If the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> was buſied, no leſs was <hi>Don Fernando;</hi> For he had underſtood ſome dayes before, by the return of him whom he had ſent into the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his, and the Marquis of <hi>Guaſts</hi> directions, he had brought him ſtore of mony and jewells, together with five hundred men, which were come thither not in a body, but two and two in a company, and ſo were lodged in all the Villages about <hi>Monaco,</hi> with expreſs order to render themſelves all upon a certain night, whereof they ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ld be advertiſed, within a mile of the Town; So that <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> ſtayd for nothing but the return of the Captain of the Gate, who was gone to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and whoſe faith he had corrupted. This man, for our ill fortune, or to ſay better for our good fortune, came back as he deſired, ſo that the next morning, which was the very ſame day wherein this Painter finiſhed the picture that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled you ſo ill, he went and found him out, and having given him to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew of ten thouſand crownes in jewells, he confirmed him by this liberality in the deſign he had undertaken. But not to prolong my diſcourſe, it ſufficeth that I tell you, how after he had diſcovered himſelf to this man to be that he was a good while before; after he had perſwaded him, that the retiredneſs wherein the Princeſs lived, would in the end undo <hi>Monaco;</hi> becauſe, ſaid he, it was impoſſible, having no Prince to defend it, but that ſome one or other would ſeize upon it; after he had told him, that this place was too important, for to be left undefended under the Government of a mayd; and that ſeeing it was to paſs into the hands of ſtrangers, he was to deſire that it might fall into the power of a man, who would
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60144:95"/> be obliged to him for it, and that was able to make his fortune. After all theſe things, I ſay, this man charmed with the preſent benefit, with the hope of what was to come, and believing too that it would be ſomewhat advantagious for the Princeſs, he promiſed <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who communicated his whole deſign unto him, to deliver him the Gate whenſoever he pleaſed. Hereupon he ſent that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which belonged unto him, to carry his directions to all the ſeverall places where his ſouldiers were, to the end they ſhould preciſely meet together within a mile of <hi>Monaco</hi> an hour after midnight, and that they ſhould repair to the gate of the Town as ſoon as they could ſee a flaming Torch on a Tower. The ſtrangeneſs of this incounter was, that the very ſame night wherein the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> was to execute his deſign, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> reſolved, without knowing ought of his Rivalls affairs, no longer to defer his interprize, purpoſing to die, or to render himſelf Maſter of the Town, and poſſeſſor of the Princeſs: ſo that whilſt we were all the afternoon ſeeing the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> paint, he had been taking order for all things as well as the Captain of the Gate. Their deſigns being in theſe terms. You make me tremble with aſtoniſhment, ſaid <hi>Juſtinianio,</hi> interrupting <hi>Aemilia.</hi> You will have yet more, continued ſhe, when I ſhall tell you, that juſt about two hours after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, which by an extraordinary chance proved to be the very point, both of the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi>'s and <hi>Don Fernando</hi>'s enterprize; that firſt having cauſed twelve ſouldiers to enter thorough the window of his chamber with the help of a lader of cords, and commanded the Sergeant to go and ſeize upon the Gate of the town, that he might forcibly carry away the Princeſs in his Veſſell, which was to be at the Port at the ſame hour, we heard the outward chamber-door broke open; whereupon the Princeſs gave a great skrike, and vvithout ſtanding to knovv vvhat the matter ſhould be, the firſt thing that came into her thought vvas to put on her clothes, to the end ſhe might not be found in bed, vvherein I helped her vvith all the ſpeed that poſſibly I could. In the mean time her vvomen cryed out at the vvindovves, but the Princeſſes Officers lay in a quarter ſo far of, becauſe ſhe never feared any thing from the Tovvns ſide, and the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi>'s execution vvas ſo ſudden, as ſcarcely had the Princeſs gotten on a Night-govvn vvith much haſt, but he entred into her chamber followed by ten ſouldiers, having left two at the Caſtle-gate, who had ſtabbed the Porter upon his awaking. I leave you to think what the Princeſs became in this occaſion, when as maugre her reſiſtance and mine, maugre her tears, and maugre her cryes, ſhe ſaw her ſelf carryed away forcibly, by theſe ſouldiers, and led out of the Caſtle. I can indure no more, ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> with as much grief, and almoſt as much choler as if he had ſeen his Miſtreſs carryed away by force. Have patience, ſaid <hi>Aemilia,</hi> for yet you do not ſee all our Enemies. When as the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> had forcibly carryed away the Princeſs, I followed her all in tears, and catching faſt hold of one of the corners of her gown, we went in this ſort even to the Gate of the Town, neither the Princeſs nor I having the power to cry out, ſo much were we ſeized with fear, and our judgements troubled. The Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> found not the matter ſo eaſie as he had believed it; for the Sergeant, who had gotten the Ward, and that was to make uſe of it for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing of the Court of Guard, and cutting them in pieces, arrived juſt at the gate, as the Captain that ſerved <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> was delivering it up to his men, who were come thither under the conduct of the Gentleman which belonged unto him, after they had ſeen the Signall on the Tower. And whereas he had order to dye, or to render himſelf Maſter of it, what reſiſtance ſoever he met withall, he had already begun a ſharp and bloody ſight, when as the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and thoſe that kept the Princeſs, arrived at that place. And being a Prince of a great courage, after he had commanded his ten ſouldiers to look well to the Princeſs, he went with his ſword in his hand to ſee what the matter was. Never was there any thing more dreadfull than that ſame night; <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who lay not in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle that night, who was ready at the gate to receive in his men, and who was in the head of them, when as the Sergeant arrived there, thought he was diſcovered, and ſo did likewiſe the Captain of the gate; the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> incountring ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60144:95"/> great a number of Enemyes, could not tell what to imagine; and the darkneſs of the night augmenting this diſorder yet more, there was one of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts that hath been ſeen; for in this confuſion they killed on both ſides without knowing one another. In the mean time the alarum being taken up through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Town, and the bruit ſpread abroad that the Princeſs was forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly carried away, all the Troopes repaired to the place of armes, and all the people put themſelves into a poſture of ſuccouring us. And whereas it was eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on which ſide the Enemies were, the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> ſaw himſelf quickly incloſed both without and within; but firſt he came twice or thrice to the place where his Souldiers guarded us, to ſee in what eſtate the Princeſs was. And when he perceived by the abundance of people, which came running from all parts, that it would be impoſſible for him to finiſh his enterprize, he came o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will dye, Madam, ſaid he unto her, ſeeing I cannot poſſeſs you; But firſt know, for the rendring of my memory the leſs odious unto you, that after I have fought to carry you away, I goe now to fight for to keep you from being carryed away by <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to live for you, will dye at leaſtwiſe in defending you. This diſcourſe ſurpriſing the Princeſs; What ſaid ſhe, have we more Enemies than one? This while the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who notwithſtanding the darkneſs of the night, having obſerved that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was in the Head of the Troopes which he fought withall, called him ſo often by his name, that at length they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and entred ſo furiouſly into a particular combat, as loſing the care of their men, it was the eaſier for them of the Garriſon, and the people, who were all up in armes, to defeat them. The treacherous Captain laboured in vain to put <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> people into order; and the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> Maſter of his Horſe, and the Sergeant, whom he made uſe of, oppoſed themſelves a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſo in vain to the diſorder of theirs. The confuſion increaſed with the number; The Princeſſes Troopes augmented ſtill; thoſe of the Enemies diminiſhed every moment; And whereas her voyce was heard at laſt by ſome of her ſervants not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fearfull noiſe that was made, they which guarded us ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving marked it, and ſeeing above an hundred men come from divers parts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they abandoned us after ſome ſmall reſiſtance, and that they had ſhewed a great deal of care of not expoſing the Princeſs to any danger, as the Prince had expreſly charged them. They had no ſooner left us the liberty which they had taken from us, but the Princeſs, ſeeing herſelf in the hands of her own People, got into the neareſt houſe, and appointing Souldiers for the guard of it, ſhe commanded they ſhould ſend her word how things ſtood, and that if it were poſſible they ſhould not kill the two Heads of the Enemies forces. In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> Souldiers, which had abandoned the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, went amidſt the preſs to ſeek out their Maſter for to advertiſe him of it, and having by chance found him ſtill in fight with <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> they told him confuſedly that the Princeſs was carryed away. This diſcourſe equally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed them both. The Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> beleeved that <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> men had done it, who on the other ſide knew not what to think of it: At the ſame inſtant ſo great throng of people preſſed in amongſt them, as they loſt one another in the croud; and each of them ſeeking to be cleared in this matter, they got out of the Town ſpight of the obſtacles which they met with at the Gate, whereof the three parties had been Maſters more than once. I cannot repeat all this ſight unto you; but at length the Princeſſes people fought with ſuch courage, as they killed very near all the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> and <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> Souldiers. And when it appeared that there were no more enemyes in the Town, they ſhut up the Gate; Part of the Garriſon and of the inhabitants, having in the mean time purſued and made an end of defeating them, returned into <hi>Monaco.</hi> Hereupon the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> having certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the Princeſs had not been carried away by <hi>Don Fernando</hi> (for we learnt ſo much by certain Souldiers) and ſeeing that he was hurt, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to do more, and that he had loſt his Rivall in the preſs, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60144:96"/> to get to his Veſſell. As for <hi>Don Fernando</hi> he found himſelf yet in a ſtranger condition, all his Souldiers having been well neer ſlain, or fled away whilſt he was fighting with the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> he beheld himſelf almoſt alone, covered over with wounds, and not knowing what to do, having no Veſſell to facilitate his flight by Sea, nor any ſecurity on Land for him, with ſo little company. It is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conſidering what I have ſaid, that ſeeing himſelf in that eſtate, and perceiving that the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> followed by ſome of his men, made towards the port, he with his Souldiers mingled amongſt them, and entred into his Veſſell with him; the darkneſs of the night favouring the deſign, which doubtleſs he had to kill the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and to make himſelf maſter of his Veſſell. For when the day began to break there was a great noiſe heard on the Port ſide, which made every one to get up on the walls for to ſee what the matter was. The Princeſs and I went up to the top of the lodgings where we were, which looked upon the Sea, and whereas it was grown very light, we ſaw a Veſſell, that was making from the Port, and on the hatches a great number of men fighting together, whereof ſome tumbled alive into the Sea, and others fell down dead at their enemies feet. In the midſt of this diſorder we knew the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> by their apparell, who combated with ſuch violence, as moved the Princeſs to compaſſion, but at length, the Veſſell ſtill getting further of, we ſaw that after a long combat theſe two Rivalls remained fighting almoſt alone, and preſently after both of them tumble down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hatches; and ſo on an inſtant the Veſſel vaniſhing, we could no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thoſe two couragious Lovers, who more happy in this ſad adventure, than they were aware of, made the Princeſs ſhed teares of pitty; but ſhe ſhed them abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as in her return unto the Caſtle ſhe beheld ſo great a number of dead bodies as the ſtreets were even covered with them. The Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> Maſter of his horſe was found living ſtill, as well as he whom <hi>Don Fernando</hi> had ſent into the <hi>Milaneſe;</hi> and it was by their meanes that we came to learn the particularities of this Hiſtory, which without them I could not have told you; for the Princeſs underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding who they were, cauſed them to be very carefully looked unto, that ſhe might learn that which I have related. The Captain of the Gate, and the traiterous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant were found amongſt the number of the dead, and as if the Prince of <hi>Saler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> Maſter of his horſe, and <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> Agent, had prolonged their lives but only to tell the Princeſs what ſhe deſired to know, they dyed within a few dayes of their hurts. As for their Maſters we heard aftervvard, that being fallen dovvn as it were dead, in the manner as I have told you, the remainder of the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> men having made an end of killing thoſe which had followed <hi>Don Fernando de Mendoza;</hi> and believing their Maſter to be dead, three or four of them took up the body of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> for to caſt it into the Sea, vvhen as the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> coming out of his ſvvoon, and ſeeing vvhat they vvere going to do, recovered ſo much ſtrength as to forbid them from it; generoſity being greater in him than ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or revenge. This commandement of the Prince vvas executed, and that too of ſeeing vvhether he had any life remaining in him; and vvhen it vvas reported unto him that he ſtill breathed, he charged them to have as much care of him as of himſelf; as indeed he vvas looked unto and treated in the ſame manner. I vvil not declare the converſations of theſe tvvo Rivall unto you, but in brief it ſufficeth to let you know, that the Prince of <hi>Salernoes</hi> generoſity ſo nearly touched the heart of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> as he ceaſed to hate him, and would needs land with him at <hi>Naples</hi> to be throughly cured there. And as if on the healing of their wounds that of their minds had depended, they ſurmounted the love which they bare to the Princeſs, the firſt out of reaſon, and the other out of his pride. And each of them following his own ſenſe, they ſent to the Princeſs, &amp; wrote unto her, the laſt with rhodomontades, according to the humor of his Nation, and the other with a great deal of civility; beſeeching her to remember that ſhe had promiſed her friendſhip to the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and praying her alſo to attribute all that had paſt to the paſſion of the Painter <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio,</hi> and not to him, who vowed alwaies to ſeek occaſions to ſerve her, and to publiſh every where, that ſhe was the admirableſt creature on the whole earth.

This faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lover no ſooner ſaw her, but he complayned for that ſhe would have concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an adventure from him, where things had paſt, which heaped glory and confuſion on him; how it was almoſt as much as to ſay, that ſhe repented the having of too advantagious thoughts for him, in that ſhe would not have let him have known them; but ſhe anſwered him very obligingly, that the remembrance of others miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes alwaies touched her ſo ſenſibly, when as ſhe eſteemed herſelf the cauſe of them, as ſhe thought ſhe ſhould render herſelf guilty of thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerno</hi> and of <hi>Don Fernando de Mendoza,</hi> if ſhe ſhould hear them without grief, and that having deſired to avoyd all occaſions that might bring her to a ſenſe of ſadneſs, in a time when ſhe had the pleaſure to ſee him, ſhe had withdrawen herſelf.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN as <hi>Juctiniano</hi> was retired to his lodging, and that he had commanded his ſervants to leave him alone, after they had got him to bed, his imagination repreſenred unto him more lively, than ever it had done before, the inconſideration of his voyage; the promiſe he had made to <hi>Soliman</hi> to return unto him; the neceſſity, either of breaking his word with a prince who had ſo much obliged him, or to quit his Miſtreſs: Alas! ſaid ſhe, how unhappy am I, and how imprudent have I been? what ſhall I do in ſo deplorable an eſtate? What ſhall I ſay to the Princeſs? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came I to <hi>Monaco?</hi> Had I the deſign to betray her, in coming to marry her, and then to ſteal away from her the very next day? Or have I paſt my word for to falſifie it? No, no, that was not my deſign; I deſired to ſee <hi>Iſabella,</hi> my love car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me unto it, and doubtleſs it ought to carry me unto it; and were I to diſpoſe of my ſelf again, I ſhould ſtill do the ſame thing. And could I, ſaid he alowd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſee <hi>Iſabella?</hi> Then turning himſelf about with precipitation, he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his complaints. What, continued he, did I come to the Princeſs, only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her that I was Grand Viſier; that I was the chief of all the Orient; that I was the Favorite of a great Prince; and afterwards to abandon her to grief and diſpair, and ſo return again to enjoy all thoſe greatneſſes? Ah no, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> is not baſe; he will not quit a Princeſs, who is not unhappy but for the love of him; he will not ſacrifiſe her ſo cruelly to the pleaſure of a Prince, who may find men enough in his Empite, that will take the place which he held there; For in fine, if <hi>Soliman</hi> loves us, this princeſs loves us too; and if I have friendſhip for this Prince, I have love for <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Let us not balance the matter any longer, let us injoy the good we have, and let us not deſtroy our ſelves: Whereupon he thought that he had found ſome reſt, but on a ſudden a ſenſe of honor comming again into his minde, he went on paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately; Why, thou baſe man (ſaid he) canſt thou reſolve to cover thy ſelf with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy? to break thy word with one of the mightieſt Princes of the world, and that hath the moſt ſenſibly obliged thee? And doeſt thou believe that this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princeſs whom thou ſerveſt, would think thee worthy of her affection after this baſeneſs? Thou deceiveſt thy ſelf <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and with her own mouth ſhe hath pronounced thy ſentence: That which ſhe hath ſaid of this Prince, the praiſes which ſhe hath given him, makes me know but too well that ſhe could not eſteem one that ſhould betray him. But, continued he, if in this occaſion honor ſhould give place unto love, yet wouldſt thou not find thy ſelf at reſt, ſince this love well conſidered, will in this incounter have the ſame thing which honor requires:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60144:97"/> Seeſt thou not (wretch as thou art) that this Prince whom thou wouldſt betray, is the moſt rigorous obſerver of his word that is in the world? and that if thou ſhouldſt fail in that which thou haſt given him, he is capable of coming with an Army of an hundred thouſand men, not onely to undo thy Countrey, but thy Miſtreſs her ſelf, as the cauſe of thy fault: Save her then from this miſchief, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſe thy ſelf for her, and follow the Fate which will have thee always unhappy. But wilt thou alſo deprive thy ſelf for ever (ſaid he further) of the ſight of <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la?</hi> of the hope of thy poſſeſſing her, which is to ſay, of all thy felicity, to render thy ſelf the moſt infortunate, and the moſt deſperate amongſt men? Yes, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve for it, and withall reſolve to dye. Have courage enough then, continued he, not to hide a thing from her which thou canſt not conceal without baſeneſs; ſpeak then, wretched man: but how dareſt thou tell her that thou art a Slave, that thou wilt abandon her, and that thou preferreſt thy word before thy love? No, that may not be, thou canſt not conſent unto it, and death hath ſomething ſweeter than this wofull ſpeech. But again, added he further, wilt thou conſent to the undoing of <hi>Iſabella?</hi> and thou that canſt not reſolve to betray <hi>Soliman,</hi> wilt thou betray this Princeſs, by diſguiſing the truth unto her? Wilt thou be ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as to let her mary a Slave: Ah, this thought is too unjuſt! No, no, be far from ſo bad a deſign, do only that which thou oughteſt to do, and leave the reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fortune: let her intreat thee ill, let her perſecute thee, let her purſue thee every where, it imports not, ſo as thou doſt nothing contrary to that which thou oweſt to <hi>Iſabella.</hi> It was in this manner that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> agitated in his mind ſo difficult a thing to reſolve on; and honor and love tyrannized him ſo cruelly, as his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was almoſt loſt therewith. But at length, after he had paſt the greateſt part of the night without ſleeping, he generouſly reſolved to ſpeak plainly to the Princeſs, and in this deſign preſt with wearineſs and thought, ſleep ſurprized him whether he would or no, or to ſay better, a dull and melancholy vapor brought a ſenſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon him, which yet could not keep his imagination from repreſenting ſtill unto him the deplorable condition wherein he was. Day being come, he found himſelf ſo altered, as one would hardly have beleeved, that the miſeries of the mind could in ſo little a time have brought ſuch a notable change to the face. As ſoon as the Princeſs was in an eſtate to be ſeen, ſhe ſent him a complement to advertiſe him of it, whereupon he came ſtraightway to her Cabinet, but with a countenance ſo pale, and eyes wherein grief was ſo viſible, as <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſurpriſed with it; But whereas ſhe did not believe that he had any cauſe to be afflicted, ſhe thought he was ſick, told him that he ſhould not have come out of his lodging in the caſe he was in, asked him what he ailed? whether he had a feaver? whether it were ſtill on him? and finally propounded very many queſtions unto him, whereto <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not a word. For upon the point of executing that which he had reſolved he felt ſo extraordinarie a trouble in his mind, as he ſuddenly paſt from paleneſs to redneſs; he was taken at firſt with an univerſall ſhivering which made him to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and then with ſo great a burning, that he ſeemed all on fire. The Princeſs ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in this caſe, conjured him again with more earneſtneſs to acquaint her with the cauſe of all theſe alterations in him, that they might labor to give ſome remedy unto it. Alas! Madam, (ſaid he unto her with ſomewhat a low voice, that he might not be heard by one of the Princeſſes women, who was at the other end of the Cabinet) the knowledge which I ſhall give you of my diſeaſe will not make you find a remedy for it; for it is of a nature not to be cured, but by death. Yet if I ſhould ſuffer it my ſelf alone, I would not complain of it; but I am afraid that it would be contagious for you; that the knowledge which you ſhould have of it would increaſe my grief by cauſing yours; that I ſhould be more infortunate in your perſon, than in mine own; and that in concluſion you would be yet more to be lamented than I, who deſerves the miſeries which oppreſs me, ſince I am the cauſe of all yours. The Princeſs judging rightly by this diſcourſe, that there was ſome great matter to be known, commanded her woman that was ſtill in the Cabinet, to go and ſtand at the door for to keep any from coming to interrupt her.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60144:98"/> This order given, ſhe turned back to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and ſcarce knowing what to ſay, or what to demand in ſo unexpected an occaſion, ſhe beheld him a while without ſpeaking, neither durſt he likewiſe open his lips; but after ſhe had recollected her ſpirits, and knew that it concerned not the ſickneſs of the body, having a great and generous ſoul, ſhe ſaid unto him with a firm and aſſured voice; What mark have you had, my dear <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> of my little affection, or of my weakneſs, that you fear ſo much to give me a part in your griefs? No, no, caſt off this fear, and permit me to tell you, before you acquaint me with that which I can neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, nor comprehend, that beſides the loſs of your affection, there is no misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune wherein I ſhall not receive ſome comfort, partaking it with you. Ah! Madam, ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> interrupting her, ceaſe to be unjuſt in being too good to me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that when you ſhall know the point where at this preſent we are, you will finde that I have reaſon to be greatly troubled in reſolving to acquaint you with it. Why, ſaid the Princeſs, exceedingly impatient, concerns it life, liberty, or honor? if it be the firſt, provided I may die before you, I have felt ſorrows ſharper than death; if it be the ſecond, and that I may be a ſlave with you, I will accuſtom my ſelf to wear irons; but if it concerns honor, I confeſs that we have reaſon to deſpair, and that to conſerve it, any thing is to be done: you ſee, ſaid ſhe unto him, that I am prepared for the greateſt misfortunes, and for ſuch as ſeem to be the furtheſt off from me; hold me no longer then in pain, if it be true that I have any power over you. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſeeing he could not avoid it, went on with his Hiſtory from the point where he had left it, he recounted unto her his pains, his unquietneſs, and his joys, when as he knew that ſhe was not inconſtant; that not knowing what els to do, he had been conſtrained to acquaint <hi>Soliman</hi> with his whole life; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the permiſſion which he had obtained to come and ſee her was but for ſix months only, having ingaged his word to that Prince to return unto him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely within that time. Judge (after this, Madam, ſaid he with ſighs that well neer ſuffocated him, and that ſcarcely ſuffered him to ſpeak) whether my complaints be not juſt, whether I am worthy of your favour, and whether death alone be not the remedy which I can find for my miſeries. For conſider (I beſeech you) the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull eſtate whereunto I am reduced; which way ſoever I turn me I ſee you ſtill infortunate, but unhappy and infortunate only for the love of me. Ah Madam! if you knew how touching this object is, how ſenſible and grievous it is, you would eaſily apprehend the evill that I ſuffer; it is ſo great, as there is no expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtrong enough to repreſent it well: You have believed me to be dead, and I have thought that you were inconſtant; your vertue hath been tryed by a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and my crime hath been puniſhed with ſlavery; but when as fortune ſeemed to be weary of perſecuting us, when as your conſtancy was ſufficiently known, and when as my crime was puniſhed enough, ſhe made ſome truce with us: I knew that you lived for me, and you were not ignorant that I always lived for you. I am returned Madam, but muſt I repeat it once again? I am returned a Slave, fortune hath but lengthened my chain, and not broken off my irons. You ſeem, Madam, continued he, by your ſilence to tell me that I had done better for your reſt, not to have returned, and to have left you in the belief of my death, than to come for to aſſure you that I do live, but that I do not live for you. I think, Madam, that reaſon is on your ſide, but it is a reaſon which I cannot follow. My voyage is not an effect of my reaſon, nor of my will; I never ſtuck at the taking of this reſolution, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my ſenſe and my love, and my paſſion ſo mightily blinded my reaſon, as my ſoul abandoned it ſelf wholly to joy. I no longer thought that I was to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but only that I was going to <hi>Monaco,</hi> that I ſhould have the pleaſure to ſee you there, and that afterwards I could not be unhappy. In fine, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I have not done that which I ought, but I have done that which I could not chooſe but do. In the mean time I have no ſooner ſeen you, but I have beheld you as a good which I was to loſe, and as a perſon which I have made unhappy. For Madam, if I break my word with <hi>Soliman,</hi> I am an infamous creature, I ſhall put your State and your Honor in danger; and if I abandon you, I am treacherous to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60144:98"/> you, and cruell to my ſelf; and to ſay all, I am ſo unhappy as death alone can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor me: But for all that Madam, it is you that muſt pronounce my ſentence, and diſpoſe of my life. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> then felt himſelf ſo preſt with grief, as he could ſay no more. The Princeſs, who had heard him with a great deal of attention, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and ſorrow, was alſo a good while without anſwering him; agitating in her ſelf ſo difficult a thing to be reſolved. She was then leaning with one arm on a little table of ebony, looking on <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who durſt not lift up his eyes for fear of incountring thoſe of the Princeſs, which were full of teares; But at length this generous perſon, who had a great and noble ſoul, brak off her ſilence, and ſaid unto him with a conſtancy, which hath ſcarce any example; I confeſs, my deareſt <hi>Juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For know, that I am too generous to ſuffer you to teſtifie your love unto me in an unworthy way; and I am raviſhed to ſee you love glory, as much as me. No, <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> you muſt not break your word with a Prince, who hath ſo much obliged you; for ſo ſhould you be both ingratefull and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; neither muſt you too abandon a Princeſs, who loves you ſo dearly; for ſo ſhould you be both cruell and unfaithfull; and if you love her perfectly, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe it.

That is not my meaning, replyed the Princeſs, and to clear it unto you, you muſt return again to that generous Prince who hath loved you ſo much; I am no leſs obliged to him than you, ſince I ow your life unto him; and for this reaſon, together with that of honor, I will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You have told me already, that <hi>Soliman</hi> permits you the exerciſe of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I may enjoy the ſame grace, either as paſſing for your ſlave, or for your vvife. And then again, I have not forgotcen that you have told me, how this Prince hath made you hope, that if he could ſupport your abſence during the time of the ſix monthes which he hath given you, he would grant you your full liberty: Let us go then, my dear <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and demand it of him with teares; Do not ſtain your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in breaking your word with ſo excellent a Prince; and offend not your love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The generous diſcourſe of the Princeſs had wrought ſtrangely on <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> during the time that ſhe ſpake to him, though he left not harkening unto her; and this propoſition gave him a great deal of joy, though he meant not to accept of it.

At firſt he conſidered the dangers whereunto ſo dear a perſon might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, either by tempeſts, or by Pirates: But that which moſt troubled him, was, that knowing how <hi>Soliman</hi> had a ſoul as amorous, as ever Prince had any, and remembring withall, that he had been in paſſion for a picture which reſembled <hi>Iſabella</hi> a little, he believed already that this monarch was his Rivall; and by a moments reflection, he fortified his reaſon ſo well, as he had generoſity enough to refuſe a good, which was the uttermoſt term of his felicity. The Princeſs had no ſooner given over ſpeaking, but beholding her wich a little more confidence than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60144:99"/> before. Muſt you, Madam ſaid he unto her, ſurmount me in love, as well as in greatneſs of courage? No, it would not be juſt. Leave me the onely thing whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I can pretend, and poſſeſſe all the other vertues, wherein I can have no part. I muſt in this occaſion, Madam, ſhew you, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> knowes how to love, and by the hardeſt tryall that can be deſired of a Lover; I will make you ſee that my love conſiders nothing but you alone; that it is wholly diſintereſſed; that I regard not my ſelf; that in fine I am as perfect a Lover, as you are generous. But this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ah how cruell it is! And how hard a matter it is to refuſe that which one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires! Yet it muſt be, and nothing can diſtract me from it. To teſtifie my love unto you then, Madam, at that height which ſpeak I of, I muſt not accept of the offer you make me; I muſt refuſe to mary you; I muſt abandon you; I muſt deprive my ſelf of all my felicity; I muſt fight with all my deſires; I muſt deſtroy my ſelf; and I muſt become the moſt wretched of all men: Behold, Madam, all that I can, and all that I ought to do for you; for to expoſe you to tempeſts, to the fury of Pyrats, and to conſent that you ſhould mary a ſlave, is a ſacrilegious thought, which would render me the moſt criminall perſon in the world, and which ſhall never arrive unto me. It would be enough indeed for fortune to make me feel my own miſeries, during ſo fatall a voyage, without inforcing me to reſent thoſe which ſhould happen to you. Let me depart then, Madam, or to to ſay better, let me dye. I will doe neither the one, nor the other, ſaid the Princeſs, and in this occaſion you ſhall not diſpoſe of your ſelf. Nevertheleſs it is needfull that you ſhould give me a publique act of your will, before I can execute mine. Reſiſt me not, <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> unleſs you deſire to offend me; ſuffer me to follow you with honor, and put me not in the condition of increaſing the number of thoſe indiſcreet ones, who many times have followed their Lovers, without being their wives. Think of my glory, I conjure you; and think too, that if you abandon me, I may peradventure be capable of forgetting it. Do not expoſe me, I beſeech you, to that perill, ſince it is greater for me, according to my apprehenſions, than the dreadfulleſt tempeſt that you can deſcribe unto me. And fear not I pray you, continued ſhe, either ſhipwrack, or Pirats; if we periſh together, we ſhall dye almoſt without grief; if we be made ſlaves, you will help me to bear my chaines; or if we be ſeparated, the fury of thoſe barbarians ſhall do no more, than what you would now do. Ceaſe, Madam, from adding to my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> interrupting her, complain of my misfortune, but complain not of me in this cruell adventure. When I parted from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I blindly followed my paſſion; but at this preſent, Madam, I will blindly follow reaſon: She will not have you follow a wretch, and an infortunate man; Do you not conſider, how if it ſhould happen that I ſhould dye, in what an eſtate you would remain? Ah! my dear Princeſs (if I may be permitted to call you ſo) give over ſo wofull a deſign: Live in tranquility, whilſt I go and combat my evill fortune at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> with a promiſe, if I cannot overcome it, not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her victory very long. But it may be we ſhall not be ſo miſerable; <hi>Soliman</hi> hath a great and vertuous ſoul; that which I am going to doe may pleaſe him; he may be moved with my teares and prayers; he may break that inviſible chain which tyes me unto him; and being no longer a ſlave, you might then without ſhame accord me the honor, which now I refuſe. This hope is too weak, ſaid the Princeſs, to make me change the reſolution I have taken: No, <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> to ſpeak to me thus, is not to love as you ſhould; this is to blind me with an artifice, to doubt of my affection and courage, and to ſay all, this is to offend me ſenſibly. My teares ſhall not hinder yours from having their effect, but contrarily I am of a ſex accuſtomed to vanquiſh even cruelty it ſelf with ſuch like armes: Suffer me then to ſhare this victory with you, if you are to carry it; or that I may be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed with you, if you are to be ſo. You do not conſider, Madam, ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> that if <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould ſee you at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it would be the meanes of never obtaining my liberty, becauſe I ſhould then have all there that could render me happy. The Princeſs ſtood a whiles to anſwer ſo preſſing a reaſon; But whereas her affection would not be ſurmounted; May I not follow you, replyed ſhe, without

No, Madam, you cannot, anſwered <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> there is ſomething that is ſo great and ſo dazeling in your face, as you could not conceal your ſelf; But it is not for this reaſon alone, that I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto; I love you, Madam, and that is to ſay all: I will keep my word then with <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſince you do conſent unto it, if it be true that I can abſent my ſelf from you, without dying in diſpair: and all the grace which I demand of you is, that you will not diſpoſe of you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſufficeth it not that I will have it ſo, replyed <hi>Iſabella,</hi> for the obliging you to obey me? No, my Princeſs, it is not enough, anſwered <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and my miſery is arrived to that point, that I muſt for the love of you oppoſe you; and I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my ſelf of all that I am owing to you, but in diſobeying you. The Princeſs then found herſelf ſo ſeized with grief, as ſhe remained a long time without abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſpeak: the uſe of her eyes was almoſt gone, and ſo was that of her teares too for the eaſing of herſelf; ſo much had the exceſs of her ſorrow ſuſpended all the functions of life in her: She was negligently leaning on the table neer to which he ſate, and without giving any ſign of ſence, ſave that of breathing, ſhe was in an eſtate of moving to pitty even cruelty it ſelf. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſeeing her ſo, was affraid ſhe would have ſwooned: He took her by the hand, and beſought her to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that great courage, which ſhe had alwaies ſhewed againſt the perſecutions of fortune. It is not fortune that ſurmounts me, ſaid ſhe ſighing, it is thy inſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Ah! Madam, replyed he falling down on his knees before her, and wetting her hand with his teares, wholly tranſported with love and grief, will you have me render my ſelf infamous, break my word, and not return to <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> I am ready to obey you. This couragious Princeſs did her uttermoſt then to take heart again, and beholding him with eyes whence the firſt teares began to iſſue forth; No, my <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> I would not have that, ſaid ſhe unto him, but onely I would have you promiſe me, that within the time you are to ſtay here, you will obtain the reſolution from your ſelf to mary me, and to permit me to follow you; for in concluſion I cannot conſent, that we ſhould be ſeparated from one another but by death alone. This laſt word was no ſooner pronounced, but the Princeſs found hee ſelf very ill; ſhe became pale and languiſhing; her eyes, that were ſo clear, ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and ſo full of fire, grew dead and dull on a ſuddain; and gently cloſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up, ſhe fell backward on her chair, her head leaning on the left ſide, and weakly reaching out her right hand to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who was ſo ſurpriſed to ſee her ſo changed in an inſtant, as he could not forbear crying out pretty lowd. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing herſelf to ſpeak, ſhe bid him with a low voyce, not to fear the end of an evill, whereof the beginning was ſo violent, foreſeeing well that fortune was not yet weary of perſecuting her. But <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> without anſwering her, opens the Cabinet door, calls her women, who frighted to ſee her in that caſe advertiſe <hi>Aemilia</hi> of it; and loſing their reſpect in this ſorrow, they demand of her all at once what ſhe ayles? What her diſeaſe is? and ſo buſie themſelves in ſuccoring her, as they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her no ſervice at all. But ſhe being unwilling to give them leiſure to inquire it to the cauſe of her ſickneſs, did her uttermoſt for to tell them in half opening her eyes, that ſome days paſt ſhe had indeed foreſeen that ſhe ſhould be ſick, and having neglected thoſe little ſymptomes which ſhe had concealed, ſhe perceived very well that ſhe was entring into a fit of a feaver, which was beginning upon her by this weakneſs that ſhe felt. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> admiring her wiſdom and prudence, did what he could to imitate her; and concealing a part of his grief, he perſwaded her to goe and lye down on her bed; but having not ſtrength enough to ſuſtain her ſelf, they carried her in the ſame chair wherein ſhe ſate to her chamber, whither her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60144:100"/> where already come, for being incountred by good hap in the Caſtle they had been advertiſed of this accident by one of the Princeſſes women. They beheld her, feel her pulſe, ask her queſtions, to come to the knowledge of her diſeaſe, and not able to find out the cauſe of it, they teſtifie by their actions, and by their unquietneſs, that not knowing it perfectly, they are troubled how to reſolve on the choice of the remedies that they would apply thereunto; At length they ordain her to be laid in her bed, that ſtill they might gain time to think of that which they had to doe. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> out of reſpect retired all in diſpair, and without being able ſo much as to reaſon about his misfortune, his ſorrow became ſo ſtrong, as he felt it but confuſedly. The Princeſs was not long in her weakneſs, and Nature do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her uttermoſt, gave her ſpirits the liberty again which grief had areſted: But thereupon, there was ſo great and ſuddain a revolution of all her humors, as ſhe fell into a violent feaver, ſo that the Phyſicians knowing then the Princeſs diſeaſe, albeit they were ignorant of the cauſe of it, they began to treat her according to the precepts of their Art. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was alſo deſired by order from the Princeſs to repair unto her; he obeyed, and came into her chamber, with a face wherein the grief of the mind ſo nearly reſembled that of the body, as he ſeemed to be ſicker than the Princeſs. He approches, every one withdrawes, and when the Phyſicians told her, that after ſuch an accident as this which had befallen her, it was fit ſhe ſhould not ſpeak much, ſhe aſſured them that their converſation ſhould not be long; as indeed all that ſhe ſaid to <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was, comfort your ſelf for the love of me, if you will have me live for the love of you, and be mindfull not to ſpeak of our misfortunes, no not to <hi>Doria</hi> himſelf if he comes hither. And whereas ſhe ſaw that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> could not anſwer her without diſcovering his grief, ſhe wrung him gently by the hand, and calling <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ſhe commanded her to have a care of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> untill her ſickneſs was abated. This infortunate Lover, not daring to ſpeak, for fear of augmenting the Princeſſes diſtemper, and making too much ſhow of his diſpair, which ſhe would not have him to do, retired away without ſaying any more, than, Ah! Madam, if you will have me comfort my ſelf, you muſt then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of this ſickneſs, which I have been the cauſe of. After that, the Princeſs grew extremely worſe and worſe; the feaver held her ten daies with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and weakneſs together, as the Phyſicians durſt not warrant her life: But it was nothing in compariſon of the eleventh day, for then <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who ſcarcely had abandoned her all that time, abſolutely beleeved that ſhe was a dead body. The feaver was very much increaſed, her ſtrength diminiſhed, the remedies unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; Nature ſeemed to want power, and to be ſo oppreſſed, as it was impoſſible to hope that ſhe ſhould eſcape. But in the midſt of all thoſe miſeries, and in ſo great an extremity, the conſtancy of the Princeſs was admirable; who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Aemiliaes</hi> teares, the cryes of her women, and <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> diſpair, who was no longer in the termes to ſuffer himſelf to be conſtrained by reaſon, expreſſed ſuch a tranquillity of mind, as it might well be judged, that life was not very dear unto her: Yet could ſhe not for all that indure <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> lookes, nor ſee his teares trickle down his cheekes without reſentment, and beſides that deplorable object, ſhe was inſenſible to all things. But whilſt they were in theſe termes at <hi>Monaco,</hi> there was nothing but rejoycing at <hi>Genoua,</hi> where it was not known that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was ſo ſick as ſhe was; for from her firſt time of being ill, ſhe had given in charge that it ſhould not be publiſhed, to the end ſhe might recover without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, or at leaſtwiſe dye quietly. It was onely then knowen at <hi>Genoua</hi> that ſhe was not well, but that kept them not, from meeting almoſt every day; according to the order which the Marquis had eſtabliſhed, either at the Counts, or at <hi>Doriaes,</hi> who after his return had taken an onely ſiſter, that he had, to govern his houſe; and who was aſſociated with this fair Troop, which had no other thought but of delighting themſelves.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60144:100"/> love began to be ſomewhat violent for <hi>Sophronia,</hi> who certainly was very capable of begetting an ardent paſſion; ſhe had not only a piercing and majeſtick beauty like her ſiſter <hi>Leonora,</hi> but a noble ſtatelineſs, which rendred her leaſt civilities ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that one of her looks touched more ſenſibly, than the tendereſt careſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The beauties of her ſoul were no leſs conſiderable than thoſe of her face; and the graces of her mind did not give place to all the other excellent qualities that ſhe had; it is not to be wondered then, if <hi>Doria,</hi> who was a man of much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and of much judgement, ſuffered himſelf to be touched with ſuch powerfull charms. As for the Count, it might be ſaid that he loved <hi>Leonora</hi> his wife dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it may be ſaid alſo, that he was truly in love with nothing but glory: His galantry, his civilities, and his liberality, were not terminated with the conqueſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There were many others beſides which had alſo both wit and beauty, ſo that the Marquis being joyned to ſo many excellent perſons, it might have been ſaid, that this Aſſembly had been perfect indeed, had <hi>Juſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> and the Princeſs of <hi>Monaco</hi> been there. The next day after that the Count, <hi>Doria,</hi> and the Marquis were returned to <hi>Genoua,</hi> this illuſtrious company failed not to meet at the Counts Palace; and whereas it was forbidden to ſpeak in theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, either of war, or of generall affairs; and that Verſes, Painting, Muſick, Love, Vertue, and all other things that depend of an excellent wit, were thoſe onely, wherewith one might entertain himſelf in this encounter; the conſtancy of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> the merit and love of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> made an overture to the converſation. The beauty of the place alſo added ſomething to the beauty of the Aſſembly; for the more magnificence, and making of the better and more glorious ſhow of their jewells, thoſe dayes wherein the women decked and ſet forth themſelves all the windows were ſhut up, and torches ſerved to light the room, which this day <hi>Leonora</hi> cauſed to be ſumptuouſly furniſhed, becauſe the company was to be more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. The hangings were of Carnation Velvet, imbroidered all over with tears and ſpangles of gold and ſilver; the bed, chairs, and ſtools were of the ſame; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Perſian Carpet, the floor was covered with a great piece of Gold, Silver, and Carnation Silk tinſell. This chamber was lighted with thirty Candleſticks, whereof the one half were of gilt Vermillion ſet with Stones, and the others of Chriſtall ingraven, and garniſhed with gold. Round about this Chamber hung at an equall diſtance, great Plates of Gold-ſmiths work all ſet with precious ſtones, and upon a Cabinet of Nacre and Corall, a great vaſe of Agate, and two baskets of Gold ingraven full of artificiall Flowers. There were alſo between theſe Plates great myrrors, with the Pictures of all the Ladies of the company; and the ſame placed in ſuch ſort, as oppoſite to every myrror hung the Picture of a Lady, drawn in the habit of a Nymph, or a Goddeſs. The beauty and magnificence of ſo many agreeable objects, did without doubt excite ſome more than ordinary joy in all the Aſſembly; and in ſo charming a place it had been very difficult for one not to have been wounded with love, which preſents not it ſelf but in the middeſt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60144:101"/> one to begin ſome other diſcourſe; I would never have believed, ſaid he, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Genoua</hi> in the middeſt of twenty of the faireſt perſons of all <hi>Italie,</hi> I ſhould be conſtrained to ſend my mind to <hi>Monaco,</hi> there to encounter my Miſtreſs. It is not, continued he, becauſe it is an effect of <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s charms, or of the change of my humor; but it is becauſe I ſeeing never a woman here, for whom I have not already been in paſſion, I am inforced to conſerve that for her ſtill. And certainly if I had thought I ſhould have tarried ſo long at <hi>Genoua,</hi> I ſhould have taken a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order for my affairs. I would have loved <hi>Hypolita</hi> a full moneth, <hi>Sophronia</hi> as long, and ſo all the reſt; by which rule I ſhould have needed but twelve Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every year: But in the manner that I have carried my ſelf I am utterly ruined. For my part, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> with her joviall humour, I will forget if you will, that ever you were in love with me, to the end, you may not give any occaſion of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our Aſſembly: and I aſſure you that if you could reſolve to make a new declaration of love unto me, I am deceived if you would not love me more the ſecond time than the firſt. I have known ſince, continued ſhe, that I was to indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to you; I commended the firſt Verſes that you made for me; I took too much care in learning a ſong which you gave me; I danced better with you than with all others, and I know not any teſtimony of eſteem and good will which I did not render you; in the mean time you quitted me cruelly, to love the ſevere <hi>Sophronia,</hi> whoſe coldneſs could not keep you from ſerving her ſix days longer than me; and I confeſs that I ſhould not be ſorry to know for what reaſon her rigors have charmed you more, than my complyances and favors; to the end, that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we have ſuch another adventure, I may govern my ſelf therein with addreſs. But I pray you, added ſhe, do not content your ſelf with telling me, that the ſame thing arrives almoſt to all the world, that difficulties and obſtacles augment Love, ſince cuſtom paſſes not for a good reaſon with me, and that all which I can do, is to follow it only in apparell. It is certain, beautifull <hi>Leonida,</hi> anſwered the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, that this matter is a little too delicate to be diſputed with you; but ſince you have denounced war againſt me, it ſhall not be to offend you that I do anſwer you; hear then, if not a ſatisfaction to your complaints, at leaſtwiſe a reſolution to your doubts. I think, if I underſtand well that which you marvell at, and that which you cannot comprehend, it is but to know by what reaſon rigors and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect do augment love, rather than careſſes and favours: but if I deceive not my ſelf, it will not be hard for me to demonſtrate it unto you. No man is ignorant but that beauty ingenders love, and ſo love is no other thing but a deſire to poſſeſs beauty, in ſuch ſort, that if love be a deſire, it will be ſo much the greater, by how much the thing deſired ſhall be difficult in acquiring; ſince being once poſſeſt, the cauſe of the deſire utterly ceaſes: wherefore it is not an improper action for Love, but forced and neceſſary, to be more vive and earneſt in rigors than favors, ſeeing they excite and entertain it. But to explain my ſelf more clearly, I ſay, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire cannot be at reſt, becauſe at the ſame inſtant that it arrives at its end, it ceaſes to be deſire: So that if love be a deſire, as I have already ſaid, what ſtronger proof can one have to ſhow that it ceaſes to be love, than to ſee it arrived at its end? But if (fair <hi>Leonida</hi>) you ſhould not agree that love is a deſire, I think at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that you will not deny but that it is a fire, ſince ſo many have told you, that they burned for you, as you cannot be ignorant of this truth. But if you conſider the effects of it, you will ſee that I am not altogether out of reaſon; fire is of a nature ſo active, as it conſumes all that oppoſes it; if any thing reſiſts it, if we ſtop its paſſage, far from the end which we had propounded, that which ſeemed ſhould have ſerved for oppoſition, ſerves it for nouriſhment; for in concluſion, fire is quick and ardent as long as it finds reſiſtance; but as ſoon as it hath vanquiſhed, and that it hath nothing left to conſume, it conſumes it ſelf, and ceaſes abſolutely to be fire, when it hath nothing more to vanquiſh. If it be then true that love is a fire, it is true that it kindles by difficulties; that rigors ſerve to foment it, and when it happens that it hath nothing left to ſurmount, it loſes its being like the fire, and ceaſes abſolutely to be love. Let us not marvell then any longer, if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60144:101"/> with careſſes, and augments with rigors. You have ingeniouſly defended your opinion, replyed <hi>Hypolita,</hi> and ſatisfied the beautifull <hi>Leonidaes</hi> doubts, but not thoſe which your diſcourſe might have begotten in the mind of the Miſtreſs whom you ſerve, if ſhe have any friend here, ſeeing if it be true that one is to attend that effect from your love which you ſpeak of, ſhe would not be very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in favouring you, ſince that would be for her to furniſh arms her ſelf for her own deſtruction. If I had had any intereſt in this company, anſwered the Marquis, I had not explaned my ſelf in this ſort: But I would fain know, ſaid <hi>Sophronia,</hi> why that which <hi>Leonida</hi> calls rigor in me, hath not wrought that effect in you which ought to be expected from it? I mean the augmentation of your love, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to what you have told us, your deſires having never arrived at their end, and your fire having always found many obſtacles, it ſhould have been ſtill as lively for me, as the firſt day that you ſpake to me of this flame. All that I have ſaid, replyed the Marquis, are generall rules, which convene not perfectly with me, yet is it notwithſtanding true, that the death of deſire is in me, as in all men, the death of my love; and if I ſhould not ceaſe from deſiring, I ſhould neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ceaſe from loving. But by a particular grace the term of my love is to love, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire little, and I am eaſily repulſed. If I obtain at firſt that which I would have which is to be received favourably, I am arrived at the term that I propounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſelf; and if I do not incounter it, I have ſo delicate a ſpirit, as being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ever to hope for any but facile things, in loſing my hope, I loſe the love too which I had for the cruell one; and changing of object, I arrive ſtill at my end, which is to love eternally. But if this reaſon which is particular to me, doth not ſatisfie you, I have no more to ſay than this, that as we ſee Amber and the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and ſo many other wonders which are in Nature, working by reaſons that are hidden from the knowledge of men, ſo am I inconſtant in that manner, by a particular vertue, whereof I cannot reach the cauſe, and which at this preſent doth alſo inforce me to have no more but good will for the fair <hi>Leonida.</hi> It were fit then, ſaid <hi>Leonora,</hi> to the end we may not be troubleſom to you now, that you would talk to us of your paſt-loves, ſince you can finde none here that is worthy to be beloved of you twice. We know already, ſaid the Count, that which befell him in his Countrey, and that which hapned unto him here in <hi>Genoua;</hi> but we know not his adventures in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and the propoſition which you have made cannot be but very pleaſing to the company. For my part, ſaid the Marquis, I will not reſiſt it, and I will indeed acquaint you with one. But whereas the anger he was in, for that he could not be amorous in this place, had taken up his thoughts, he acquited himſelf of it after an extraordinary way; yet was it not without muſing attentively on that which he had to ſay, never regarding whether all the company were in caſe to hear him or no; and after he had performed all the ceremonies of a man that prepares himſelf for a long Narration, he began to ſpeak in this ſort.</p>

                  <head>The third Hiſtory of the Marquis.</head>
                  <p>I Loved a woman paſſionately, that was of a condition equall to mine, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my affection, whether feignedly or truly, I know not; but I know that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the honeſt favours from her which I could expect; and that at ſuch time as I was the moſt favourably intreated by her, without having any occaſion to complain on my part, nor ſeeking any pretext on hers, ſhe forſook me for another. Behold the end of my Hiſtory. The whole company then broke out into ſuch a laughter, to ſee that his attention, his ſilence, and the preparation which he had brought to the hearing of a long adventure, had been paid with ſo ſhort a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they thought they ſhould never have given over. It muſt be acknowledged ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> at length, that if they which write our <hi>Romanzes,</hi> did make them deliver their Relations in this ſort, we ſhould not admire, as we do, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60144:102"/> memories of their Heroes, who make narrations, which cauſe them to paſs whole daies without eating, and nights without ſleeping. For my part, ſaid the Marquis, I found my ſelf ſo ill with ſuch another adventure at <hi>Monaco,</hi> where I recounted my follies of <hi>Genoua</hi> to the Princeſs, as I am fully reſolved never to fall into the like again; and I ſhould rather chuſe to talk to the beautifull <hi>Aemilia,</hi> whom I did love, and ſtill doe love whether I will or no, than play the Aſtrologer a ſecond time. In the mean while <hi>Doria,</hi> who was infinitely deſirous to ſpeak to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia</hi> of his growing paſſion, thought there was no better way to make the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall converſation ceaſe, and bring on a more particular one, than to propound the Muſick, for the charming of the Marquis his bad humor. To which effect then he told the Count, that if harmony had at other times had the power to appeaſe the fury of ſome, it might eaſily allay the melancholy of a man that was not accuſtomed to have any. The Marquis, who could not be deceived with ſuch like things, preſently perceived <hi>Doriaes</hi> deſign; and to vex him a little he told him, that the remedy which he propounded unto him could not work but upon the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and ſo by conſequence, it would be unprofitable for him. But after he had waggiſhly cauſed the converſation to endure a little longer, he was the firſt that preſt <hi>Leonora</hi> to impoſe ſilence on the company by a conſort of lutes, which ſhe had made them hope for. The Count then aroſe, and puſhing open the door of a Cabinet, he ordained the Muſicians to begin. In the mean time the Marquis, who was willing to oblige <hi>Doria,</hi> ſaid, that the Ladies were firſt to be placed, where they might beſt hear; thereupon he made a demy-circle of chaires ſome four or five paces from the Cabinet door, wherein he placed all the women, and behind every Lady, he ſeated a man, playing the Maſter of the ceremonies ſo dextrouſly, as without any ſhew of affectation in his choice, he placed <hi>Horatio</hi> behind <hi>Hypolita,</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> cloſe to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia,</hi> who failed not to make uſe of ſo favourable an occaſion: For after they had harkened a long time to an excellent conſort of Lutes, with a ſilence worthy of ſo charming an harmony, and that he ſaw how in the aſſembly each one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular began ſoftly to commend that which ſeemed to be the moſt agreeable in the Muſick, he took the liberty to ſay unto <hi>Sophronia</hi> with a low voice; I may not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deliver my opinion of thoſe exquiſite leſſons I have heard; becauſe the ſmall attention that I have lent unto them, would not permit me to be an equall judge thereof. Doubtleſs the thought which hath diverted you from it, replyed <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> turning her head about towards him, was either very pleaſing, or very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick. It was both together, anſwered <hi>Doria,</hi> and if I might preſume to make you the conſident of a matter that imports as much as my life, you ſhould ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion that I am not far from the truth. It is for you to conſider, ſaid ſhe unto him, whether this ſecret, if it may be told me, would be advantagious to you for me to know it; and on the contrary, I being of a ſex that is accuſed of being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceal any thing, whether you are to fear the expoſing of your ſelf to the hazard of my publiſhing that which you ſhall have told me. If that were the onely obſtacle, replyed <hi>Doria,</hi> that could keep me from ſpeaking to you, I ſhould not be long without diſcovering the botom of my heart unto you, ſeeing I am but too ſure, that you would never tell that which you had known of me: But there needs ſo much boldneſs in daring to declare unto you, that you are adored, as I dare not undertake it. <hi>Doria</hi> was no leſs ſurpriſed for having ſaid ſo much, than <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> who bluſhed at firſt, and hyding her face with a fan of carnation feathers, which ſhe held in her hand, ſhe was conſtrained, to avoid being ſeen of all the company, to turn herſelf yet more towards <hi>Doria.</hi> But whereas ſhe very much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, ſhe was contented to ſay to him notwithſtanding her ordinary ſeverity, You have ſo ſurpriſed me with the concluſion of you diſcourſe, as I have not the judgement free enough to diſcern, whether it be a caſt of your wit, or a deſign to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing I have an inclination to honor you, I will believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining the matter, that it is the firſt I have ſpoken of. But whereas it might happen, that if any one ſhould hear this gallantery continue any longer, one would not have the ſame indulgence for you, as I have ſhewed you; and that your words
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60144:102"/> might be interpreted more diſadvantagiouſly, both for your glory, and mine; do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will obey you, anſwered <hi>Doria,</hi> but remember; that nothing ſhall ever alter the reſolution I have taken to love you eternally. <hi>Sophronia</hi> returned no anſwer to theſe laſt words, and turning her ſelf to <hi>Leonida,</hi> who ſate next her on the right hand, for to demand of her how ſhe liked the Muſick, it fell out that in going to avoid one diſcourſe of love, ſhe interrupted another; For <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be in a ſtrong paſſion for <hi>Leonida,</hi> had laboured to ſhew it her with the moſt addreſs that poſſibly he could. But whereas ſhe was of a wily humor, and would contrary to that of <hi>Sophronia,</hi> cunningly conceal things which were near her heart, by feigning to diſcover them; in ſtead of anſwering to <hi>Sophroniaes</hi> queſtion, ſhe ſaid unto her ſmiling, and pointing to <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> this Cavalier hath talked ſo much to me of love, as I had no leiſure to mind the Muſick. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at this diſcourſe, but ſeeing that ſhe did not behold him, either with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or contempt, he ſaid unto her with addreſs; there appeared ſo much of it in your eyes, as it would be as difficult for one not to be taken with it, as it would be impoſſible for you to bemoan the evills which you are the cauſe of. Whilſt theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable perſons entertained themſelves in this ſort, <hi>Horatio</hi> was not ſo happy, for whatſoever care he took about it, he could not obtain one favourable look from <hi>Hypolita,</hi> whoſe jealous humor had made her beleeve that he had beheld <hi>Leonida</hi> with too much attention, whether it were that he had obſerved <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who ſpake ſoftly unto her, or had without deſign caſt his eyes that way; but in concluſion all that ſhe anſwered to whatſoever he could ſay unto her, was to pray him with a quipping geer not to be <hi>Alphonſoes</hi> Rivall, who was her brothers friend, for fear leſt the ſhare which ſhe was to have in all his intereſts, might oblige her to break with him. At the ſame inſtant the conſort ceaſed, and the Count deſired the company to renew their attention for the hearing of a Dialogue, ſung by two moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent voyces; after which the Marquis, who had ſet himſelf down by <hi>Leonora,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the converſation ſtill for ſome time with his ordinary addreſs; and then all this fair Troop departed away, but with different thoughts. <hi>Doria</hi> felt himſelf ſo ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, for having made his firſt declaration of love to his Miſtreſs, that he was as much ſatisfied therewith, as if he had received a great favour from her. But though <hi>Sophronia</hi> eſteemed very much of <hi>Doria,</hi> though he was of an illuſtrious race, though he was beloved of her brother-law, and that according to apparent reaſon ſhe could not make a fitter choiſe, yet was there a particular one, and that was hidden to all the world, but not unknown to her, which made her fear the ſequel of this paſſion. For ſhe was not ignorant that the Count, albeit he eſteemed of <hi>Doria</hi> in particular, yet bore an irreconcilable hatred to the whole family in generall, though in his actions and words he teſtified the clean contrary. It was in this ſort that this beautifull and prudent maid reaſoned with her ſelf, not doubting but that <hi>Doriaes</hi> diſcourſe was unfeigned, becauſe ſhe was ſufficiently perſwaded that he would not eaſily venture to ſay ſuch like things unto her, having alwaies mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

On the other ſide, <hi>Leonida</hi> was not ſory for having touched the heart of <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> and this new conqueſt made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home with joy. As for <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> he could not very well judge of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unhappineſs, ſo much did the proceeding of <hi>Leonida</hi> ſeem extraordinary unto him; howbeit he had ſome hope in the gentleneſs of her lookes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed no rigor unto him. <hi>Hypolita</hi> had more ſullen and unquiet thoughts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe had no juſt cauſe for them; but it is ſufficient to ſay that ſhe was jealous for to perſwade one that ſhe went not away very well contented. As for <hi>Horatio,</hi> he was ſo afflicted with his Miſtreſſes odd humor, as he could not reſolve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his own houſe, till he had ſought for ſome comfort from his ſiſter <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> vvho lived vvith <hi>Leonora,</hi> becauſe her mother vvas dead: He vvent then to her chamber to communicate his thoughts unto her. Ah! ſiſter (ſaid he to her vvhen he came vvhere ſhe vvas) I am the moſt unfortunate of men, and <hi>Hypolita</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſteſt of your ſex. It may be you call that injuſtice (ſaid <hi>Sophronia</hi> unto him)
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60144:103"/> which I ſhould call vertue. No, no, replyed <hi>Horatio,</hi> and I deſire that you vvould be my judge, if you have nothing elſe to doe, and can intend to hear my reaſons. I am vvell contented, ſaid <hi>Sophronia,</hi> but I am ſo ill informed of that vvhich hath paſt betvvixt you theſe ſix monthes, vvherein I knovv you have loved <hi>Hypolita,</hi> as I am in doubt vvhether I may judge rightly. It is true, anſvvered <hi>Horatio,</hi> that I vvas vvilling to acknovvledge unto you, that I loved her, and that ſhe hated not me, vvithout recounting my adventure particularly unto you, becauſe I alvvaies thought that diſcourſes of this nature did not pleaſe you: But albeit you have the goodneſs novv to let me entertain you vvith the eſtate of my affaires, I vvill not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat unto you the firſt ſpeeches of Love, vvhich I had vvith <hi>Hypolita,</hi> ſeeing they are for the moſt part all alike amongſt vvorthy perſons. and vvhereas time preſſes me, I vvill onely give you an accompt of all that hath arrived to me ſince, but it ſhall be in fevv vvords. I ſerved her then vvith aſſiduitie enough, as you might vvell obſerve; and even to that point as ſhe was no longer able to doubt of it. I perceived by her lookes, that my perſon did not diſpleaſe her; that my wit and my humor contented hers, and then when I expected ſome teſtimony of affection for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of my paines, gueſs, my dear ſiſter, what it was that ſhe gave me, and the onely one that I received? <hi>Horatio</hi> ſtayed a while, in expectation of <hi>Sophroniaes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, who preſently ſaid unto him laughing, I think, brother, that I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treſpaſſing againſt good manners ſhew my ſelf very ſpirituall, in gueſſing at the favors which may be done to a Lover; wherefore it were fitter that you ſhould let me know what this favour was, than to trouble me to tell it you. Harken to me more ſeriouſly, I conjure you, replyed <hi>Horatio,</hi> and know that this teſtimony of affection, which I have ſo often received from <hi>Hypolita,</hi> was not the giving me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to ſee her, or to ſpeak to her in particular; it was not an obliging letter; it was not a bracelet of her hair; it was not a picture; it was not aſſuring me with her own mouth that ſhe did not hate me; but it was telling me, that I did not love her, and that I loved another. In fine, the firſt proof which I had of her affection, was a mark of her choler; and to expreſs my ſelf more clearly, jealouſie alone hath ſhewed her love to me. You cannot receive a more undoubted proof thereof, ſaid <hi>Sophronia</hi> interrupting him: Nor a more grievous one too, replyed <hi>Horatio.</hi> For you muſt know (continued he) that after I had done an hundred incivilities to ſatisfie her, whereof you have many times demanded the cauſe of me, though I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver told it you; yet could I not cure her mind of this fancy; And of all the women of quality of <hi>Genoua,</hi> I do not know one, that hath fair hair, which ſhe hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that I have been in love withall, <hi>Leonida</hi> onely remaines, who at this preſent ſticks in her ſtomack, and for whom ſhe hath ill intreated me to day. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Sophronia,</hi> you are to take comfort, and be carefull to juſtifie your ſelf unto her; for when her jealouſie ſhall want an object, ſhe will queſtionleſs be conſtrayned to give you another mark of her affection. Ah, ſiſter, replyed <hi>Horatio,</hi> you are but little acquainted with this paſſion! it formes phantaſmes, it deceives the ſenſe, it illudes reaſon, and without any ground, or ſubject, it leaves not to work in thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth; it makes them to ſee that which is not; makes them believe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible things; and utterly perverts the underſtanding. At leaſtwiſe, ſo far as I have obſerved it in others, for I have never tryed it otherwaies, which certainly hath been crueller to me, than if I had been jealous my ſelf. Bemoan then, my dear ſiſter, the miſery, wherein I find my ſelf ingaged, and whence I know not how to get out. Verely I doe bemoan you, ſaid <hi>Sophronia,</hi> and ſo much the more, for that I doe not know how to eaſe you. I am eaſed already, anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> by recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my torment unto you; but it is time to let you go to <hi>Leonora. Horatio</hi> departed then half comforted in having diſcovered his grief to the vertuous <hi>Sophronia,</hi> but the next day was no ſooner arrived, but he was taken with his unquietneſs again; which made him go in all haſt to <hi>Doriaes</hi> houſe, though he could not hope to ſee <hi>Hypolita</hi> ſo early; but he was happier than he thought he ſhould have been, for it fell out that <hi>Doria</hi> was in his ſiſters lodging, at ſuch time as he was advertiſed that <hi>Horatia</hi> asked for him: And whereas he was not ignorant of the paſſion he was in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60144:103"/> for <hi>Hypolita,</hi> he would needes have him come into her chamber, howſoever ſhe withſtood it, to the end he might oblige him to a like courteſie, when there ſhould be occaſion for it. <hi>Hypolita</hi> received <hi>Horatio</hi> ſomewhat coldly; but yet with civility, being unwilling her brother ſhould ſee their petty diſorders. <hi>Horatio</hi> thought that he had never ſeen her ſo beautifull, as ſhe appeared to him in a neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full habit, which ſhe had put on, with an intention not to have been ſeen of any body all that day. Their firſt diſcourſe was of the laſt evenings entertainment, but after that had continued a while, <hi>Doria</hi> went into his ſiſters Cabinet, to write a letter to <hi>Sophronia;</hi> for he was not yet fully ſatisfied with the declaration he had made her; and though he was long about it, yet could he not draw up one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented him, ſo much did he fear to offend <hi>Sophronia.</hi> He thought that the incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which he uſed in leaving <hi>Horatio</hi> upon his going from him, would be in ſtead of a favor to him; ſo that onely making him a complement about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He was no ſooner alone with her, but he undertook to juſtifie himſelf, and gave her ſo many reaſons to make it appear to her that he did not love <hi>Leonida,</hi> as all her jealouſie could not furniſh her with one to oppoſe his: After that, he beſought her to call to mind the care he had taken to pleaſe her; the extreme affection which he had alwaies born her; and how many times ſhe had permitted him to interpret her reſentments and choler to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <hi>Hypolita</hi> heard him with a great deal of attention, but for all that he could not perſwade her, for with a precipitous voyce ſhe ſad unto him; Suppoſe that your indeavours and ſervices have been powerfull enough to obtain my affection, yet have they not been powerfull enough to conſerve it; and thereof I could bring you a thouſand teſtimonies; but whereas they are matters wherein your excuſes might give me ſatisfaction, and not deſiring to receive any from you, I will not furniſh you with meanes to doe it; but to convince you, I will onely ſay one thing, which admits no reply, and which all your cunning cannot deſtroy. Have you not ſeen me, continued ſhe, receive the civilities of the youngeſt of the <hi>Fregoſes,</hi> of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the <hi>Adornes,</hi> and of ſome others, without regarding yours? Have you not been in ſome aſſemblys where that laſt hath alwaies taken me out to dance, whilſt I have ſcarce ſo much as turned my look towards you? Have I omitted any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of teſtifying unto him, when you paſt with him before my window, or in all other places where I might have you for a witneſs, that his love did not diſpleaſe me? No, <hi>Horatio,</hi> I have omitted none, and the affection which I bore you, made me have recourſe to this artifice, hoping I ſhould know, by giving you ſome cauſe of jealouſie, the force of your paſſion; but I have not ſeen, though you have ſeen all theſe things, that you had any ſenſe of them; and albeit I knew that by this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward experience I ſhould be in danger of loſing you, if you were ſenſible, yet choſe I rather to reſolve upon it, and to aſſure my ſelf of your love, than to conſerve you with a luke-warm and indifferent affection. I have ever heard, that jealouſie is the daughter of love, yet do I not ſay that love cannot be without jealouſie. Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will tell me, that by my own reaſons I am unjuſt in complaining of you, ſince it is poſſible, that you may have love without having jealouſie. But alas! this diſcourſe hath not ſo much as an apparent reaſon, neither can I ſuffer my ſelf to be perſwaded to that which I deſire ſo paſſionately. And to ſhew you that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force my mind to deceive my ſelf, hear a thing, which hath made me to think upon this matter. I have been perſwaded then, that love alone cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce jealouſie; and how it is neceſſary that jealouſie ſhould have a mother which may contribute to her birth; this mother, if I be not deceived, is occaſion; and as love without her cannot produce jealouſie, ſo ſhe without love canot beget jealouſie. This reaſoning ſeemes ſo powerfull to me, as you cannot make any objection which it deſtroyes not; for in fine, you may well have love without jealouſie, when as you have no occaſion for it; but I having given it you, and you not having taken it, is to ſay abſolutely, that you have had no love. Ah! fair <hi>Hypolita,</hi> anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> how I doe rejoyce at theſe complaints of yours? for the more reaſons you have brought to maintain your opinion, the

You ſay then, amiable <hi>Hypolita</hi> (continued <hi>Horatio</hi>) that there can be no love without jealouſie, and becauſe I have not been jealous, I have had no love; you ſhall pardon me if you pleaſe, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing the reſpect which I ow you, I dare take the libertie to contradict you, in maintaining with reaſon, that the perfecteſt and ſincereſt reaſon is that which admits of no jealouſie.

Now if the love of beauty, which is that whereof we ſpeak, ſprings from an object that is pleaſing to the ſight, it followes, that ſo long as this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſeems amiable unto us, ſo long will our love continue; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the perſon beloved anſwers our affection, or anſwers it not, this love ſhall be ſtill the ſame love. But that I may make uſe of a compariſon as well as you, a man ſees a fair Lady, and love ariſes in his heart, is it neceſsary for him to examine whether this Lady be ingaged to another in affection? it is certain that it is not; and it is every day ſeen that love doth ſubject us to them, whoſe love is ingaged otherwhere: ſo that one may wel judg from thence, that a man ought to perſevere in his love, though ſome cauſe be given him of jealouſie, ſince when he was not beloved, and that he was induced to love by the only ſight of beauty, he left not to be infinitely amorous. And if I may be permitted to make uſe of Hiſtory in this encounter, what ſympathy, or what affection could that young <hi>Athenian</hi> expect, who became ſo deſperately in love with a beautifull Statue, and whoſe paſſion was ſo extreme, as the like was never heard of? It is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he loved only to love, ſeeing the object of his paſſion was abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any correſpondence. Now then if it be true, that a Lover is ſatisfied in knowing that he loves, he is moſt aſſured that jealouſie is not of power enough to deſtroy his love, and that this jealouſie is rather an effect of a defective, than of a perfect love. And to ſpeak freely unto you, tell me, I pray you, who can be ſo hardy, after a worthy perſon hath had the goodneſs to receive our ſervices favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to teſtifie ſome affection unto us, as to ſuſpect ſhe ſhould have the ſame thoughts for another? Ah, fair <hi>Hypolita,</hi> the gallantry and civility which you have uſed to the eldeſt of the <hi>Adornes,</hi> could not oblige me to draw ſo bad a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence againſt you. And to comprehend all the reſt of my reaſons in one alone, I am but to ſay, that he who by his diſcourſe gives ſome marks of his jealouſie to his Miſtreſs, names her inconſtant, facile, and almoſt infamous: Judge now, fair <hi>Hypolita,</hi> whether theſe be words agreeing with a Lady. In the mean time it is moſt undoubted, that in what tearms ſoever jealouſie is expreſſed, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed but in this manner: whereas quite contrary, this confidence which we have in the perſon beloved, which makes us to approve of all her actions, is the true mark of perfect love, and indeed merits the moſt acknowledgement, if I may be permitted to ſay ſo. I have not ſuſpected you then, beautifull <hi>Hypolita,</hi> of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, becauſe I have eſteemed you very much; and if I had had as good a place in your heart, as you have had in mine, you would queſtionleſs have done me ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For whether he had been too long without eating or ſleeping, or that grief alone had been the cauſe of his indiſpoſition, he found himſelf within a ſhort time, in a ſickneſs as deſperate as that of the Princeſs, who not ſeeing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, was very inquiſitive to know where he was. The Phyſicians and <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> who feared ſhe would afflict her ſelf too much if ſhe knew the truth, told her, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> having ſeen her quite out of danger, and being preſt by an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affair which had be fallen him at <hi>Genoua,</hi> was gone thither with an intent to have returned back again before ſhe ſhould have taken notice of his departure. But when they ſaw <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s ſickneſs grow dangerous, and that the Princeſs was as much troubled with hearing no news of him, as ſhe could have been if ſhe had known the condition wherein he was, they conceived it was ſit, fearing the ſad event of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s malady, to acquaint her with that which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from her. <hi>Aemilia</hi> was ſhe that charged her ſelf with this heavy Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe carried the matter ſo dextrouſly, as ſhe ingaged the Princeſs to ſpeak of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and to marv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It would not be hard for me, anſwered <hi>Aemilia,</hi> with a ſad countenance, to take you out of this unquietneſs, if I did not fear to give you another greater than that. Whereupon the Princeſs, leaning with her right arm on the pillow, and with her left hand alſo drawing the curtain, fixed her look on <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and after ſhe had been a pretty while without ſpeaking, as it were to divine of that which ſhe ſhould be acquainted with, ſhe ſaid unto her in ſuch a faſhion, as ſhewed that ſhe would bee obeyed; diſguiſe not the truth unto me, let me know my miſerie as great as it is, and tell me whether <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> be dead or unfaithfull; for provided he be neither the one nor the other, I ſhall receive all other misfortunes with a great deal of indifferencie. The laſt cannot be, anſwered <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and heaven will not permit that the other ſhould arrive unto you. But not to diſguiſe the truth unto you, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> never parted from <hi>Monaco,</hi> and the fear alone of redoubling your ſickneſs, in acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60144:105"/> you with his, hath kept us from telling it to you; but finding it to continue longer than we thought it would, I held it my duty to advertiſe you of it. You are a cruell creature, replyed the Princeſs, to conceal a thing from me, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes my life. And what will <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſay of the little care I had of him? It is by his order, anſwered <hi>Aemilia,</hi> that we have caried the buſineſs in this ſort. If you will have me pardon you this fault, ſaid the Princeſs, ſo order the matter, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> may not be ſurpriſed when he ſhall ſee me. <hi>Aemilia</hi> did what ſhe could then to keep her from getting out of her bed, but neither her intreaties, nor the counſell of the Phyſicians, could alter her reſolution. She calls her women, gets on a night-gown, and cauſing her ſelf to be held up by the armes, ſhe goes to <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> lodging, whom ſhe found ſo changed, as he could hardly be known. Aſſoon as he ſaw her enter he indeavoured to ſalute her, but being unable to lift up his head, he was conſtrained to be contented onely with turning his eys towards her, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her with a feeble and languiſhing voice, which could not be heard by any but her ſelf, for her women were a pretty way diſtant from them; At length, Madam, fortune ſhall not ſeparate us, and death is going to doe that, which I expected from the cruelty of the former: Nevertheleſs I ſhall die contentedly, ſince I have ſtill the pleaſure to ſee you, provided you will promiſe to live for the love of me, and that my memory ſhall be dear unto you; For I find this advantage in death, that it keeps me from being unfaithfull to you; It finiſhes the combat of love &amp; honor which could not be vanquiſhed in my ſoul; it makes me ſatisfie them both; and to ſay all, it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates us, but I do not forſake you; and I doe nothing in this occaſion, but what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but do. The Princeſs having her cheekes all bedewed with tears, anſwered him ſighing, I am not yet ſo far from the grave, but that I may enter into it with you if death ſhould carry you thither; but if you doe love me, you will ſtrive to live. Think not of conſerving your ſelf, ſince you have no will to it, but of conſerving me, and believe not that you can die without me. I have let you ſee what grief can do upon me; and I ſhould have no need, either of poiſon, or poignard, to quit me of this life, for the loſs of you alone would ſuffice for it. Think not for all this that I ſpeak to you thus out of the fear to die, it is an apprehenſion which is not my ſoul, and I doe not find death dreadfull but in the perſon beloved; let me not make tryall then of ſo ſharp a grief; live, if it be poſſible, and contribute at leaſt what you can unto it. I will indeed obey you, replyed <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> but take heed you do not thereby deprive me of a remedy which I ſhall not eaſily meet with again. As he would have proceeded, one came and advertiſed the Princeſs, that <hi>Doria</hi> having underſtood of his Friends ſikneſs, was arived at the Caſtle, and deſired to ſee him. The Phyſicians then approched to <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> bed ſide, and told the Princeſs, that if ſhe loved his life, ſhe was to let him reſt in quiet, and ſuffer few to ſee him. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> intreated them to let him imbrace <hi>Doria,</hi> who preſently was brought in.

The chiefeſt of the Phyſicians coming to <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> and feeling his pulſe, found that his feaver was increaſt, and judged by the unequall beating thereof, that the agitation of his ſpirit had redoubled that of his blood and humors; ſo that approching once more to the Princeſs, he told her that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was not to be ſuccoured with tears, and that ſhe muſt abſolutely be reſolved to leave him to their conduct, and not to ſee him again till he was in a better eſtate. Since my ſight is ſo deadly to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Princeſs, I muſt obey you, but I believe it will not be for any long time. This ſaid, ſhe went out of <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> chamber, after ſhe had charged him again not to reſiſt any remedy, and to remembrr that ſhe would have him live. <hi>Doria</hi> and <hi>Aemilia</hi> helped to lead her to her chamber; but that which was wonderfull in this incounter, was, that the Princeſs, who had not been out of her bed ſince ſhe thought ſhe ſhould have dyed, felt her ſelf leſs weak than before, and the deſire ſhe had to be able to aſſiſt <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> in perſon, whether the Phyſicians would or no, was ſo powerfull in her, as in four daies ſhe found her ſelſ in an eſtate ſtrong enough to be almoſt continually with <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> for the ſpace of two monthes and an half <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60144:106"/> that the violence of his ſickneſs laſted. During which time, the Count, <hi>Doria,</hi> and the Marquis, made many voyages to <hi>Monaco,</hi> and whereas <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable at <hi>Genoua,</hi> there was not a perſon of quality which took not great care to be informed of his health. All the aſſemblies, which were made at <hi>Leonoraes,</hi> were melancholy too; and their converſations, which were wont to be full of nothing but love and gallantery, were wholly now of the inconſtancie of things; of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of dying, and of the little laſtingneſs of the moſt aſſured pleaſures. They could not mervail enough, that after ſo long an abſence; after the eſcaping from ſo many misfortunes; after the drying up of ſo many teares; and when it ſeemed that nothing could oppoſe <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> and <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> content, they ſhould find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more unhappy than before: they knew not for all that how far their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs extended, for their ſecret misfortunes were without doubt the greateſt and moſt ſenſible. And when as <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> ſickneſs was no longer dangerous, and that he had recovered his ſtrength, then it was that he was the moſt afflicted. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſider the little time he had remaining to make good his word which he had given <hi>Soliman;</hi> and that he was to quit <hi>Iſabella,</hi> his grief became ſo great, as had not his ſoul been already long accuſtomed to melancholy, he could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dying have ſupported ſo grievous an apprehenſion. But a little while after he had begun to goe out of his chamber, for to repair to that of the Princeſs, being ſtill very feeble and languiſhing, he ſaid unto her with a great deal of pain; Now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is the time wherein you are to diſpoſe of me, and to let me know, whether I am to be wanting, either to my love, or to my honor; live with infamy, or die with glory; ſatisfie <hi>Soliman,</hi> or oblige him by the breaking of my word to ruine not onely all the Chriſtians that are in his Empire, not onely all <hi>Europe,</hi> but you too, who is more dear to me than all the world beſide. I think, Madam, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told your excellencie, what I ought to doe in ſuch a grievous caſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe then what you will have me to doe: But I beſeech you, make me no more ſuch propoſitions, as an exceſs of generoſitie would render unjuſt; hearken to nothing but reaſon in this incounter; do not follow that which your affection inſpires you with; and remember how I ought not to do any thing that is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the honor which I have to be beloved of you. I have told you already, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Princeſs, what power I have over my ſelf in this occaſion; and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſeemes ſo juſt unto me, as I can find nothing that can deſtroy it; For in fine, you will ſatisfie <hi>Soliman,</hi> and you will ſatisfie me alſo; I will doe nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my honor, and I will ſatisfie that which I ow to our affection: Reſolve then to mary me and to part away, and never hope that I will change my deſign. When you were at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did you believe that I had ſo little affection, as I could eaſily reſolve to receive a viſit from you, for to be deprived afterwards of your ſight, it may be for as long as live? Ah! Madam, ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> interrupting her, I had no other intent in parting from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> than that of ſeeing you, and of coming hither time enough to keep you from ſhutting your ſelf up in a Cloiſter. For underſtanding the reſolution you had taken for it, upon the belief you were in of my death, nothing could have been able to retain me. What, ſaid I, the incomparable <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhall make her ſelf an eternall priſoner for thee, and if fortune ever reſtores thee thy liberty, thou ſhalt find her without hers! Ah! no, no, rather doe any thing to hinder it. It was in this ſort, Madam, that I reaſoned with my ſelf; and that, together with the hope of ſeeing you, made me, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the matter, take my reſolution. And I believe I have accompliſhed that which I propounded to my ſelf; I have ſeen you, Madam, and having let you know that I am living, it is no longer in your power to diſpoſe of your ſelf, ſeeing your word keepes you from it; And for me, I promiſe you if I cannot break my chaines at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the newes of my death ſhall ſoon ſet you at liberty: For to expoſe you to all the misfortunes, which I foreſee, in permitting you to follow my fortune, is a thing that I will nevever conſent to. The Princeſs, ſeeing <hi>Juſtiniae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> firmneſs, ſaid unto him with a kind of tone, which teſtified ſome choler; if the reſolution you have taken be an immoveable one, add not to you cruelty, that of excuſing it with weak reaſons; and to take from you the meanes to doe it, I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60144:106"/> conjure you never to ſpeak to me more of it, for fear I ſhould not have power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough over my ſelf to keep me from giving you ſome markes of my reſentment. I aſſign you eight daies, to think yet of this important affair; but hope not in the mean time, to ſee me change my mind. I will obey you, Madam, anſwered <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> but if you knew to what an hard tryall you do reduce my ſoul by this exceſs of generoſity; and how difficult it is to refuſe, out of an exceſs of love, that which love it ſelf doth make us deſire, you would have the goodneſs without doubt not to give me a mark of affection, which love and reaſon will not have me receive. The converſation of theſe two Lovers finiſhed in teares and ſighes; and each of them reſting in their firſt determination, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> retired to his chamber, but in ſuch diſpair, as never man was in more. At length, after he had combated, but in ſuch diſpair, as never man was in more. At length, after he had combated ſufficiently within himſelf, he took his laſt reſolution; and knowing full well that the Princeſs would never permit him to part without her; neither would have him b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He told him moreover that he was obliged to ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Princeſs, who would not have him make this voyage without her; but being loth ſhe ſhould be expoſed to the incommodities of ſo painfull a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, he had concluded to part without ſaying any thing to her, but onely leaving her a letter. <hi>Doria</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe; but ſeeing that <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano</hi> ſpoke ſeriouſly, he offered (how amorous ſoever he was of <hi>Sophronia</hi>) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in this voyage; and the conteſtation which they had upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had not ended ſo ſoon, had not <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> told him that the neceſſity of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires required it to be ſo; and that to render him a proof of his affection it would ſuffice he ſhould furniſh him with meanes to get from <hi>Monaco</hi> ſecretly. That will not be hard for you to do, anſwered <hi>Doria,</hi> for yeſterday, when I arrived at the Port, I heard by chance of a French barque, that is bound for <hi>Venice,</hi> which parts away to morrow morning by the break of day, and no doubt will receive you, aſſoon as you ſhall preſent your ſelf; ſo that you ſhall have no more to doe, but to get abord her, and I will ſtay here to deliver your letter to the Princeſs. You will be but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to her for it, replyed <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> who was not willing that <hi>Doria</hi> ſhould be preſent at <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> receiving of a newes, which would ſo much afflict her, for fear leſt the conſtraint ſhe would be in, ſhould more augment her grief. He prayed him then not to ſee her, till he had her permiſſion for it. And whereas he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, who ſhould wait on him in this voyage? <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> anſwered him, that one of the conditions of his vow was, to goe alone and unknown. <hi>Doria</hi> oppoſed this as much as poſſibly he could, but vain was it for him to give any counſell to his Friend; and <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> taking a part of the money which he had at <hi>Monaco,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Doria</hi> to let him goe and write, and to get him to bed. After that <hi>Doria</hi> had obeyed him, and that all <hi>Juſtinianoes</hi> people were gone out of his chamber, except it were one, whom he had commanded to tarry in a withdrawing room till he called him, he leaned on a table, and looking on the paper which he found there, but without marking that which he looked on, he paſſed up and down in his mind all his paſt misfortunes, all thoſe which then he reſented, and all thoſe which he foreſaw for the future; but of all theſe deadly thoughts, the cruelleſt, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to be indured, was that which ſet before his eyes, how he was to abandon <hi>Iſabella:</hi> His heart was not ſtrong enough to ſupport with conſtancie ſo dolorous an apprehenſion; and his teares falling abundantly on his paper put him in mind how he was ſet there with a purpoſe to write: So that after he had ſpent a great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60144:107"/> part of the night in an eſtate which may be more eaſily imagined than deſcribed, he took a pen, and inſpired more by his grief than his wit, he traced theſe ſad words.</p>

                        <p>NOt having been able to ſurmount your generoſity, either with my tears, or with my prayers, I have at length ſurmounted mine own apprehenſions, both with my love, and with my reaſon. I have found that though Fortune will not let me be happy, yet that I ſhall at leaſt be unhappy alone; and that it is juſt I ſhould ſteal away from you, that I may ſteal you from the cruelty of Fortune, by keeping you from following of mine. I am gone then, Madam, or to ſay better, I do ſeparate my ſelf from my ſelf, in ſeparating my ſelf from you. I do obey the deſire which you had, that I ſhould ſatisfie my honor, by ſhewing my ſelf not unworthy of your love, and by a moſt ſenſible misfortune I am forced to abſent my ſelf from you, without having ſo much as the conſolation to bid you adieu, and to let you ſee by my tears what the grief is which I ſuffer. It is ſo great, Madam, that loſing the uſe both of ſight and reaſon together, I am compelled to ſhut it up in my heart, being impoſſible to expreſs ie. But before I leave you, remember that I beg the conſervation of your life of you, till ſuch time as you ſhall underſtand how heaven will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of mine. I have told <hi>Doria,</hi> that I am going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to accompliſh a vow, which I made for you during your ſickneſs; make uſe of this artifice as you pleaſe, and believe that before it be ſix moneths, I ſhall return happy unto you, or be dead with grief.</p>

                  <p>After that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had made an end of writing, and ſealed his Letter, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that ſervant, which he had ſtayed to wait on him, and willed him to deliver it the Princeſs three hours after his departure. And when this man demanded of him whether he would not go to bed, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> made a ſign to him to be gone, feigning as though he had ſomewhat els to write; but it was indeed becauſe his grief was ſo great, as not being able to ſleep, he thought that the agitation of his body would caſe that of his mind. He paſt the reſt of the night in walking up and down, with ſo great an unquietneſs, as one is not able to deſcribe that which he reſented. He oftentimes opened the window to ſee whether it were day; and though his greateſt misfortune was to part from <hi>Monaco,</hi> yet one would have ſaid, that he was impatient to be gone from thence; ſo much was his ſoul troubled, and ſo much was his reaſon confounded. In the mean time <hi>Doria,</hi> who had not ſlept all the night, hearing <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> walk, (for his chamber joyned to his) cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be made ready, and entred into his friends, juſt as the day began to break. He would yet have diſſwaded him from this voyage, and once more deſired him to let him accompany him, but <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> would by no means accept of ſo obliging an offer; ſo that <hi>Doria</hi> ſeeing his friends reſolution, was conſtrained to follow his pleaſure. And whereas the ſhadows of the night were almoſt quite diſperſed by the approach of the Sun, <hi>Doria</hi> went and treated with the Maſter of the <hi>French</hi> Barque for <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s paſſage, who followed him to the Port, his face covered with his cloak. The Guards of the Town and Caſtle, who ſaw him go forth ſo early, marvelled not at it, for during the little time wherein he had been well at <hi>Monaco,</hi> he had uſed to walk out at ſuch hours to entertain his thoughts at the Sea-ſide. The ſeparation of theſe two friends had been with more tenderneſs, if <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had been leſs afflicted; but love ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed his heart, as there was no more room left there for friendſhip: ſo that when he came to imbrace <hi>Doria,</hi> all that he could ſay to him, was to conjure him to have a care of the Princeſs. He would fain have diſcloſed the truth unto him, but <hi>Iſabella</hi> having forbidden him ſo to do, he durſt not diſobey her. He got aboard then being ſcarce able to ſpeak, and ſuffering himſelf to be diſpoſed of by them that received him, he abandoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not ſo much to the Sea, as to his grief. The Pilot having order given him to part, ſteered his courſe for <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſtanding up beheld <hi>Monaco,</hi> with his arms acroſs, and his eys full of tears, never marking <hi>Doria,</hi> who ſtill made ſigns of farewell to him from the Port, whereunto he returned no ſhew of anſwer at all. But when <hi>Doria</hi> had loſt the ſight of him, he went back unto the Caſtle, with a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60144:107"/> purpoſe not to ſhew himſelf to the Princeſs till ſhe commanded him, that he might exactly obſerve what <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had intreated him unto. In the mean time the three hours after his departure being paſt, he with whom he had left his Letter, went and delivered it to the Princeſs, who was but newly awake. At firſt when ſhe heard that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had ſent her that paper, ſhe changed colour, and asked where he was: He went forth very early with <hi>Doria,</hi> (anſwered this man) whom I ſaw return back alone to his chamber. Without doubt (ſaid the Princeſs then to her ſelf opening the Letter) <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> hath deceived me, and <hi>Doria</hi> to be faithfull to his friend, hath betrayed me. But when ſhe had read that which <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> wrote her, and that ſhe knew he was gone, as alſo that <hi>Doria</hi> was deceived as well as ſhe, though in a different manner, ſhe gave a great skreek: howbeit deſiring to conceal her grief from him that brought her theſe deadly news, ſhe commanded him to with-draw, and to ſtay in her houſe till he had further order. As ſoon as ſhe was at liberty to complain, what ſaid ſhe not againſt <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> againſt fortune, and againſt her ſelf? Am not I culpable of mine own misfortune? (ſaid ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>igh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) Ought not I to have had him watched? Had I not made ſufficient tryall of the ſtedfaſtneſs of his reſolution? he had reſiſted my intreaties, he was not moved with my tears, he would not hearken to my ſighs: With what ſtronger arms could I hope to vanquiſh him? but now is no time to reaſon of things done; <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> is gone, and how ſtrong ſoever my love is, I may not forget mine honor; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſolve to follow him as a forſaken one; he ſeparated himſelf from me that he might be generous; and that I may not ſwerve from vertue, I will not follow him. But what ſay I, unfortunate as I am? if I know not where he is, how can I follow him? Then ſuddenly holding her peace, and turning her ſelf on the other ſide, ſhe ſighed with ſo much violence, as it was impoſſible for her to ſpeak. A little after for all that ſhe fell to ſpeaking again in this ſort. Ah, <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) what a ſenſible outrage to my affection was this exceſs of love, that hath torn thee from me! the tempeſt whereunto thou expoſeſt thy ſelf, is to be leſs feared, no doubt, than that which is raiſed in my ſoul. Is it poſſible (continued ſhe) that thou couldſt reſolve to refuſe the having of me for a companion of thy miſeries? Certainly thou didſt not believe that my ſoul was ſtrong enough; and thou thoughteſt peradventure that I did not intreat thee, but to be denyed. But I ams cruell (ſaid ſhe) to make ſo ill a conſtruction of the meaning of the moſt generous of men; who deprives not himſelf of me, but for the love of me; who conſider none but my intereſts, and who loves not even his own honor, but for my proper glory. Let us think better of <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> let us live to obey him; and let us not give fortune that advantage, to have more cruelty, than we have conſtancy: Let us force her by our reſolution to be weary of hurting us, ſince indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left us but that to do. After ſhe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is not your friend cruell indeed (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Doria</hi> as ſoon as he came to her) to ſteal away from me, for the ſatisfying of a thing which he owed not but to my conſideration, ſeeing it ſeems to me that there is ſome juſtice I ſhould follow him in a voyage, whereof I was the occaſion. And if I may be permitted to accuſe you of too much fidelity towards him, I ſhall tell you freely, that you would not have a little obliged me, if you had betrayed his ſecret in diſcovering i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to me. There is ſometimes (added ſhe) a great deal of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity in not ſerving ones Friends according to their intention, and in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rather that which is utile and glorious, than what is pleaſing to them; and if I be not deceived, the matter ought to have gone ſo in this incounter. But in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> is gone, and there is nothing left us but to make vowes for him, as he hath made them for us. It is certain, replyed <hi>Doria,</hi> that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s voyage ſtange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed me; and that I was tempted to acquaint you with his deſign: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60144:108"/> Madam, when I knew that his voyage was abſolutely neceſſary, ſeeing he had promiſed it, and that he did not ſteal away from you but to keep you from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I found that he had reaſon for it, and I ſerved him in his deſign; Yet was it not till I had firſt offered to accompany him, with all the teſtimonies of affection I could render him; and I had added force to intreaty, had he not aſſured me that he ſhould not accompliſh his vow, if he went not alone and unknown. But is it poſſible that he is gone, ſaid the Princeſs? diſguiſe not the truth unto me, is he not concealed in ſome place, to take order for his affairs? No, Madam, anſwered <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> for he hath given me the charge of them. If that be ſo, ſaid the Princeſs, who would fain have been at liberty to ſhed teares, I hold it fit that you ſhould goe and publiſh at <hi>Genoua</hi> the true cauſe of his abſenſe, for fear leſt ſo unexpected a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould cauſe bruites to run about, either to his diſadvantage, or mine. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go, tell me I pray you, whether <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> were afflicted indeed to quit me? whether he ſaid any thing to you to tell me? and what were his laſt words? They were all for you, replyed <hi>Doria;</hi> for after he had imbraced me, all that he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his grief was no other than force enough to injoyn me to take care of you; ſo that Madam, you may diſpoſe of me as you pleaſe, and believe that never any eloignment begot ſo great an affliction, as that which I ſaw in <hi>Juſtiniano:</hi> And knew I not that he loves you more ardently, than ever perſon did love, I ſhould hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that abſence alone could cauſe ſo great a diſpleaſure in his ſoul. The Princeſs felt her ſelf then ſo preſſed with grief, as it was impoſſible for her to retain her teares, and ſeeing that ſhe could not hide them from <hi>Doria,</hi> ſhe ſaid unto him wiping her eyes; You may not think it ſtrange, that I am not more conſtant than <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> ſince I am as unhappy as he; and that I yeeld not to him in affection. This weakneſs juſtifies his, ſaid <hi>Doria,</hi> and I profeſs he were unworthy of the honor which you do him, if he did not reſent, as he doth, an abſence that ſeparates him from the onely perſon which can make him happy. The princeſs and <hi>Doria</hi> had ſome more ſuch like diſcourſes, but at laſt ſhe prayed him once again to return with all ſpeed to <hi>Genoua;</hi> and for that effect ſhe commanded a Veſſell ſhould be made ready to part away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after dinner. The thing was executed accordingly, <hi>Doria</hi> departed from her, and by her direction carried back with him a part of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s train, the Princeſs retaining the other in her ſervice till the return of their Maſter. The next day <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> arrived at <hi>Genoua,</hi> where he delivered the departure of <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> to all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Every one received this newes with mervail, but amongſt others, the Count, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> the Marquis, and all the reſt of his Friends, were not contented with merveling, they were extremely afflicted at it. And being all met together at <hi>Leonora</hi>'s, they talked a long time of this adventure; now though they doubted not but that it was in the manner as <hi>Doria</hi> recounted it, yet was not their reaſon for all that ſatisfied. They found ſomthing that was ſtrange in this voyage; and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Doria</hi> for ſuffering him to go. <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Sophronia</hi> were not of that opinion, and maintained that he had done well, in not hindring him from accompliſhing that which he had promiſed. For my part, ſaid the Marquis, I do not condemn <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> for it may be if I had been in his place, I ſhould have done the ſame thing; but if I had been in <hi>Juſtinianoes,</hi> when as the Princeſs was ſick, I am very ſure that I ſhould not have ſought for remedies ſo far of; and I would have choſen a pilgrimage, where ſhe might have eaſily followed me, to the end I might not have been ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her, after ſo long an abſence. But whilſt his friends lamented him, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons talked of it according to their humors; and as truth alters in going far from them which ſpeak it, ſo there were thoſe that affirmed, how <hi>Iſabella</hi> had made a vow during her ſickneſs never to marry, and that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> out of deſpair had been ſo precipitate. Others would have this vow, which <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was gone to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, to be made during his captivity. Some again ſaid, that the ghoſt of the Princeſs Mother had appeared unto her, and had forbidden her to mary him, ſo that being enraged at ſuch a reſolution he was gon to the warres. To conclude, they ſaid all things except the truth, which was not known to any but the Princeſs and <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano,</hi> who without regarding what was ſaid of him, had his imagination filled with nothing, but his misfortunes, and the incomparable <hi>Iſabella.</hi>

As ſoon as he was arrived there, he had no other deſign but of thinking of his departure from thence: And whereas there was a great commerce from <hi>Venice</hi> to all the Ilands of the Archi-pelago, &amp; to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf, it was not long before he met with a ſhip that was ready to ſet ſayl for the Iſle of <hi>Chio,</hi> ſo that it was not hard for him to get paſſage in her upon pretext of ſome important affairs, which he ſaid he had with certain <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Merchants of <hi>Pera.</hi> He imbarqued himſelf then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being known, and too proſperous in his Navigation, by reaſon of his eloign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Iſabella,</hi> he arrived at this Iland; where he was not long before he found a Veſſell that was bound for <hi>Pera,</hi> and ſhipping himſelf in her, he left the Ile of <hi>Mitilene</hi> on the right hand, and on the left that of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> now called <hi>Stali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> From thence he entred into the Streight of <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> where ſtand the two Caſtles of <hi>Seſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as he was at his Palace, and that he had received the complements of all his Officers, of whom he was exceedingly beloved, he went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> although it was not the cuſtom to enter there at ſuch like hours: but <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> whom henceforward we call <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> remembred his old privileges ſtill. The <hi>Capigis,</hi> which kept the gate, repulſed him ſomewhat rudely, but as ſoon as they heard his voice, they craved pardon of him, and a <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibaſſi</hi> went and advertiſed the grand Signior of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> arrivall. He was at that time in ſo profound a melancholy, as leſs than a name that was ſo dear unto
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60144:109"/> him, could not have made him anſwer him that ſpake to him; But the name of the Baſſa was not ſo ſoon come to his ear, as approching to this bleſſed Meſſenger, which brought him ſo pleaſing a newes, he demanded of him, if it were true that he was returned, why he did not come in as he was wont to doe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advertiſing him of it? This demand was a commandment to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigibaſſi,</hi> who preſently cauſed <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to enter. Aſſoon as he appeared, <hi>Soliman</hi> charged every one to withdraw, ſo that ſeeing himſelf at liberty, he imbraced him with ſo much tenderneſs, that though his mind was wholly taken up with love and his miſeries, yet found he himſelf ſenſible of ſo great an amity. Is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> unto him, that I ſhould receive this conſolation in my misfortune? but am I not to blame, continued he, to doubt that thou couldſt not be generous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to come back again? This doubt would queſtionleſs be an injurie, replyed <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> had it not proceeded from the impatience of my return, rather than from a diſtruſt of the promiſe I had made to thy Highneſs. It is not without reaſon, ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> interrupting him, that thou thinkeſt I have deſired it, for aſſoon as thou hadſt abandoned me, victory, fortune, and vertue abandoned me to. I became at once, both the moſt infortunate, and the moſt faulty of all men; and by the malice of another I loſt all that thy friendſhip had acquired me. I am no more the <hi>Soliman,</hi> whom thou thoughteſt worthy of thy eſteem, and to let thee know the deplorable eſtate wherein thou findeſt me, I have no more to ſay to thee, but that thou ſhalt never underſtand from my mouth the miſhaps that have befallen me, or to ſay better, the crimes which I have committed. However I will impart unto thee, that all that which my armes had conquered in <hi>Perſia,</hi> by thy valor and conduct, is revolted; that <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> are no longer under my power; that <hi>Ulama</hi> having been wounded, his Troops have been defeated; that my whole army hath been rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that <hi>Tauris</hi> is loſt; and that there is no more left me of all thy conqueſts, than the bare remembrance of thy victories. But, ah, how happy ſhould I be, if I had alſo loſt the moity of mine Empire, and had not made my ſelf unworthy of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the other! <hi>Soliman</hi> ſtayed here to fetch a great ſigh; and when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> would have anſwered him, he would not ſuffer it, but conjured him not to ſpeak at all to him, ſave onely to promiſe that he would never hate him, whatſoever he underſtood of his violences. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed to hear <hi>Soliman</hi> ſpeak in this ſort, as he ſcarce knew what to anſwer him.

He anſwered him then, that he would give his own eyes the lye, even when they ſhould report unto him that he had committed a crime; that he was too well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his juſtice and vertue to doubt of it; that great Princes might ſometimes appear culpable to the eyes of their ſubjects, and yet be innocent in their own ſoules; and that in fine, he gave him the ſame word, which he had ſo exactly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he would alwaies have the ſame thoughts for him, as he had formerly had. He beſought him withall not to conceal his misfortunes from him; but <hi>Soliman</hi> half comforted with the promiſe he made him, deſired him not to preſs him to it, and further obliged him by oath, not to ſpeak of his crimes when he ſhould come to know them; and ſhould onely believe that <hi>Roxelana</hi> was the cauſe of all his diſaſters. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſeeing how ſenſibly <hi>Soliman</hi> was touched, and perceiving well by his teares that this ſhould be ſome lamentable adventure, durſt not ſpeak to him more of it; and though he had reſolved to caſt himſelf at his feet, when firſt he came before him, to demand his libertie of him, hoping he had then been in ſome ſort accuſtomed to his abſenſe; yet held he not that a ſeaſonable time, and that he was to wait for another occaſion. This thought redoubled his grief yet more, ſo as that joyned to the melancholy which his diſpleaſures and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had painted in his face, made <hi>Soliman</hi> obſerve athwart his teares, that he was extremely changed. I will not ask of thee, ſaid he unto him, whether thy voyage
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60144:109"/> hath been proſperous or no; for I ſee ſo many markes of ſadneſs, both in thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and countenance, that feeling not my ſoul ſtrong enough to ſupport mine own misfortunes, I do not deſire to know thine, which would be no leſs ſenſible to me, than if they were arrived to my ſelf; for in fine, I love thee ſtill the more. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> returned no other anſwer to this diſcourſe, but a low obeiſance, and a deep ſigh, they continued yet a while in ſo ſad a converſation; but at length <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeeing it was late, and believing that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſtood in need of reſt, he diſmiſſed him, after he had told him with a calmer countenance, that as in going from him he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away all his good fortune and vertue, ſo he hoped that his return would bring him back ſo pretious a treaſure again; and that from thenceforward his innocence ſhould not be capable of being corrupted by anothers crimes. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> being returned to his Palace, found a ſlave of <hi>Ulama</hi>'s there, who underſtanding by the bruit which was ſpread abroad amongſt all the Grandes of the Port that he was come, preſented himſelf unto him, and delivered him a letter from his Maſter, who had ſent him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with order to attend <hi>Ibrahims</hi> return there, and to beſeech him to ſave his live in ſaving <hi>Felixana</hi>'s. For this ſlave, who had followed the fortune of his Maſter when as he changed party, had alwaies had a great ſhare in his confidence, principally in that which concerned <hi>Felixana.</hi> This name of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixana</hi> ſurpriſed <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> for he well remembred that this was the maid which had ſuffered ſhipwrack with the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had forcibly caryed her away; ſo that believing her dead, he could not comprehend which way ſhe ſhould be ſaved. He entred then into his chamber, and cauſing this ſlave to follow him, he opened <hi>Ulama</hi>'s letter, and ſaw that it was thus; for during the war of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he had learned that language perfectly enough, both to underſtand, and ſpeak it.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60144:110"/> Officers, he enquired of the generall report of affairs; but whereas they beleeved that the grand Signior had told him all, and that he himſelf was not ignorant of that which every one knew, he ſpake very confuſedly to him of theſe things. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Ibrahim</hi> picked that out of his diſcourſe vvhich vvas ſo lamentable in thoſe adventures, and which the grand Signior would not tell him. And truly it was almoſt an advantage to him, to be ſo afflicted with his own misfortunes, that he was thereby made the leſs ſenſible of thoſe of others, when they were paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For whereas he had alwayes protected the perſons whom this misfortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, he had reſented it more if it had fallen out at another time. But it is the cuſtom of the miſerable to have one prime apprehenſion, which in ſome ſort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them, to ſee that they are not the alone unhappy in the World: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Ibrahim</hi> received this news with tears; and this man continuing to recount unto him all that he knew, told him that there vvas a Princeſs priſoner in the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers (which is a place wherein none are ever put but perſons of quality) who was by report very much afflicted. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> doubted not but that it was <hi>Axiamira,</hi> though he had beleeved her to be dead; and having named her unto him, he confirmed him in that opinion. The grand Viſier, ſeeing he could learn no more, got him to bed with ſo much affliction, as he could not ſleep all that night. As ſoon as it was day his Palace vvas full of viſitants; the <hi>Begler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bei</hi> of <hi>Romania,</hi> that of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> the <hi>Boſtangibaſſi,</hi> and all ſuch as were of any rank in this Empire, preſented themſelves at <hi>Ibrahims</hi> riſing. After the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, ſome of them ſpake indeed of the diſorders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but none durſt ſay any thing to him of that which concerned the Imperiall Hown, or that which directly regarded <hi>Soliman,</hi> as well for the reſpect vvhich they bare him, as for the fear they were in, leſt being unable to diſcourſe of it without tears, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſhould know of it, and take it ill that they ſhould entertain <hi>Ibrahim</hi> vvith a matter, vvhereof he deſired the memory might be extinguiſhed: Neither durſt <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſpeak to them of it, having perceived vvell enough, by the confuſed relations vvhich had been made him, that <hi>Soliman</hi> vvas not abſolutely innocent of the misfortunes vvhich had hapned unto him. This converſation then vvas ſpent vvith conſtraint enough; and the hour of the grand Signiors riſing being come, the grand Viſior went to the Seraglio, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed vvith that multitude vvhich uſually ſtrive all they can to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves agreeable to him, vvho vvas ſo to their Soveraign. The grand Viſier made haſt to the Seraglio, to the end he might have the more time to go the ſame day to the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers, for to ſee the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> who knevv not that ſhe ſhould ſee her Protector ſo ſoon: For at the very ſame inſtant, when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was thinking of her liberty, ſhe was entertaining her ſelf with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lima,</hi> the Governors Wife of that Caſtle, whoſe inclinations were vertuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. She was well ſtricken in years, ſo that being ſufficiently informed of all that had paſt at the Port for a long time before, ſhe could eaſily ſatisfie the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which the Princeſs asked of her; who daily reſenting the effects of <hi>Roxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanaes</hi> wickedneſs, could not forbear complaining of her. The very ſame day, <hi>Halima</hi> going pretty early to bid <hi>Axiamira</hi> good morrow (for ſhe loved her very much) ſhe found her ſomewhat ſadder than ordinary. Shall I never ſee you, ſaid ſhe unto her, in a quieter mind? and ſhall not time work that in your ſoul, which it doth in all the World beſide? Ah! Mother (for ſo ſhe called her) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Axiamira,</hi> time vouchſafes not to vvork that effect in me, vvhich all the afflicted find by it; for could the misfortunes which have lighted upon me be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced out of my memory (vvhich will never be) others do daily arrive unto me, and every moment of my life furniſhes me with a freſh ſubject of ſorrovv; for indeed there is no juſtice in it, that I ſhould ſurvive ſo many generous perſons, and even mine ovvn hopes. Is there any new miſhap befallen you, replyed <hi>Halima;</hi> for the extraordinary langor which I perceive in your countenance, makes me, Madam, thus to demand the cauſe of it? It is this, anſwered <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> that as if I had not effectuall miſeries enough to proſecute me, my very

Now though I am not ſo ſcrupulous as to ſtand upon ſuch like things, yet I confeſs to you, that this unpleaſing illuſion hath ſo lively imprinted <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> true cruelties in my mind, as I cannot be perſwaded but that the phantaſm, vvhich I ſavv in my dream, reſembles her. Doubtleſs it hath much deceived you, ſayd <hi>Halima;</hi> for if her ſoul were as beautifull as her body, ſhe would be one of the perfecteſt women on the earth. You have ſo often promiſed, replyed <hi>Axiamira,</hi> to recount unto me by what artifices ſhe could come to ſhare the Empire with <hi>Soliman,</hi> and ſeduce ſo great a Prince as he is, that in the anguiſh wherein I am at this preſent, if you do not keep your word vvith me, nothing can charm my grief: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I doubt not but you will acquaint me with ſome of her wickedneſſes, which as yet I have not heard of, it would be ſome comfort to me to underſtand them, that I may hate her ſo much the more, and that I may learn what land hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo ſtrange a Monſter. I will gladly ſatisfie you, anſwered <hi>Halima,</hi> and as I have told you heretofore, I know this Hiſtory very well. For beſides the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall things, which no man is ignorant of, I am privy to ſome particularities, that are not known to all the World, and that by the information of a Slave, who was <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> favourite during that time, but was afterwards turned out of the Seraglio by her herſelf, in a phantaſticall humour, which makes her that ſhe never loves any one thing long, and hath ever ſince lived with me. You ſhall hear then that which you deſire to know, and vvhich I have learned from this Slave, and ſome others who were well acquainted therewith: But in regard you have time enough to ſpare, I will intermix the Hiſtory of her Father, which will not be unuſefull for the intelligence of hers. <hi>Axiamira</hi> conſenting to it cauſed <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixana</hi> to ſit down by her, and <hi>Halima</hi> began to ſpeak in theſe terms.</p>

Now to ſhew you that ſhe hath dravvn this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her Father, who brought her up, and confirmed her in the opinion, that greatneſs was the ſoveraign good of this life; and that to attain unto it, vertue and honor were to be deſpiſed. You are to know, that in times paſt <hi>Roxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanaes</hi> Father was in reaſonable good favour with the Emperor <hi>Selim,</hi> Father to <hi>Soliman;</hi> and that after the death of <hi>Selim, Soliman</hi> alſo had a great care of his fortune: And certainly he had rendred him one of the moſt conſiderable of this Empire, had he had as much fidelity for his Maſter, as he had addreſs for to pleaſe him, cunning to conſerve himſelf, and diſſimulation to conceal his vices from a Prince vvho never had any, and who was never carried to any violence, but by that of love. But withall it muſt be acknowledged, that this paſſion hath often perverted all his inclinations; or at leaſtwiſe hath forced him to do things quite contrary to the ſenſe of his ſoul, when as it is peaceable. But to come again to <hi>Bajazet</hi> (ſo was the Father of <hi>Roxelana</hi> called) after he had by an hundred ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, which would be too long to recite, arrived at that height about <hi>Soliman,</hi> which I have told you; and that there was not any charge whereunto he might not have raiſed his hopes: It hapned for his ill fortune, that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſent him to carry his directions to <hi>Scutary,</hi> vvhere the <hi>Beglierbei</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> who vvas there at that time, committed to his conduct the faireſt Slave that ever was ſeen, for to preſent her in his name to the Sultan, to the end that if he adjudged her

Bajazet</hi> accepted of this imployment with joy, without any other deſign at that time, than to do a thing which he thought would not be diſagreeable to <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was then in the prime flower of his age, and one of the goodlieſt Princes of the world. But when the day of his departure was come, and that the <hi>Beglierbei</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi> had put the Slave into his hands, who, according to the cuſtom of thoſe which are to be preſented to the grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, was moſt gorgeouſly ſet forth, he was ſo mightily taken with the ſparkling of her eys, as if the <hi>Beglierbei,</hi> who was named <hi>Amurath,</hi> had noted his carriage, he might wel have known that he was too ſenſible of the attracts of beauty, to be made the conductor of a ſlave, that was able to ſubject the whole world; for as I have heard ſay, ſhe was as fair as <hi>Roxelana,</hi> whom I have ſometimes ſeen on the terrace of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> which looks on the Sea, where ordinarily ſhe is, when publike rejoycings are celebrated. But certes it muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>Soliman</hi> is excuſable for loving her, maugre her artifices, for indeed ſhe is the greateſt beauty that imagination it ſelf is able to conceive. This Slave, of whom I ſpeak, being then as fair as I deſcribe her to you, and being remitted unto the conduct of <hi>Bajazet</hi> for ſo long a journey, he became ſo deſperately in love with her, as notwithſtanding the reſpect which he owed to <hi>Soliman,</hi> and without fear of the chaſtiſements of an offended Prince, he reſolved to poſſeſs her, and not to render her unto him; howbeit he reſiſted ſo dangerous a temptation for ſome time; but his wit, that was but too fertile in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, having furniſhed himſelf with one, which he believed was good enough to make his deſign ſucceed without danger, he thought of nothing els but of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting it; and behold the way which he took to bring himſelf to it. This Slave deſtined to the grand Signior, had been ſold to <hi>Amurath,</hi> the <hi>Beglierbei</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> a little before <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s arrivall, by certain Pirats, who not ſo much as knew of whence ſhe was, though by her pronunciation it was gathered that ſhe was of <hi>Perſia:</hi> but whereas her language was not underſtood of any one, and that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo how ſhe underſtood nothing that was ſaid to her, he judged that ſhe knew not they were carrying her to the grand Signior. So that uſing her with a great deal of kindneſs during all the voyage, and teſtyfying much affection unto her, ſhe ſeemed to be comforted in her miſery, at leaſtwiſe ſhe ſhewed a more quiet countenance. He took exceeding care then, that ſhe might not underſtand by ſigns, that which ſhe could not underſtand otherways; and whereas he had been ſent upon a ſecret expedition, he was but little accompanied, which ſerved very much too for the furthering of his deſign. When as they approached to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he took his meaſures ſo right, that arriving too late, he ſeemed to be conſtrained to lie at an houſe that he had ſome four or five miles from the City, where out of jealouſie he had cauſed a young woman to be kept, whom he had exceedingly loved; but indeed his intent was, not to enter into <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for a ſecret reaſon which I am going to acquaint you with. He arrived then at this Countrey-houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in none lived but that woman, an old Eunuch that looked to her, and two ſlaves that waited on her, all his retinue being at his houſe in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the permiſſion of our Religion he had alſo two wives, with whom the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious <hi>Alicola</hi> (ſo was ſhe named that abode thus in the Country) could never agree. She was beautifull, and of a great ſpirit, but had ſuch a diſdainfull look, and ſo ambitious an inclination, that there was need of <hi>Bajazets</hi> humour for one to have had any love for her. This conformity which was between them did not for all that produce a reciprocall affection; for howſoever he had endeavoured to make himſelf be beloved of her for the ſpace of a year and more that ſhe had been in his hands, yet could he never do it: whether it were that ſhe had a naturall averſion for him, or that having found two other wives already in his houſe, which had all the authority over it, ſhe could not indure to be the laſt; ſo it was, that ſhe could not love him. She was a Perſian by Nation, and by what adventure ſhe came into <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s hands I am not able to ſay; but it ſufficeth to let you underſtand, for the intelligence of the Hiſtory which I am recounting, that ſhe was a Perſian, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60144:111"/> that as often as he ſpake to her of his affection, ſhe uſed to tell him, that when he was grand Viſier ſhe would promiſe him her good will: And her pride was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, as he had been conſtrained to ſeparate her from his other wives, being alſo jealous of her, as I have already declared. Knowing then her ambitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and the love of the fair Slave having almoſt extinguiſhed that, which <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaes</hi> rigor had much diminiſhed before; after he had conducted this ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chamber, and given the old Eunuch order to have a care of her, he entred into that of <hi>Alicola,</hi> who received him after the accuſtomed manner, that is to ſay, with a great deal of coldneſs. And whereas he thought that he ſhould ſurprize her with that which he purpoſed to ſay unto her, he muſed a little before he ſpake; but ſhe without loſing of time demanded of him, how long ſhe ſhould continue a priſoner? whether he was reſolved that ſhe ſhould alwayes live ſeparated from the commerce of the world? and that ſhe ſhould have no other entertainment but the view of a garden, and the noiſe of a fountain, whilſt his other women, which were not worthy to be his Slaves, enjoyed all the pleaſures of <hi>Conſtantinople? Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jezet</hi> finding this occaſion ſo favourable, would not loſe it; ſo that as ſoon as ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Heaven is my witneſs, fair <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi> ſaid he unto her, that the diſcourſe which I am going to make you, is rather an effect of deſpair, whereunto your rigor hath reduced me, than of any new paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſeeing it is certain, that if by a coldneſs, which had never example, you had not extinguiſhed the fire that your eys had kindled in my ſoul, I had never been ſenſible of love but for you only; and I ſhould never have been capable of ſeeking to cure my ſelf with an infidelity to <hi>Soliman,</hi> nor of changing of affection, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of yours. <hi>Alicola</hi> believing that <hi>Bajazets</hi> diſcourſe was but an artifice, to try if he could take her with jeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſie, quickly interrupted him. Have I not told you above an hundred times (replyed ſhe) that love can never touch me without ambition? If you were a King, I ſhould be jealous of your glory, and of your Crown; but of your perſon, in the eſtate wherein it is, I ſhould never he: Think not then that I do give you markes of my love, in giving you any of my jealouſie; love as long as you pleaſe, and whom you pleaſe, I will not appoſe it; for in fine, my heart cannot be touched but with magnificence and ſplendor, and not with tears and ſighes. If you will give me leave to ſpeak to you, anſwered <hi>Bajazet,</hi> I will let you know, that I have a mean to ſatisfie both your ambition, and mine; and it is ſo facile, that it depends on your will alone to be a <hi>Sultana,</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me one of the chiefeſt of this Empire, and one of the happieſt men of the world, by putting me in poſſeſſion of a perſon that is infinitely dear to me. This diſcourſe is ſo intricate (anſwered <hi>Alicola</hi>) that if you do not explain your ſelf better, I ſhall not be able to tell you what my will is; but in concluſion I aſſure you, that if ſo unlikely a thing ſhould depend on it, I would ſoon get out of your hands, and would chuſe rather to ſatisfie your ambition, than your love; for if I were in a condition to make your fortune, mine without doubt would be at the point I would have it, and it may be as I deſerve, that is to ſay extremely great. <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who would not diſpleaſe her, proteſted once again, that if he had believed he could have moved her with time, he would never have been carried to that which he was propounding unto her: whereupon he related unto her, how <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> had truſted him with a Perſian Slave, which he deſtined to the grand Signior; how the remembrance of her rigor had made him ſenſible of the attracts of her beauty; and at laſt ſaid unto her, whereas you are no leſs beautifull than ſhe; are alſo as young; are known of few; have the ſame coloured hair; and of a like ſtature; I will preſent you to the <hi>Sultan</hi> in ſtead of her, who queſtionleſs will be taken with that inevitable charm, which I ſo cruelly have tryed; And in this ſort will your ambition be ſatisfied, as likewiſe my new paſſion; and if you be generous, you will in that eſtate remember, how I am born with this conformity of my humor to yours, to believe that one may do any thing to become great. Let that oblige you then for your own glory to take care of me; that a man, who hath loved you, may not be in a rank unworthy of that honor. <hi>Alicola</hi> muſed a pretty while, then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60144:112"/> with a more contented countenance; Is it in earneſt, ſaid ſhe to him, that you propounded this unto me, or is it to diſcover my thoughts? and when as <hi>Bajazet</hi> had ſworn unto her, that he ſpake with ſincerity; ſhe ſaid unto him in a more cheerfull manner, at length you are come to that paſs, as to be agrerable unto me once in your life. But before you rejoyce me further, tell me, I pray you (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe) what will he ſay, that gave you this Slave to preſent her to the grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, when he ſhall know that you have retained her? He ſhall not know it, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and I mean to carry this deſign with ſo much addreſs, that no body ſhall ever diſcover it. The Eunuch, and the Slaves, which ſerve you, have teſtified their fidelity to me in other countries; and for thoſe which are come with me from <hi>Natolia,</hi> they cannot ſo much as ſuſpect that you are not the Slave whom they have accompanied. For you are not ignorant, that aſſoon as one is deſtined to the grand Signior, ſhe is treated with a high reſpect, and hath a veil caſt over her face, which ſhe never takes off but when ſhe is alone; ſo that according to this order, they will not wonder to ſee you goe out in the ſame ſort; and whereas I purpoſe to have you wear the ſame habit which <hi>Amurath</hi> gave to that Slave, they will doubtleſs take you for her. And for language, you need not but ſeem as though you did not underſtand ours, and make uſe of your naturall tongue, which is the ſame this Slaves is. It was in this faſhion that <hi>Bajazet</hi> made an end of confirming <hi>Alicola</hi> in the hope of her good fortune. And to ſay truth, it muſt be acknowledged that this deſign was not ill imagined; for he was very ſure that <hi>Alicola</hi> was not known at all to the great men of the Port, ſo that if it ſhould happen that any one of them ſhould be preſent with <hi>Soliman,</hi> when he ſhould preſent her unto him, that would not diſcover him: Neither was he ignorant, that thoſe which give Slaves to the grand Signior, never ſee them again after they are once entred into the Seraglio, ſo that if <hi>Amurath</hi> ſhould chance to return unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> within eight daies after, he could not find out the truth; ſince the grand Signior thanking him for his fair Slave, would not deſcribe her unto him. But hear the ſucceſs of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; The reſolution which I have told you of, being taken, <hi>Bajazet</hi> calles his old Eunuch; recommends fidelity and ſilence unto him; and after he had charged him never to ſpeak of the change which he was going to ſee, he bids him preſent <hi>Alicoles</hi> richeſt habit to the fair Slave, with all her jewells, thereby to oblige her to part with that which ſhe had brought from <hi>Natolia,</hi> giving her to underſtand by ſignes, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> would pray her to wear that which he then gave her the next day. The matter was executed as he deſired, the Eunuch performes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and as ſoon as the day begins to break, <hi>Alicola</hi> attired herſelf with care in the fair Slaves roab, forgot nothing of what ſhe thought would be advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to her; and covering her face with a very thick vail, vvhich reached dovvn to her vvaſt, ſhe ſuffred not her ſelf to be ſeen again, till ſhe came before the grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior. In the mean time <hi>Bajazet,</hi> before he parted, goes to the fair Slaves chamber, labours to make her underſtand, that he will ſee her again ſhortly, and that in the mean ſpace, ſhe may command all things there: He calls the Slaves which ſerved <hi>Alicola,</hi> charges them to have the ſame care of the perſon whom he leaves in their hands, as they had had of her whom he carries away, and never to diſcover that which they had ſeen. He adds promiſes of recompence to his command, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of puniſhment, if they were ſo inconſiderate as to reveal the ſecret wherewith they were truſted. After this he cauſeth <hi>Alicola</hi> to mount into his chariot, where for the more reſpect he leaves her alone, and followes her on horſeback, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by thoſe which had made the voyage of <hi>Natolia</hi> with him, who never perceived but that it was the Salve, for as I have already declared, ſeeing her of the ſame ſtature, with the ſame clothes, and her face being covered, they could obſerve no difference. In this manner <hi>Bajazet</hi> arrives at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> goes directly to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> and with a daringneſs which is incomprehenſible to me, gives the <hi>Sultan</hi> to underſtand, that he was there waiting to preſent a Slave unto him from <hi>Amurath, Beglierbei</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> and to give him an account alſo of the voyage he had made by his order. <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was then in an age, wherein ſuch a like newes brought him

She beholds him then with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, indeavours much to incounter his eyes; and whereas ſhe had an haughty and proud look, ſhe ſeemed to be rather a victorious <hi>Amazon,</hi> than an infortunate Slave. But behold here, great Princeſs, the caprichiouſneſs of fortune, who mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our prudence, makes it oftentimes ſerve for our ruine.

And when as this Prince gave over ſpeaking, to conſider her the better, ſhe imagined that this ſilence was already an effect of love. So that glorious of this conqueſt, and not able to retain all her joy in her heart, ſhe could not forbear looking on <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as it were to tell him that her victory was aſſured. This hope proved for all that but ill grounded, for though <hi>Alicola</hi> was fair, though ſhe was very young, and that <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was ſo too, this Prince, which could never be vanquiſhed, either in war, or in love, but onely by gentleneſs, felt not himſelf ſenſible of <hi>Alicolaes</hi> attracts. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders her, demands out of what country ſhe came into the hands of <hi>Amurath,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends her beauty, profeſſeth that few defects could be found in it, but at length for concluſion, he tells <hi>Bajazet,</hi> that ſtoutneſs did never pleaſe him but in war; and that there was ſomething in his heart which did ſo mightily reſiſt all the attracts of this Slave, as he could not be moved with her. <hi>Alicola,</hi> ſurpriſed with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, could not chooſe but ſtroke her hand over her eyes to aſſure her countenance. <hi>Bajazet</hi> on the other ſide, who had never thought that <hi>Soliman</hi> could have refuſed a fair woman, and that feared nothing ſo much as to ſee his deſign fail, was ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as he could hardly ſpeak. Howbeit he had a ſpirit, that left him not long in unquietneſs; ſo that ſtriving with himſelf, after he had anſwered to all the queſtions which <hi>Soliman</hi> had asked him, he aſſured him that the journey had made this Slave loſe ſomething of her beauty, and that if it pleaſed his Highneſs to ſee her again a few days after, it may be he would be better ſatisfied of her. Never a whit, replyed <hi>Soliman,</hi> who thinking that <hi>Alicola</hi> underſtood not what he ſaid, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed none of his thoughts. But, continued <hi>Bajazet,</hi> may I dare, without loſing the reſpect which I ow to thy Highneſs, demand of thee what I ſhall write to <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> to let him know what the defects of her are whom he had choſen for thee?

I leave you to imagine what anguiſh the ambitious <hi>Alicola</hi> was in, it was ſuch, as forgetting all things, ſhe purpoſed twice or thrice to have ſpoken; and had ſhe not been retained by the thought, that her undoing would have been annexed to that of <hi>Bajazets,</hi> if ſhe diſcovered the trick which they played <hi>Soliman,</hi> it is certain that ſhe had given ſome marks of her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And to make an end of enraging her, and <hi>Bajazet</hi> too, the grand Signior told him, that to doe an act of juſtice in this incounter, he would put him in poſſeſſion of <hi>Alicola,</hi> willing him to hold this preſent dear; for, continued he, in this ſort I teſtifie the eſteem I make of <hi>Amuraths</hi> liberality; I recompence the care which thou haſt taken in conducting this fair Slave to me; and I render her as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

How much <hi>Bajazet</hi> was afflicted with this diſcourſe you may eaſily conceive, but though this adventure grieved him extremely, yet was it nothing in compariſon of <hi>Alicolaes</hi> rage, who by the changing of her colour ſhewed but too much, that ſhe had underſtood what the grand Signior had ſayd, if he had marked it. <hi>Bajazet</hi> having perceived her unquietneſs, being dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, caſt himſelf at his feet to keep him from ſeeing her, under pretence of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him thanks, and teſtified a great deal of joy for a thing that troubled him exceedingly. But fearing that in the end <hi>Alicolaes</hi> grief would break forth, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew as ſoon as poſsibly he could. Scarcely vvas he out of the Sultans chamber, but ſhe would have begun to cry out, and give ſome marks of her choler. He ſpeaks very gently to her, repreſents to her, that ſhe would undo her ſelf as well as him, if by her imprudence ſhe ſhould give any notice of their impoſture.

As long as the journey laſted ſhe was conſtrained to hold her peace, becauſe <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who foreſaw that ſhe would ſay ſtrange things unto him, rode thirty or forty paces behind her; but when ſhe was arrived at her chamber, and that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had followed her, with an intent to pacifie her, what did ſhe not ſay againſt him! againſt the fair Slave! and againſt <hi>Solim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> I might vvell think (ſayd ſhe beholding him with contempt) that a Prince unjuſt enough to love thee, would be yet more not to love me; but I take heaven to witneſs, that I will ceaſe to be <hi>Alicola,</hi> or I will be revenged either on him, or on thee that is ſo dear to him. <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſeeing her in this fury, did what he could to appeaſe her; made as though he had an affection ſtill to her, and would have perſwaded her, ſeeing Heaven would not let her ambition be ſatisfied, to live better with him for the future, than formerly ſhe had done. But ſhe, that was not in an eſtate to be vvrought upon, anſwered him with ſo much pride and inſolence, as judging it not ſafe for him to leave her at liberty in his houſe, he quitted her in choler, and commanded his old Eunuch to ſhut her up, and not to let her go out of her chamber, what crying or violence ſoever ſhe ſhould uſe. This order given, he went to ſee the fair Slave, whom the Jewels which he had cauſed to be preſented unto her, had rendred more tractable. The kind entertainment which ſhe gave him was a comfort to him againſt all <hi>Alicolaes</hi> fury; and comming at laſt to conſider, that in the manner as the matter had fallen out, he might poſſeſſe this ſlave without concealing her, as he had purpoſed to have done; and that <hi>Amurath</hi> returning, he might alſo ſee her in his hand without offence, ſince he could ſay, that the grand Signior h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But to abridge this diſcourſe as much as poſſible I may, you ſhall underſtand, that <hi>Bajazets</hi> ſubmiſſions put him quickly in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the fair Slave, whom he took to Wife according to our ceremonies; and that his impoſture gave him a year of felicity: For though it vexed him to be conſtrained to keep <hi>Alicola</hi> ſhut up for fear ſhe ſhould diſcover him, yet was it but a light unquietneſs in compariſon of the pleaſure which he enjoyed in the poſſeſſion of the fair Slave; who almoſt as ſoon as ſhe was his Wife, became with child, which was no little joy to him, for that he had had no children before. Behold him then the happieſt of men, according to his opinion, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be no longer in fear. But he knew not that Tygers chayned are alwaies dangerous, and that one can never be ſo well ſecured of them, either with chains or grates, but that they are ſtill to be feared. As things were in this eſtate, <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> was recalled to the Port by the grand Signior, who ſeeing him, excuſed the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60144:113"/> beſtowing of his Slave on <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and told him ſome of the reaſons, which laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had willed ſhould be written unto him: now though <hi>Amurath</hi> had not found any ſuch haughty look in the Slave which he had ſent, yet did he not for all that ſuſpect <hi>Bajazet</hi> of deceiving him. Some days after his return he inquires after him, and learns that he is ſeldom at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but when the neceſſity of his attendance upon <hi>Soliman</hi> required it; and that the love of a Slave, which the grand Signior had given him about a year before, poſſeſſed him in ſuch fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But as ſoon as <hi>Alicola</hi> had caſt out her note, ſhe let down the grate, ſo as he could but only perceive that it was a woman that had ſhut it. He imagined thereupon that this peradventure was the fair Slave which wrote unto him, and that ſhe deſired to get out of <hi>Bajazets</hi> hands; in which thought he ſpeedily took up the paper, and being about to open it, he ſaw written upon the outſide,

According to the reſolution they had taken then, ſhe pulled up her vail, and ſaid unto him, that ſhe remembred well he had redeemed her from the Pirates; that ſhe owed all her felicity to him; and that although ſhe held her ſelf the hapieſt creature in the world, yet was ſhe grieved for his ſake, that her defects had kept her from being agreeable to the grand Signior. This woman ſpoke thus with an apparent ſincerity, ſo well counterfeited, as it had been hard not to have been deceived with it. And that which rendred her ſo dextrous vvas, for that ſhe really loved <hi>Bajazet,</hi> vvho on his part made an hundred complements to <hi>Amurath,</hi> aſſuring him that he vvas more obliged to him, than to <hi>Soliman,</hi> for the poſſeſſion of a perſon vvhich vvas infinitely dear to him; ſince if he had not had the goodneſs to confide in him, by giving him the conduct of this Slave, he had never been maſter of the happineſs which now he injoyed. <hi>Amurath</hi> anſwered to all theſe civilities with more liberty of mind, than he could have done, if he had not ſeen the fair Slave: For finding her ſomewhat altered, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her ſickneſs and being with child, his renewing flames extinguiſhed in a moment, and tranquility re-eſtabliſhed it ſelf in his ſoul.

But as he knew, that one and the ſame thing is diverſly judged of by the moſt part of the world, ſo he made no great reflexion thereupon; and the ſole unquietneſs about the note which had been caſt him, could then trouble him. And whereas he had no more to do in that place, ſeeing the fair Slave touched his heart no longer, he ſhortned his viſit, and after he had been two houres in the hall, talking of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which had brought him back to the Port, he took leave of the fair Slave; for as for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whereas he had purpoſed to return that day to the City, he thought he ſhould be uncivill in not going along with <hi>Amurath,</hi> who did his uttermoſt to keep him from it; judging rightly that if they went together, he ſhould not read his note till he came to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but at length he was fain to give way to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazets</hi> importunate civility.

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Alicola</hi> was not gone from it, ſhe changed her firſt reſolution, lifted up the grate, and ſhewing her ſelf openly, ſhe joyned the charmes of her beauty to her requeſts; for if you have obſerved it, all our houſes are ſo low, that ſhe was not far diſtant from him. After ſhe had let her ſelf been ſeen a while, ſhe ſaluted <hi>Amurath</hi> after the faſhion of the Country; and with a ſuppliant behaviour ſeemed to demand ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of him in ſome misfortune that was befallen her. <hi>Amurath</hi> finding her very beautifull, made ſign to her, that he would do what ſhe would have him, not being able for all that to comprehend ought in this adventure. But at laſt <hi>Bajazet</hi> came, and going away together, they arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> juſt as it was night. <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> waited on <hi>Amurath</hi> home, where having left him, he gave him the liberty to ſatisfie his impatience.

Withall, he had obſerved, in the little time that he had ſeen <hi>Alicola</hi> at the window, how ſhe had a proud and haughty look, ſo that this might be ſhe whom <hi>Soliman</hi> had refuſed, as ſhe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her note.

The firſt thought that came into his mind was, that <hi>Amurath</hi> was become inamoured of the fair Slave, and that he would take her away by force.

Now though he was more diligent than <hi>Amurath,</hi> and that by a nearer and a by-way he arrived there a little before him, yet could he not execute all that he thought to have done; for <hi>Amurath,</hi> who had not ſtayed for his chariot, was gone away with twelve armed men, ſo that he arrived at <hi>Bajazets</hi> houſe, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after he was entred into the fair Slaves chamber, whom he found ſtill in her bed: ſo that preſſing her to make her ſelf ready with all ſpeed, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But he was very much ſurpriſed, when as his Eunuch came and told him that <hi>Amurath,</hi> who knew not that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was there, required to enter in the behalf of the grand Signior; that he eſpyed through a chink of the door that he was accompanied with armed men; and that to have meanes to advertiſe him of it, he had told him that he went to fetch the k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60144:115"/> and the better to amuſe <hi>Amurath</hi> if he ſhould follow them, they ſhut both the gate of the garden, and that of the meadow after them. On the other ſide, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> who would attend no longer, cauſed the outward gate to be broken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; and ſcarcely had <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſhut that of the Garden, when as he was in the houſe. Never was there a greater diſorder ſeen; the fair Slave was all in tears, and fearing ſhe ſhould not be able to go, by reaſon of her great belly and her indiſpoſition, ſhe beſought <hi>Bajazet</hi> to abandon her, and to think of nothing but ſaving himſelf. But unwilling ſo to do, he laboured to give her ſome hope, and to go as faſt as ſhe could, untill they might get up both on a horſe, which the ſlave that vvas faithfull unto him, was bringing them. In the mean time <hi>Alicola</hi> cryed out that they would murther her, to the end that <hi>Amurath</hi> hearing her cryes, might the quicklier enter into the houſe, and more eaſily follow them that were fled. But at laſt <hi>Amurath</hi> being got in, and <hi>Alicola</hi> having opened him her chamber door, acquainted him, how from her window that opened upon the Garden, ſhe had ſeen <hi>Bajazet</hi> eſcape out of a back-gate; and that it were good he ſhould be purſued with all ſpeed. <hi>Amurath</hi> preſently enjoyns ſome of his men to do ſo; and charges them, if they met with him, not to kill him, howſoever he defended himſelf. They do as they are commanded, but finding the gates ſhut, they were a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could break them open; ſo that when they were without any obſtacle, they were not in caſe ſo eaſily to find that which they ſought for. They ſeparated themſelves, out of the hope to meet with him the ſooner, and omitted nothing of whatſoever they beleeved might be of uſe for this ſearch. Two of them indeed incountred the ſlave which had followed them, and that was reſolved not to re-enter into her Maſters houſe; howbeit ſhe ſerved but to turn them out of the way, which undoubtedly had brought them to thoſe fugitives. For not knowing that ſhe belonged to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> they asked of her if ſhe had not ſeen a man carrying away a woman? She nothing daunted told them, that they had paſt by her a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that leaving the ordinary road they had taken on the right hand over the fields. This ſlave ſaid thus unto them in ſuch an ingenuous manner, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved her; ſo that abandoning a way which would have made them incounter what they ſought for, they took another which led them far from it. After ſo vain a labor, ſeeing the night approach, without having any hope to perform that which had been commanded them, they returned to <hi>Amurath,</hi> who in giving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the ambitious <hi>Alicola,</hi> was conſtrained to loſe his own, ſuch power had the charms of this woman over his ſoul. For whereas ſhe had remembred how diſadvantageous her proud humour had been to her, at ſuch time as ſhe appeared before <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſhe conſtrained her inclination, and adding artifice to her beauty, ſhe was ſo pleaſing to <hi>Amurath,</hi> as he could not reſiſt her. She related to him at length all that ſhe had written to him in brief, and calling him her Deliverer, with her eyes full of tears, ſhe aggravated all the rigors which <hi>Bajazet</hi> had uſed towards her, after that the fair Slave was in his hands. She was carefull to let him know, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> could never ſurmount her, either with ſubmiſſions or menaces; and caſting her ſelf at <hi>Amuraths</hi> feet, to implore his protection to <hi>Soliman,</hi> leſt he ſhould puniſh her for being an actor in the ſuppoſition that was made him, ſhe moved his heart to pitty; and he himſelf beleeving that this was nothing but compaſſion, found it afterwards to be love. But at laſt <hi>Amurath</hi> ſeeing by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his people that he had no more to do in that place, and that his Chariot was arrived a good while before, he placed <hi>Alicola</hi> in it, together with the ſlave that had been faithfull unto her; and though it was exceeding late, yet they ſet forth on their way towards <hi>Conſtantinople. Amurath</hi> cauſed alſo the old Eunch to be brought along, that he might be made to confirm <hi>Alicolaes</hi> diſcourſe. When they had marched a pretty while, the night ſurpriſed them, which was ſo obſcure and dark (for neither Moon nor ſtarres were to be ſeen) as he that drove the chariot, having never been at this place before, loſt his way in ſuch ſort, as after he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled half the night in hope to find it again, he was conſtrained to ſend one to his Maſter to advertiſe him of the fault he had committed. <hi>Amurath</hi> ſeeing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot

In this uncertainty, he ſent two of his men to ſee if they could finde out any houſes, either to lodge there, or to learn of them what courſe they ſhould hold: but theſe tvvo having loſt their vvay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, after they had found that they ſought for, could not recover the place vvhere they had left the Chariot. In the mean time, <hi>Amurath</hi> having no nevvs of thoſe he had ſent, and not knovving vvhat to do in ſo croſs an accident, reſolved to ſtay the day break, or the return of his men, before he vvould go on, fearing he ſhould vvander ſtill further, and fall into ſome precipice. This reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken, he Marſhalled all his men round about his Chariot, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing forth ſome Centinells, he commanded them not to ſpeak, nor to make any noiſe, that they might the more eaſily hear any that came to them. This order given, he placed himſelf neer to the Chariot, with his Scymitar out of the Scabbard, to the end he might not be ſurprized if any body ſhould aſſault him; craving pardon of <hi>Alicola</hi> for the incommodity ſhe received. They had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paſt the whole night in this unpleaſing ſtay, and the break of day began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to whiten the clouds a little on the Sun-riſing ſide, when they heard the trampling of an horſe, and ſuddenly after the cry and fall of a woman. <hi>Amurath</hi> being inſtantly advertiſed thereof, thought it might be the fair Slave; they went then afoot to that part where they had heard this voyce, with as little noiſe as poſſibly they could make; it was not long before they heard a man ſpeak, without diſtinctly underſtanding what he ſaid. But at length approaching neerer to them, they heard how that woman conjured him to abandon her, and to think of nothing but his own ſafety; how he ſaw well that it was heavens pleaſure ſhe ſhould be caſt away, and that it was impoſſible for him to ſave her. At the ſame inſtant that mans horſe having got looſe came amongſt thoſe of the Chariot, who thereupon made ſo great a noiſe, that <hi>Amurath,</hi> who thought it was not fit to give <hi>Bajazet</hi> (whom he knew by his voice) any leaſure to put himſelf in defence, advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all to that place where he had heard him ſpeak; but he had not gone far, before he found the fair Slave at his feet, though he could not well diſcern her in regard it was not yet light enough for it; <hi>Bajazet</hi> did what he could to reſiſt them that preſt him to yeeld himſelf: And whereas he knew not certainly whether theſe were <hi>Amaraths</hi> men or no, he told them that they did not know him, and that aſſuredly they were miſtaken.

Behold him then in the power of his enemie, as well as the fair Slave: for thinking to do the beſt for their ſafety, they had hid themſelves moſt part of the day in a wood, with a reſolution to travell all night; but their horſe chancing to ſtumble, the fair Slave fell, as I have declared, and by her crying out diſcovered where ſhe was. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> ſeeing how lucky the loſing of his way had proved unto him, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be light enough to diſcern where they were, found he was not ſo far from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as he thought he had been, ſo that conſidering how he might beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his priſoners to the City, he deſired <hi>Alicola</hi> that ſhe would make the reſt of the journey on horſe-back, to the end he might for his own ſecuritie put <hi>Bajazet</hi> and the fair Slave into the Chariot.

                     <hi>Bajazet</hi> to enter into the Chariot, and the fair Slave with him, whoſe fall had brought her more fear than hurt, for ſhe had but a little bruiſe upon one of her arms. <hi>Alicola</hi> mounted then on a horſe, and her ſlave on another; all <hi>Amuraths</hi> people marched on both ſides of the Chariot, and he with <hi>Alicola</hi> rode four or five paces behind, as it were leading the priſoners, whom he conducted in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. They arrived in this ſort at the gates of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where having made <hi>Alicola</hi> alight, he ſent her, together vvith <hi>Bajazet</hi> and the fair Slave to his Palace, and there after he had cauſed them to eat, he went to give <hi>Soliman</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of hir voyage. As ſoon as the <hi>Sultan</hi> was advertiſed of the ſtate of things, he commanded theſe offendors to be brought before him, which immediately was executed. You may immagine the ſeverall apprehenſions that all of them had: <hi>Bajazet</hi> was in a great deal of confuſion to appear before his Maſter whom he had betrayed; before a friend whom he had deceived; before a woman whom he had loved, and that was going to convince him of perfidiouſneſs; but that which moſt afflicted him was the grief of the fair Slave. <hi>Alicola</hi> was exceedingly vexed to appear before a Prince that had deſpiſed her; yet did ſhe comfort her ſelf vvith the thought that ſhe deprived him of a man whom he loved. <hi>Amurath</hi> had his heart filled with his new flames, which made him to be not without unquietneſs; for he feared that <hi>Soliman</hi> puniſhing <hi>Bajazet</hi> would alſo puniſh <hi>Alicola,</hi> ſince ſhe had helped to deceive him. As for the fair Slave, the fear alone of loſing <hi>Bajazet</hi> made her ſhed tears: But at length, they arrived all before <hi>Soliman.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as none of them durſt ſo much as lift up their eys, it was the Sultans pleaſure they ſhould ſpeak ſeparately; and firſt he commanded <hi>Bajazet</hi> to render an account of his doings. Whereupon falling down on his knees, he ſpake much after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for I think that I have heard him repeat it over above an hundred times. As love only hath been the cauſe of my crime, ſo love only muſt alſo be my defence; for, my Lord (ſaid he unto him) I know but too well, that reaſon and juſtice are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely againſt me. I have contemned the counſell of the firſt, and I have not been afraid of the ſecond; I have betrayed a Prince, who is not only my lawfull Prince; who is not only the greateſt Prince of the World; but who, for the greater ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating of my fault, is a Prince which hath alwaies loved me, and whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath been ſo great towards me, as it hath ſcarce ſet any bounds to my hopes. Now if after ſo great a crime, it is requiſite to conſider the reſt which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I have betrayed a man that confided in me; I have abandoned a woman whom I had loved long, and have made her pay very dearly for the teſtimonies of my affection, with unheard-of rigour; and to ſay all, I have abuſed the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of a Slave which was deſtined to thee, and depriving her by my artifices of the honour of being thine, I have wronged her more than all the reſt. In fine, my Lord, which way ſoever I turn me, I ſee the marks of my crime; but if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it would pleaſe thy Highneſs to conſider by what violence my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath been forced to carry me to ſuch ſtrange things, thou wouldſt doubtleſs have ſome pitty of my misfortune. For if it be true that we have ſome compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man whoſe imagination hath been troubled with melancholy, why ſhall we not have it of a man whom love hath bereaved of his underſtanding? What imports it whether the cauſe of his folly be interior, or whether it proceeds from without? ſo it is, that I have not failed, till love had ſeduced my reaſon; till I had loſt my judgement, till my will was no longer in mine own power; till all my deſires perſwaded me to the crime which I have committed; till all my ſenſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me, till occaſion favored my deſign; and till nothing appoſing my felicity, I had not ſtrength enough to deſpiſe it, as I was obliged to doe, ſeeing I could not enjoy it without being the moſt faulty of all men. In concluſion, if thy goodneſs will permit it, all my crimes ſhall be compriſed in one alone word, I have loved. I doe not for all that refuſe the chaſtiſement which I merit, and to that end I lay my head at thy feet. <hi>Bajazet</hi> had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but <hi>Alicola</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Soliman</hi> with a bold and firme voyce; as for me, the crime which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted is of ſuch a nature, as I can never repent me of it, and the onely grief I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60144:116"/> have left me is, that I have committed a crime to no purpoſe. I know that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the honor to be thy Slave, I wiſhed for a good which I was unworthy of, but I hoped that if my beauty was not able to touch thy Highneſs powerfully, yet the greatneſs of my ſoul might pleaſe thee; and I attended from mine eyes, but this onely advantage to be received into the number of thy Slaves, remitting my good fortune to the knowledge, which time ſhould have given thee of the thoughts of my heart. Finally, my Lord, I was ſhewed a way, which might have led me to glory; I followed it, and would follow it ſtill, had I new meanes preſented me to doe it. But if nevertheleſſe ſo noble a deſigne deſerves chaſtiſement, I may ſay, that the puniſhment which I have already received for it is greater than the evill I have done. I will not reckon up the rigors of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> for I am too generous to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his fault before a Prince, whom he hath but too much provoked; but I will only beſeech thy Highneſs to remember thoſe cruell words, and that bitter jeere, which thou uſedſt to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> when as thou didſt refuſe me: words which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but too well, though I made ſhew that I underſtood them not. And to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my ſelf alſo in thy preſence, I am but to call to minde, how thou ſaidſt that I was fitter to conduct <hi>Amazons</hi> to the warrs, than to live in a Seraglio; that I looked more like a Soldier, than a woman; that thou fearedſt my valour would equall thine; that when as thou wouldeſt give me markes of thy affection, I would render thee ſome of my courage; and at laſt that I was more capeable of making priſoners of warre, than priſoners of love. Ah, my Lord, if thou kneweſt what a puniſhment that is, which a vvoman doth reſent, that is of an high ſpirit, and thinkes her ſelf faire, vvhen ſhe heares ſuch like things ſpoken of her, thy Highneſs vvould not be troubled hovv to chaſtiſe me, ſeeing it is certaine that I carry a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor about me in my memory, vvhich follovves me every vvhere, and vvill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me eternally. Hovvſoever I am moſt ready to obey thy Highneſs, and to die, that thou mayeſt be revenged of me, ſince I cannot live to be thine. Herevvith <hi>Alicola</hi> made an end of her ſpeech, and the faire ſlave began hers; and though ſhe ſpake not one language perfectly, yet vvas not her diſcourſe the leaſt couching. The reſt (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Soliman</hi>) have laboured to execuſe their crimes to thy Highneſs, but for me, vvho may not black mine innocency voluntarily, ſince I cannot partake vvith <hi>Bajazet</hi> in his crime, <hi>I</hi> muſt at leaſt vviſe partake vvith him in his misfortune. I muſt (I ſay) indeavour to make mine innocency appeare, only to obtaine pardon for his crime. But the miſery wherein I find my ſelf is ſo great, as I cannot think to ſave him this way, but in rendring him the more faulty. I muſt ſay then, my Lord, that when <hi>Amurath</hi> put me into his hands, I knew not that I was deſtined to thy Highneſs; he conducted me to his houſe, and retained me there without ever ſuffering me to underſtand ſo much; and having rendred me all the teſtimonies of love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which I could have deſired from a man that had not had me in his power, I acknowledge that his affection moved me; that I gave him mine; and that in the wretched condition, whereunto fortune hath reduced me, I eſteem my ſelf happy to be his wife, I acknowledge alſo, my Lord, that he hath confeſſed his crime unto me ſince; but whereas this crime was a teſtimony of the affection he bore me, and that our mariage had made me unworthy of being able to repair his fault, by reſtoring me into thy hands, would not thy Highneſs have blamed me for coming to accuſe my husband of a fault, which he hath not committed but out of an exceſs of love? After this, my Lord, I do not think thy Highneſs can doubt of mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie; and not doubting of it, I dare hope that thou wilt not puniſh me more cruelly than <hi>Bajazet,</hi> by letting me live, and putting him to death; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily thou will have the goodneſs to grant me his pardon. For, my Lord, what reaſon would there be, that I who am abſolutely innocent, ſhould have the ſame deſtiny that the guilty have? Is it not enough that fortune hath forcibly carried me from out of the armes of my parents, to put me into the hands of Pirats? that I have been ſold for a Slave; and to ſay all, that ſhe hath deprived me of the honor of being thine; but that by the order of the greateſt, and moſt equitable of Princes, I ſhould alſo be deprived of an husband, who is to me in ſtead of Parents, of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60144:117"/> country, of treaſures; and who in concluſion makes up all my felicity? Conſider, my Lord, in this occaſion, how his crime and mine innocence are linked ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as thou canſt not be juſt towards him, without being unjuſt towards me, and how the other way, thou maiſt be juſt towards me, and clement towards him. But to carry preſumption as far as it can goe, or to ſay better, the confidence which I have in thy goodneſs, I humbly beſeech thee again, that as it is I who have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the unhappy <hi>Alicola</hi> of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and that in conſideration of me ſhe hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch, ſo thou wilt likewiſe in conſideration of me pardon him. But if never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs thy Highneſs is otherwiſe reſolved, grant me at leaſtwiſe the grace that I may die with <hi>Baiazet.</hi> The fair Slave mollified the heart of <hi>Soliman;</hi> and as hee was about to have ſpoken, <hi>Amurath</hi> made haſt to ſay to him; I know very well that I am the accuſer of theſe offenders, and that in ſome ſort too I am a party with them; ſo that, my Lord, I am to be their defendor alſo in this occaſion, and doe moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech thy Highneſs to pardon them: It is an act worthy of <hi>Soliman</hi> not to be revenged on them that are in his power; and the true felicity of Kings is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt to make up that of their ſubjects. It will be long of none but thy ſelf then, if thou be not ſatisfied, in rendering us all four happy. For, my Lord, if thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the poſſeſſion of the fair Slave to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he will certainly eſteem himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as well as ſhe. As for me, my Lord, if the purpoſe which I had to tender thee a preſent, that I thought would be agreeable to thee, merits any recompence, as thy highneſs hath beene pleaſed to aſſure me, I beg the pardon and poſſeſſion of <hi>Alicola,</hi> who by what I have noted in her diſcourſe, is more ſenſible of ambition than love; ſo that injoying by thy bounty, a rank conſiderable enough about thee, ſhe will have means to be ſatisfied, and I too; ſeeing I am conſtrained to acknowledge, that my opinion is not like unto thine, for the beauty of <hi>Alicola;</hi> and that I have been a whole day the moſt amorous of all men. <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeeing him about to proceed, would not permit him, and reaching his hand to him ſmiling, I am glad (ſaid hee unto him) that we are not of the ſame opinion for beauty, ſince thereby I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſatisfie thee. And for thee, ſaid he to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> I remit the offence thou haſt committed againſt me; but know, that if Love combatted for thee in thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the goodwill which I have alwaies born thee hath far better defended thee in my heart. Then turning him to the fair Slave, he commended her generoſity, and the affection which ſhee carried to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> aſſuring her that he would never trouble her reſt. As for <hi>Alicola,</hi> he told her, that to render the conqueſt, which ſhe had obtained, more worthy of her, and more capable of contenting her, he would make <hi>Amurath</hi> grand viſier. After this he ſaid to <hi>Baiazet,</hi> hee was ſorry that for the preſervation of his authority, and for example ſake, hee could not let him live at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but in regard it was impoſſible the matter ſhould not be divulged by thoſe who had accompanied <hi>Amurath,</hi> he muſt needs reſolve to abſent himſelf from the Port, for fear leaſt this importunity ſhould give others the boldneſs to commit the like, or greater faults than this. That he did not condemn him to go out of the territories of his Dominion, but he would have him abide in one of the Iſlands of the <hi>Achipelago,</hi> and there lead a private and particular life. To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto you the joy of theſe four perſons, would be an impoſſible thing, however ſo it was, that after they had rendered a thouſand thanks to <hi>Soliman,</hi> and that he had made them all recount the ſeverall thoughts which they had had during the time wherein he had been deceived by them, they departed away. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> conducted <hi>Alicola</hi> home to his houſe, where he married her the next day, and <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Behold, Madam, how this matter paſſed; for my husband, who as you know is older than I, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it from <hi>Bajazets</hi> own mouth, whoſe friend hee had been a long time together. Have not you told me (ſaid <hi>Axiamira</hi>) that you knew all theſe things from a ſlave that was <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> favourite, whom ſhe afterwards turned away, and that hath ſerved you a great while? Yes indeed, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Halima,</hi> for ſo much as concerned <hi>Roxelana</hi> in particular; but whereas her Hiſtory depends on her father <hi>Bajazets,</hi> I was willing to recount it unto you: And you your ſelf will doubtleſs judge, that it was not unuſefull for the intelligence
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60144:117"/> of that which you deſire to know. You have very much obliged me, replyed <hi>Axiamira;</hi> for certainly this adventure deſerves to be known; but let us come, I pray you, to that which regards <hi>Roxelana</hi> in particular. I ſhall tell you then, ſaid <hi>Halima,</hi> that after <hi>Bajazet</hi> had well thought of the place that he was to goe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit in, he choſe the Town of <hi>Chio,</hi> which beares the name of the Iſland wherein it is built; it is ſituated in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and being only tributary to the Grand Signior, is certainly one of the moſt pleaſant Iſlands in the world, either for the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility thereof, for the ſweetneſs of the climate, for the beauty of the buildings, for the curteſie of thoſe that inhabit it, or for the liberty of converſation, which is greater in that place, than in all the reſt of this Empire. The cauſe of this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, for that this Iſland is inhabited by all ſorts of Nations, ſo that of the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their cuſtoms a perfect one is made which holds a little of all the reſt. It was in this bliſs-full abode then, whither <hi>Bajazet</hi> vvent to find out a refuge, after his baniſhment. I have told you he had two Wives at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but whereas he loved none but the fair Slave, he gave them a piece of mony, and reſtored them to their parents, according to the permiſſion of our Laws, and carryed along with him only the perſon whom he loved. He laded a veſſel then with his goods, and in the end arrived proſperouſly at the Iſle of <hi>Chio;</hi> where he was ſcarcely ſetled, when as the fair Slave was delivered of a daughter, whom afterwards he called <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and is the ſame whoſe adventures you deſire to know. <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as I have declared to you, was of an ambitious humor, ſo that after he had for a while led an idle life, and that a long poſſeſſion of the fair Slave had quenched all thoſe flames in his heart, ambition began to kindle hers again, and re-aſſumed her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer room in his ſoul. He termed the place of his retreat a priſon; he bore his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile unquietly; and calling to remembrance all the great hopes which he had had, he was troubled with a continuall remorſe for what he had done, and anguiſh of mind that never abandoned him; for the more he ſought how to re-eſtabliſh himſelf, the leſs likelyhood he ſaw for it. In the mean time the little <hi>Roxelana</hi> grevv up ſtill, and ſhee might bee about four yeares old, vvhen as <hi>Bajazet</hi> conſidering her upon a day, in the midſt of a great aſſembly, where every one admired her ſpringing beauty, and took pleaſure in beholding her; he heard one ask her what ſhe would moſt deſire in the world? ſhe ſtraight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered without ſticking at it, that it ſhould be to make her father rich and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. This was no ſooner ſpoken by her, but <hi>Bajazet</hi> comming as it were out of a dead ſleep, took a reſolution, which I will relate unto you. And conſider I pray you, how a weak beginning hath many times a long and dangerous conſequence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the little <hi>Roxelana</hi> was not more beautifull that day than at other times, hovvbeit her fathers anguiſh had been ſo great, as one would have thought he had never taken notice that ſhe was the faireſt and wittieſt child that ever had been ſeen; for as ſoon as he had opened his eyes, and that the acclamations which were given to <hi>Roxelana</hi> had made him perceive ſhe was a Maſter-piece of Nature, his heavineſs diminiſhed, and al his induſtry and care was no onger, but to endeavour to make her wit as dextrous as her beauty was charming. And truly it was not hard to bring her to what he deſired; for as ſhe had all the beauty of her mother, ſo had ſhe all the inclinations of her father. And whereas they are perfectly diſcerned in that innocent age, ſhe that acquainted me with all theſe things, and that lived with her both at that time, and afterwards in the Seraglio, hath told me, that in her rendreſt infancy, ſhe had an imperious ſpirit, which could not endure to be controlled by any body. She would alwaies be miſtris of all the other little girles that played with her; and her very play was dextrous ſtill, and malitious. She told me further, that ſhe was never ſeen to weep, nor ask for pardon, neither did ever perſon tell a lye with more confidence. She was curious to knovv all things, and one of her greateſt delights was to ſee beaſts fight together. This cruell hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour vvas for all that ſo well concealed, by the gentleneſs of her look, as ſhe ſeemed to be the moſt amiable child that ever was beheld. I leave you to judge, Madam, whether <hi>Bajazet</hi> finding ſo toward a diſpoſition to receive his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60144:118"/> did not make up an accompliſhed work. He did not teach her to be vertuous, but onely to be carefull to ſeem ſo. In her youngeſt years he laboured to frame her to a gracefull behaviour, and to entertain her alwaies with great hopes; to promiſe her that one day ſhe ſhould be rich, and that ſhe ſhould have ſtately Palaces, to the end that he might inſinuate into her betimes, that Greatneſs was the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign good: and that ſo deſiring it with paſſion, ſhe might be the more eaſily carried afterwards to do all things neceſſary for the acquiring of it. When ſhe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the age of eleven or twelve years, and that ſhe had a forward wit, able to apprehend his maxims, he began to ſpeak more plainly to her, and to tell her, that being born with no common beauty, ſhe was to make her ſelf an extraordinary fortune. But as it was the office of the eyes to obtain conqueſts, ſo it was the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wit to conſerve them. That all things which are gained by violence, are to be retained by addreſs. That it was time for her to learn to know her ſelf, and to know others; to the end that being accuſtomed to apply her mind to the divers humors of thoſe ſhe converſed with, ſhe might one day be capable of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly diſguiſing her thoughts: that ſhe was not to live ſo out of a baſe compliance, and with no other deſign than to pleaſe; but only to attain to ſome thing that was great. With ſuch like diſcourſes as theſe did <hi>Bajazet</hi> inſtruct <hi>Roxelana,</hi> whoſe incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations were but too much carried to diſſimulation. Nevertheleſs it is true, that theſe dangerous leſſons, which ſhe willingly learned, were combated by the wiſdom of her mother, whom I have alwayes called the fair Slave, becauſe my memory could not give you her name. This woman was good and vertuous, and did all that ſhe could to make <hi>Roxelana</hi> reſemble her, as well in the qualities of the ſoul, as in the features of the face: which <hi>Bajazet</hi> perceiving, and having in vain forbidden her to reprehend her daughter for her bad conditions, he fell into ſuch a hatred of her, as he could not indure her; and having looked upon her in former times as the object of his love, he conſidered her no longer but as an obſtacle of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But to keep her from deſtroying that which he had eſtabliſhed in the young heart of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> he thought it would be requiſite to make her hate her. And to that end, he dextrouſly perſwaded her, that her mother ſtanding yet upon her beauty, was jealous of ſeeing hers ſurpaſs it; that her reproving her, was an effect rather of hatred than affection, and that therefore ſhe ſhould beware of hearkning to her Remonſtrances; there needed no more to ſtifle all the motions of Nature in ſo depraved a ſpirit, and to carry her to inſolency. <hi>Roxelana,</hi> to obey her father, was to do no more than follow her own humour, but to content her mother, ſhe was to fight with all her inclinations. The firſt was the eaſier, and made her hope that it would produce great things; and the other being harder, and without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recompence, than that which gives us the ſatisfaction to do what we ought; ſhe had not much adoe to reſolve upon the deſpiſing of vertue, and imbracing of vice. Behold her then abandoned to her own ſenſe, and to the evill counſells of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and the fair Slave almoſt reduced to be a Slave to her daughter, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while uſed her ſo cruelly, that ſhe fell ſick with grief upon it. Now to make a tryall of what ſhe could do in diſſimulation, as long as there was any company with her mother, ſhe ſeemed reſpectfull, affectionate, and obedient; but as ſoon as they were gone, ſhe mocked openly at her goodneſs, and with an hundred bitter jeers, ſtruck a dagger into the heart of her that had given her life. This prudent woman was for all that ſo good as not to publiſh the cruelty of her daughter, who in the opinion of all them which ſaw her, was as vertuous as beautifull. <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſeeing ſo fair a beginning in <hi>Roxelana,</hi> careſſed her extraordinarily, and by this cruell proceeding ſtill advanced the death of her, whom he had loved ſo much before. At laſt, that deadly moment, wherein ſhe was to leave this life, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, this infortunate one called to her the Slave, who hath recounted all theſe things unto me, and that had wit and ſome vertue, and ſecretly commanded her not to abandon her daughter after her death, becauſe it might happen that this firſt heat of youth being over, ſhe might peradventure be capable of following the counſell which ſhe had given her; that for this effect ſhe prayed her to doe two things; the one was, not to bewail her death, for fear it ſhould oblige <hi>Roxelana</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60144:118"/> to turn her away; and the other, that ſhe ſhould not directly oppoſe her will, for fear of incenſing rather than correcting her; but to wait upon her till ſhe was of a more reaſonable age. This S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ave promiſed to perform all that ſhe deſired, and indeed kept her word with her. Preſently thereupon this woman dyed, and left <hi>Bajazet</hi> in full poſſeſſion of <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> heart, who with feigned tears teſtified ſo much grief for the loſs of her mother, as ſhe moved all them to pity that ſaw her, though in her mind ſhe was very joyfull. She lived two years in this ſort after the death of her mother, being then about fifteen; during which time ſhe was beloved of all the young Gallants where ſhe dwelt; ſhe perſwaded them all that ſhe loved them, without ingaging her ſelf for all that in any thing; and taking delight in giving them great hopes, to put them into deſpair afterwards, ſhe made ſome dye with grief; others killed one another by means of the hatred that ſhe ſowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and the jealouſie which ſhe her ſelf gave them, when as they impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned her, and that ſhe would be rid of them. And all this with ſo much addreſs, as all the world believed her to be innocent of all theſe crimes, and attributed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of all thoſe that beheld her. But at length being arrived at the age which I have noted unto you, <hi>Bajazet</hi> called her to him one day in private; and after he had told her, that the time was then come wherein he was to reap the fruit of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells, and ſhe to put in practiſe that which he had ſo often taught her, to the end ſhe might that way become the chief of all the Orient. <hi>Roxelana</hi> anſwered him, that he was but to explane his intention unto her, and then he ſhould be ſure to have it executed. Whereupon he recounted all his Hiſtory to her, which ſhe had never underſtood well before, and after that elevating his voice, and taking her by the hand, Thou ſeeſt then, my dear child, ſaid he unto her, that love did heretofore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do my fortune, and that a Slave which I took from the grand Signior, took from me all my hopes, and baniſhed me from my Country. But to find out my re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by the ſame way that cauſed my undoing, love, and a voluntary Slave ſhall reſtore me into grace with <hi>Soliman.</hi> And not to conceal my thoughts from thee, I purpoſe to preſent and give thee to the Grand Signior, leaving the reſt to fortune, and thy addreſs. I know that this Prince being advanced in age, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come yet more ſenſible of love, than he was fifteen years ago, when as he was but nineteen; for out of the deſign which a long time I have had, I have carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed my ſelf thereof. He is ſtill young, he is handſome, he is full of ſpirit, he is couragious, he is liberall; and what is moſt conſiderable, he is one of the greateſt Princes of the world.

At length they arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and went to the houſe of one of <hi>Bajazets</hi> antient friends, where the day being come, in which he purpoſed to preſent <hi>Roxelana,</hi> her ſlave helped to dreſs and ſet her forth, being glad to ſee her going out of the hands of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> for that ſhe was perſwaded there could be no place in the world where ſhe would not be better than with him. But whereas the habit of the women of the Iſle of <hi>Chio</hi> is more advantagious than ours, it was in this faſhion that ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was attired; and I have heard it ſaid, that one could not ſee any thing more magnificent, or more beautifull than ſhe was in that eſtate. She had on a waſtcoat of ſilver'd Damask, with two rows of Diamonds ſet upon a welt of curled cloath of gold, which bordered it all about; the petticoat was of the ſame ſtuff, and adorned in the ſame manner, and according to their faſhion plained very thick both before and behind, and ſmooth on the ſides. Her petticoat
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60144:119"/> came not but to the middle of the leg, becauſe in the Town of <hi>Chio</hi> they much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſhow the handſomeneſs of it, as well as that of the foot, which is very neat; for they ordinarily wear high Cork ſhooes of fine leather of the Levant, ſharp at the toes, and all garniſhed over with Goldſmiths work enammelled. <hi>Roxelana</hi> had alſo an apron of cloath of gold, a little ſhorter than her petticoat, and which was tyed behind with two ſilver ſtrings, whereat hung two taſſells of gold. She had upon her ſhoulders, as it were to faſten on the ſleeves of her waſtcoat, a great many of ribbands of divers colours, and athwart her neck a ſcarf of Tiffany hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baudrikewiſe, and cloſed together with Diamonds, in ſuch ſort as all her neck was ſeen, about the which ſhe had a chain of Pearl, with a little jewell of Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds. The attire of her head was of cloath of ſilver, plaited with a great deal of addreſs, and inriched all over with Pearls and Diamonds: This head-tire was of a round form, and ſtanding up very high behind; and to hold it on the better, ſhe had according to the uſe of the Countrey a little gold fillet with which it was made faſt behind on her neck, where hung two taſſells of the ſame in the midſt of a great number of knots of ſeverall colours, which fell careleſly upon her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And on the cop of her forehead, deſcending a little into a peak, ſhe had a dreſſing of Cobweb Lawn ſtreaked with gold, which alſo was faſtned behind, leaving her hair hanging down in curls on either ſide of her cheeks. In this manner was <hi>Roxelana</hi> attired; but before he led her to the Seraglio, <hi>Bajazet</hi> would give her his laſt inſtructions; wherefore he took her aſide, and willing her to hearken attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him, he ſpake to her much after this ſort; for the ſlave, who hath told me all theſe things, over-heard him without his perceiving it. It is time, my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for me to diſcover unto you the means whereby you may arrive at the point which I deſire. I have indeed ſaid ſomething unto you at ſeverall times, but now I am reſolved to hide no part of a Science from you, on which I have a long while meditated. Before I ſhew you then the ways you are to hold, I muſt propound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the term of your pretenſions, which ought not to be only to pleaſe the Grand Signior; to make him in love with you; to be a Sultana, as many others; but indeed to become his wife. For although none of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Emperors ſince <hi>Bajazet</hi> the firſt hath been maryed, becauſe they would not ſhare their power; yet ought not this obſtacle ſmother your deſires, but contrarily it ought to inflame them the more. You perceive then, continued he, that in ſo great a deſign, there is need of a great deal of prudence to carry one well unto it. The generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which I will give you upon your entring into the Seraglio, is, never to do, nor to ſay any thing, which tends not to this deſign, either directly, or indirectly; and to remember, that all the ways which may conduct us whither we would go, are permitted us by true reaſon. Never amuſe your ſelf then in conſulting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which you do be juſt; but indeed whether it be advantagious for you. Conſider not, whether you hurt any, but whether that which you do may ſerve your turn. For in fine, you go to a place where you will meet with envyers, and enemies, and no ſooner ſhall <hi>Soliman</hi> be ſtriken in love with your beauty, but you will be hated of all the Sultanaes. Prepare your ſelf then to know how to make a right uſe of all theſe things; and ſo do, that the hate which is born you may deſtroy them, who would deſtroy you. Never undertake to be revenged, but when you can abſolutely do it; yea, and if it be poſſible, revenge your ſelf ſo as you may not bee ſuſpected for it. Moreover, <hi>Alicolaes</hi> adventure makes me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Soliman</hi> is pleaſed with modeſty, wherefore ſo carry your ſelf, as it may be very much ſeen in all your actions; and beware of truſting any body. Regard every one as your enemy, careſs all your fellows, and love none of them; make not their defects known to <hi>Soliman,</hi> but in ſeeming to excuſe them; be carefull to let him underſtand by ſome other the malice which they bear you; bee liberall to them that are about the Grand Signior; be very ſubmiſſive and pleaſing to him, untill you know that you are abſolute Miſtris of his heart; for in fine, you muſt ſerve, that you may reign; but then, you muſt change your ſtile, and by ſome artifice, which you may invent according
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60144:119"/> to the time and occaſion, oblige him to mary you. And after that, whereas I have told you heretofore, how that which is gained by violence, ought to be conſerved by addreſs, in this incounter, that which you have gained by addreſs, muſt be conſerved by violence. You are to undo all thoſe that would hurt you, and not to ſpare either Iron, fire, or poyſon, to maintain the power whereunto you ſhall be arrived. In the mean time, to facilitate the matter, and to procure you friends out of the Seraglio, it will be requiſite for you, when you are once there, to win <hi>Soliman</hi> with tears of tenderneſs to render my fortune happy, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him that you cannot be perfectly contented, ſo long as your father is not ſo too. If you behave your ſelf in this ſort, ſaid he unto her, you ſhall be ſure to be very quickly the chiefeſt and moſt powerfull of your ſex, and the happieſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever was. <hi>Bajazet</hi> had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but <hi>Roxela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ſaid to him ſmiling, that to do all thoſe things ſhe had no need of his counſel, but was only to follow her own inclinations, which would carry her to more yet than what he had told her. He embraced her then wholly raviſhed with joy to ſee her in this reſolution; and before ſhe departed, ſhe aſſured her ſlave, that ere it were three dayes ſhe would get her into the Seraglio for to wait upon her, as indeed ſhe failed not to perform it accordingly. But at length <hi>Bajazet</hi> conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his daughter to the Seraglio, and cauſed <hi>Soliman</hi> to be advertiſed, that there was a man attending to preſent a ſlave unto him, without letting him know who he was. For whereas the Officers had been all changed ſince his departure from thence, and that he had not been ſeen in ſixteen years at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he did not fear he ſhould be named to <hi>Soliman.</hi> The matter fell out as he deſired; and the grand Signior, very luckily for his deſign, hapned to be in the beſt humour of the world, by reaſon he had received news of a great Victory which he had obtained over the Chriſtians. Wherefore he preſently commanded, that this ſlave, and he which brought her, ſhould enter. When <hi>Bajazet</hi> firſt appeared, <hi>Soliman</hi> knew him not, whether it were for that time had altered him, or that his eyes and heart were ſo fixed on the beauty of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> as he did not conſider him. But as ſoon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Bajazet</hi> had caſt himſelf at his feet, and that he had begun to ſpeak, the tone of his voyce made him call him to mind: He did not interrupt him for all that, but looking ſtill on <hi>Roxelana,</hi> he hearkned to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> without turning his head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. <hi>Roxelana</hi> on her ſide appeared with ſo modeſt a Majeſty, and ſo charming a ſweetneſs, as it had been very hard to diſcern the motions of her ſoul in her eyes, and not to be ſtrucken in love with ſuch powerfull attracts. But whilſt <hi>Soliman</hi> takes in ſo ſweet and ſo deadly poyſon, <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſpake to him in theſe terms; I know very well, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, that it is a crime in me to preſent my ſelf before thee, after I have been baniſhed; and that if thou beeſt not the moſt indulgent Prince of the World, thou wilt not permit me to give thee reaſons for it, which may excuſe me. But ſince thy ſilence ſeems to accord me ſo much, I ſhall let thee know, my Lord, that this young Slave whom thou ſeeſt here, and whom I preſent to thy Highneſs as a thing that appertains unto thee, is the daughter of that fair Slave whom I preſumed to retain for my ſelf, though ſhe were deſtined to thee. Reject her not, my Lord, ſince though ſhe be the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an offendor, yet is ſhe ſo too of a woman that belonged unto thee, and vvhoſe vertue hath paſſed into her as well as her beauty. In fine, it is a ſacrifice, which I offer up unto thee, to expiate the crime which heretofore I committed, and that alſo which at this preſent I commit. Conſider, I beſeech thee, that having robbed thee of one ſlave, it is but juſt that I ſhould render thee another; but with this difference, that the former was thy ſlave by violence, and that this ſame is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſlave: That the other had been in the hands of Pirates, and that this ſame hath been alwaies conſerved as an offering, whereof the purity ought to deface the blackneſs of my faults. But if nevertheleſs thou judgeſt her unworthy of this honour, I am moſt ready to give thee both her life and mine own, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to live any longer abſent from thy ſervice, and to ſpend the remainder of my daies without contributing ought to thy glory. When <hi>Soliman</hi> ſaw that <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60144:120"/> had made an end of ſpeaking, he cryed out, reaching forth his hand to him, O happy was that theft of thine, ſince it was the cauſe of thy now rendring me an ineſtimable treaſure! For I profeſs unto thee, that I never ſaw any thing ſo beautifull as thy preſent. Then turning him to <hi>Roxelana;</hi> and for thee, fair maid, ſayd he unto her, be aſſured that in loſing a father, thou findeſt a lover; and that in conſideration of thee alone, I will give <hi>Bajazet</hi> his liberty again, and reſtore him to all his former charges and honours. <hi>Roxelana</hi> made no other anſwer thereunto, than with a profound reſpect; but <hi>Bajazet</hi> was ſo over-joyed with ſo happy a beginning, as he thought he ſhould never have done rendring thanks to <hi>Soliman.</hi> At laſt, after ſome other ſpeeches, the grand Signior cauſed one of the Governeſſes of the women of the Seraglio to come to him, and remitted her into her hands, with order to lodge her alone, and in one of the faireſt lodgings in the womens quarter. And out of a particular grace, he commanded to be given unto her the very ſame day, great ſtore of jewels, apparell, ſumptuous houſhold-ſtuff, and mony, with ſix ſlaves to ſerve her. And whereas ſhe ſeemed to regret one which ſhe had, the Grand Signior cauſed her to be inſtantly brought in unto her. But I had forgot to tell you, that when ſhe was ſeparated from her father, ſhe affected to ſeem good and ſenſible; the tears came into her eyes, ſhe looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him as far as ſhe could ſee him; and with this feigned teſtimony of naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhe touched the heart of <hi>Soliman</hi> yet more; for whereas her tears were without bitterneſs, they did but make her ſhew the fairer. But conſider, I pray you, how deceitfull and ill-aſſured humane prudence is, eſpecially when it works againſt reaſon and equity. <hi>Bajazet</hi> had all his life-time been maſtered by two mighty paſſions, love, and ambition; the firſt made him loſe his fortune, when as he betrayed <hi>Soliman,</hi> and the other made him loſe his life; as if the divine Juſtice would not let him enjoy a good, which he had acquired by a crime: For he had not been eight days re-eſtabliſhed in his charges, and <hi>Roxelana</hi> in the Seraglio, when as being gone to viſit the Baſſa of the ſea, vvho was then at <hi>Pera,</hi> where the Arſenall and Magazine of all Maritime things were, he arrived there juſt as they were ready to try fifty Caſt-pieces, which were to be uſed in ſome ſhipping that was ſhortly to be ſet forth. And whereas the Baſſa would be preſent in perſon at this tryall, it was in this employment that <hi>Bajazet</hi> found him. After the firſt complements, the Baſſa told him, how that which he was going to do, vvas as much to congratulate his happy return to the Port, as to acquit himſelf of the duty of his charge; whereupon he commanded fire to be given: But to ſhew that the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of heaven would puniſh <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the firſt piece burſt aſunder, and in the midſt of two thouſand perſons, and ſome four paces from the Baſſa of the ſea, a ſhiver of that Cannon picked him out, and carried him away, with ſuch violence, as he was almoſt reduced into powder, ſo ſtrangely were his limbs diſperſed. And that which is yet remarkable alſo in what I deliver, is, that he was the ſole man, I do not ſay of them that were killed, but of them that were hurt, and hovv that was the onely piece that burſt in ſunder. Behold, generous <hi>Axiamira,</hi> in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Bajazet</hi> enjoyed his hopes, and the recompenſe which he had for all his crimes. The news of his death was ſoon carried to the Seraglio; <hi>Roxelana</hi> ſhewed a great deal of ſorrow for it; and out of a ſenſe of intereſt ſhe was really grieved thereat. But in a few daies, the markes which the Grand Signior rendred her of his affection comforted her. For whereas ſhe did not regret him, but becauſe ſhe had believed him to be uſefull for her greatneſs, when as ſhe hoped that ſhe might attain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto without him, ſhe quite forgot him; Yea and was glad that ſhe was diſcharged of the care of his fortune, and to have nothing to think of but her own. <hi>Roxolana</hi> had not been fifteen daies in the Seraglio, but ſhe ſo abſolutely poſſeſſed the Grand Signior, as none of the reſt of the Sultanaes could pretend to a favourable regard from him, but by ſpeaking well to him of her; or that he knew they had been ſomewhat gratious with her; which poſſeſſed them with no little jealouſie, and no leſs ſpight. But that which vexed them more was, that they could not find occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to miſſay of her amongſt themſelves, whereby they might at leaſtwiſe have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60144:120"/> been eaſed with this weak remedy. For ſhe was excellently fair; ſhe ſeemed extreme gentle; ſhe had an agreable and entertaining wit; ſhe was civill to the Sultanaes; liberall to the Slaves; moſt reſpectfull of <hi>Soliman;</hi> and in all her actions affected an extraordinary devotion. She lived a while in this ſort, without any croſs in her good fortune, and with ſo much ſatisfaction to <hi>Soliman,</hi> as there was never any joy equall to that which appeared in his humor. But at length the Sultanaes ſeeing that the love of the Grand Signior was not allayed by the enjoying her, and that contrarily it augmented daily, they combined together, and forgetting all the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſecret hatreds which they had had one againſt another, they indeavoured to deſtroy the perſon that deſtroyed them. She that incited them the moſt thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was the chief of the Sultanaes, the mother of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who at that time was brought up in the Seraglio, and was then about ſix or ſeaven yeares old. This wo-woman, who had a great and generous ſpirit, could not indure to ſee, that ſhe, who had given <hi>Soliman</hi> a Sonne, and a ſucceſſor to the Empire, ſhould be leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than <hi>Roxelana.</hi> It was by her interpoſition then, that all the other Sultanaes joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her, and promiſed never to omit any oportunity that might annoy <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elana.</hi> This counſell, or to ſay better, this conſpiracie, could not be ſo ſecretly made, but that <hi>Roxelana,</hi> by her liberality to the Slaves, which brought her preſents from their Miſtreſſes, and that much affected her, was advertiſed thereof. But hear, I pray you, in what manner ſhe oppoſed this ſtorm vvhich vvas ryſing up againſt her, and I am ſure you vvill acknovvledge, that ſhe vvas then as ingenious, as ſhe hath been vvicked ſince. This conſpiracy nothing daunted her; ſhe ſeemed neither more unquiet, nor more penſive; and all the change vvhich ſhe brought to her life was, that ſhe never ſaw <hi>Soliman,</hi> without ſpeaking ſome good of one or other of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanaes. She praiſed the beauty of one, the humor of another, the gracefulneſs of this, and the ſtature of that; but particularly ſhe ſeemed very much to eſteem of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> and ſo careſſed that young Prince, as it had been impoſſible at that time to have foreſeen by the apparences that which hath ſince fallen out. And whereas ſhe knew that the mother of the Sultan had a great power over him, ſhe wonne her wholly to her ſelf. Now <hi>Roxelanes</hi> deſign was, to deſtroy by this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all the ill which the Sultanaes could ſay of her to <hi>Soliman.</hi> For ſaid ſhe, when he ſhall ſee that they, for whom I do ſo many good offices to him, would hurt me, he wil have them in horror, and think the better of me. The matter failed not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as ſhe had imagined it. For one of the Sultanaes, whom <hi>Roxelana</hi> had the moſt commended, having underſtood that ſhe had ſent a little coffer full of jewells out of the Seraglio, which is not permitted in that place, ſhe advertiſed <hi>Soliman</hi> of it, who ſcarcely hearkning to what ſhe ſaid, called her ingratefull and diſacknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging; and without obliging <hi>Roxelana</hi> to the juſtifying of her ſelf, he ſent her a preſent of importance. After this, none of the Sultanaes durſt venture upon any ſuch like adventure. But <hi>Roxelana,</hi> who was not contented with keeping them from doing her hurt, and that placed her ſupremeſt felicity in doing hurt to others abſolutely gained to her three Slaves, two Eunuchs, and ſuborned alſo two of the Sultanaes; who went jointly together and advertiſed <hi>Soliman</hi> of this ſecret counſell which was held againſt <hi>Roxelana,</hi> without making ſhew for all that of her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of it. <hi>Soliman</hi> recompences them for this advice, commands them not to ſpeak of it; and whereas this crime was too generall, he reſolved to puniſh them who had committed it, and by one onely way, which was to make <hi>Roxelana,</hi> richer, greater, and more happy than ſhe was. He ſends for her, recounts unto her that, which ſhe knew better than he, by telling her what had been done againſt her; and in concluſion aſſures her, that nothing can deſtroy the affection he beares her. <hi>Roxelana,</hi> after ſhe had heard this diſcourſe, intreates <hi>Soliman</hi> to pardon them this crime who had committed it; and with a falſe generoſitie ſo powerfully charmes the heart of this noble Prince, as it was more at the diſpoſing of <hi>Roxela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> than of <hi>Soliman</hi> himſelf. But to come to the end of my diſcourſe, a little while after ſhe found her ſelf with childe, and the time of her lying down being come, ſhe brought forth <hi>Soliman</hi> a ſonne, who was named <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Untill then ſhe had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60144:121"/> never thought of any thing but maintaining her ſelf; but when ſhe came to conſider that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> would reign one day, and that according to the cuſtom of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, her ſon ſhould be ſtrangled; this awaked her former ambition, and all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns tended no longer but to be ſpeedily the wife of a Prince, of whom ſhe was the abſolute Miſtreſs; to the end that in this illuſtrious eſtate, ſhe might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily deſtroy <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> for her ſon to reign. And mark a little whereunto ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carried this woman, who thought already of ſetting the Crown on the head of a child, who knew not as yet that he was living! howſoever, it was not out of the abſolute power that ſhe had over the mind of <hi>Soliman,</hi> that ſhe attained to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but by an artifice which I am going to relate unto you. She knew that in one of the books of our Religion the Soveraign is forbidden the poſſeſſing of a free woman; and ſhe knew alſo that in another, a Slave is not permitted to build either Moſque or Hoſpitall, or to do any other thing that may be available for the other life. Upon this foundation ſhe built her deſign; and knowing that the <hi>Muphti</hi> carried a great ſtroke vvith the Grand Signior, ſhe vvon him vvith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, vvhich ſhe ſent him ſecretly; and ſo being ſure of his aſſiſtance vvhen ſhee ſhould have need of it, behold hovv ſhee proceeded therein. She ſent to the <hi>Muphti,</hi> who is the man that takes cognizance of all matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to let him underſtand that ſhe had an extreme deſire to build a Moſque, and an Hoſpitall, where all poor Pilgrims might be lodged and fed; but before ſhe would undertake it, ſhe would fain know whether this would be pleaſing to the Prophet. The <hi>Muphti</hi> anſwers according to her deſire, and as ſhe knew that he would anſwer; that the thing would be pleaſing to the Prophet, but abſolutely unprofitable for the ſecond life of her ſoul, becauſe ſhe was the Grand Signiors Slave, and that whatſoever ſhe had being <hi>Solimans,</hi> and not hers, all that ſhe ſhould do in this eſtate would be to the advantage of the Grand Signior, and not of her. This anſwer received, ſhe feigns to be exceeding melancholick, ſhe deprives her ſelf of all her ordinary delights; and when the Grand Signior viſits her, ſhe lets her ſelf be ſurpriſed ſtill in ſome muſe, whereat ſhe ſeems afterwards to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what grieved, and to ſtrive to break her ſelf from it. At laſt ſhe playes her part ſo dextrouſly, as the Grand Signior began to be troubled upon his obſerving this change of her humour. At firſt he was contented to ask of her what it was that made her ſo ſad? but ſhe anſwering that it was an effect of her temperature, it put him into further pain. He inquires of the ſlaves that ſerve her, whether any one hath given her cauſe to complain? they anſwer, that they know of none; but how it is true, that their Miſtreſs had been for a good while ſo melancholick, as they did not think ſhe could live long in that ſort. For indeed when <hi>Roxelana</hi> was alone with them, ſhe always ſeemed exceeding ſad, to the end that being the firſt deceived, they might the more eaſily deceive others, fore-ſeeing rightly, that <hi>Soliman</hi> would inquire of them that ſerved her, what ſhe ailed. But becauſe ſhe would not be always in conſtraint, ſhe ſhut her ſelf up the moſt part of the day in her Cabinet; and this unaccuſtomed retirement ſerved yet very much to make it be credited that ſhe had ſome hidden grief. <hi>Soliman</hi> being advertiſed then of all theſe things, began to fall into extreme unquietneſs: he conjured <hi>Roxelana</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the cauſe of her ſadneſs, and not to conceal the ſecrets of her heart from a Prince, who had given his ſo abſolutely to her; he told her, that if any one had wronged her, he would revenge her for it; and in concluſion, that there was nothing which ſhe might not obtain from him. Hereunto ſhe anſwered, that the reſpect alone which ſhe bore him, kept her from obeying him, and that ſhe had always rather die than diſpleaſe him. So preſſing a diſcourſe failed not to work the effect which ſhe attended from it; <hi>Soliman</hi> was mightily moved with it, and beholding her with eyes, which ſhared with her in her grief, he ſwore that he would not part from her till he knew what it was that troubled his felicity. She reſiſts yet a while, he preſſes her the more, and ſpeaks to her with ſuch earneſtneſs, as ſhe thinks it was high time to diſcover her ſelf. She falls then at his feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches him to pardon her, and at laſt frames a diſcourſe filled with artifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60144:121"/> ſhe cauſes him to comprehend, that having had a deſign to imploy the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which he had given her, for the honor of the Prophet, and her own ſalvation, in building of a Moſque and an Hoſpitall for Pilgrims, ſhe had underſtood that ſhe was incapable thereof, becauſe ſhe was his Slave, whereas for that purpoſe one ought to be of a free condition. That ſhe confeſſed unto him, how the fear of the ſecond life had ſo ſeized upon her ſoul, as ſhe doubted ſhe ſhould not be able to anſwer the two black Angells; and how the thought that ſhe could never be able to do any thing for her ſalvation, troubled her in ſuch ſort, as it was impoſſible for her to hope for one hour of tranquillity in all her life. <hi>Soliman</hi> hearing her ſay thus, lifts her up, complains for that ſhe hath ſo long concealed ſo juſt a deſire from him, and in the end aſſures her, that within a ſhort time ſhe ſhould be contented. As indeed the next day he ſent her a Patent of her Affranchiſement, vvhich he had cauſed to be dravvn up in the moſt authenticall form that is uſed amongſt us, and vvithall ordered ſo much money to be delivered unto her as ſhe vvould demand. Behold her then the moſt contented vvoman that ever vvas, ſeeing ſo proſperous a beginning of her enterprize. She thinks no longer in apparence of any thing but her buildings; ſhe communicates her deſigns to <hi>Soliman,</hi> vvho on his ſide eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf very happy in having been able to cure the mind of <hi>Roxelana</hi> of ſo black a melancholy. But vvhen as a little after he vvould have her come and paſs the night vvith him at his lodging, he vvas much abaſhed to ſee her, being alone vvith him, caſt her ſelf at his feet, and vvith her eyes full of tears, and a voyce interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith ſighs, hear her ſay unto him; I knovv full vvell, my Lord, that thou art the Maſter of our goods, of our bodies, and of our lives; and that thy vvill ought to be abſolute Miſtreſs of ours. But, my Lord, it novv concerns the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Heaven, the Precepts of our Prophet, and the Lavv vvhich vve profeſs, vvhich vvill not permit thee to diſpoſe of me being free. Give heed then, my Lord, to that which I ſay, and draw not the indignation of Heaven upon thy head, for a crime whereof I ſhould be the cauſe: For rather than I will reſolve to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this fault, I am capable of taking away mine own life, ſo much do I fear leſt it ſhould prove unlucky and fatall unto thee. As long as I was thy Slave, I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted thy pleaſure, knowing that both divine and humane Laws commanded me unto it: But now that I am free, and that therefore I cannot be thine, without tranſgreſſing the Law, I think that I do as I ought in this my oppoſing thee. <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe, as he knew not what reſolution to take. His paſſion was ſtrong, but his reſpect to matters of Religion was alſo very great, and the tears and prayers of <hi>Roxelana</hi> fortified it in ſuch ſort, as he reſolved to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law, if it proved to be ſo. He ſends for the <hi>Muphti,</hi> propounds the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to him, and commands him to examine it well. But this man who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been made, and inſtructed by <hi>Roxelana,</hi> tells him that this queſtion was fully reſolved; that the Soveraign could not poſſeſs a free woman without marying her, or without committing an horrible crime. He reports the paſſage of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> to him, fortifies it with reaſons which he had premeditated, and at laſt leaves <hi>Soliman</hi> perſwaded that he cannot poſſeſs <hi>Roxelana</hi> without ſinning. Behold him then, in a grief which is not imaginable: For <hi>Roxelana</hi> had choſen out a time when as he was in the violence of his love. The reſpect of the Law retained him, the heat of his paſſion ſollicited him, and the example of his Predeceſſors, and the Maxims of State, kept him from ſatisfying himſelf by a lawfull way: For never ſince the ignominy which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> cauſed the wife of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the firſt to ſuffer, none of the Emperors had maried, for fear leſt by ſuch a like adventure, their enemies might a ſecond time do that wrong to the Majeſty of the Empire. What ſhall I do, ſaid <hi>Soliman,</hi> in ſo croſs a conjuncture? If I poſſeſs <hi>Roxelana</hi> without marying her, I ſhall be faulty towards her, and culpable towards heaven. If I do mary her, I ſhall make all my Empire to murmure at it, I ſhall break an Order eſtabliſhed by my Predeceſſors with reaſon, and introduce a Novelty, which it may be will cauſe ſome revolt in my Eſtates. Now again, if I do not mary her, and reſolve not to poſſeſs her injuſtly; will <hi>Soliman</hi> be ſatisfied, after he hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60144:122"/> Religion, and reaſon of State, which ordained him ſo to do? Ah, no, no, he cannot live without <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and whatſoever comes of it we muſt be inſeparable; and without offending Heaven, I muſt render her happy in contenting my ſelf. If my Subjects murmure at it, I ſhall tell well enough how to bring them to their duty again, and teach them to ſubmit unto the pleaſure of him, to whom they are but Slaves. This reſolution being taken, he imparted it to <hi>Roxelana,</hi> who, as you may judge, rejoyced exceſſively at it. Howbeit ſhe in appearance received this news with a great deal of moderation, ſaying, that ſhe thought her ſelf unworthy of ſo great an honor. But within a few days after <hi>Soliman</hi> maryed her publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſolemn pomp. She ſent preſents to all the Sultanaes, but the Mother of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> to decline the ſeeing of her that day, feigned her ſelf ſick. Now to do her the more honour, and to declare her more abſolutely Queen, and Miſtris of all the Sultanaes, he cauſed a great Hall to be moſt ſumptuouſly furniſhed, where at the one end he made a Throne of four ſteps to be erected, covered all with cloth of Gold, and two Cuſhions of the ſame ſtuff, upon vvhich ſate hee and <hi>Roxelana,</hi> who had a Crown on her head, and her Gown ſet all over vvith Diamonds. Upon the ſecond degree of the Throne vvas the Mother of <hi>Soliman,</hi> who loved <hi>Roxelana</hi> as her ſelf; and upon the two lowermoſt, ſate the ſiſters and daughters of the grand Signior, for he had three by two of his ſlaves. Things being in this eſtate, all the Sultanaes came one after another richly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralled, to do obeyſance to <hi>Roxelana</hi> with an high reſpect; and for a mark of their dependance, they all brought magnificent preſents, and placed them ſome four paces from the Throne where <hi>Roxelana</hi> ſate. Divers of them brought Maunds of Gold full of Flowers; others, Vaſes of Emeraulds repleniſhed with Eſſences; ſome, little Coffers, garniſhed with precious Stones, and filled with Perfumes; and after they had left their preſents at the foot of the Throne, they went and placed themſelves in order on both ſides of the Hall upon their knees, as it were to doe homage to the new Queen. All theſe Sultanaes having remained ſo a while, an hundred young children, which are brought up about the grand Signior, came out of a particular grace to the womens Seraglio, where this ceremony was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and being arrived in the Hall, they began to dance, and to ſing ſomewhat to the glory of <hi>Roxelana;</hi> and being retired, all the Sultanaes went to kiſs her Robe, and then her hand, which ſhe held out unto them. And for a mark of their ſlavery, and her liberty, ſhe gave to each of them a chain of Diamonds; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the ſame order as they came, carrying in their hearts as much envy and jealouſie, as <hi>Roxelana</hi> had joy. As for the mother, the ſiſters, and daughters of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> they conducted <hi>Roxelana</hi> to the Grand Signiors lodging, where they left her in the height of her felicities, and retired to the old Seraglio thorough a door that opened near upon <hi>Solimans</hi> chamber. Untill then fraud and artifice were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things which ſhe had employed to arrive unto the point ſhe had deſired; but alaſs, how well did ſhe in this eſtate remember the bad leſſons which her father had given her! when as he had told her, how that which was gotten by addreſs, ought to be conſerved by violence. For ſhe no ſooner ſaw her ſelf the Wife of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but ſhe would needs ſhare with him in his power, and be acquainted with all the affairs of the Empire; ſhe baniſhed from the Port ſuch as were not pleaſing to her; and for fear leſt the <hi>Muphti,</hi> whom ſhe could not make greater than he was, ſhould reveal to ſome one, that her good fortune was not ſo much an effect of her devotion, according to her own ſaying, as of her artifice; it was thought that ſhe ſuborned one of his ſlaves, and cauſed him to be poyſoned; for he dyed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly; and ſome have conceived that he himſelf was aware of it, becauſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſick not above an hour after ſupper, when as he could ſcarce ſpeak for the violent pains that he felt, with much adoe yet he ſayd, that <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> Crown coſt him his life, whereupon he preſently dyed. After ſhe had ſecured her ſelf on that ſide, ſhe turned her eyes to <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> I think I have told you, that in the firſt year of her being in the Seraglio ſhe brought forth <hi>Soliman</hi> a ſonne, named <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but I am to let you underſtand further, that in the four following, ſhe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60144:122"/> had alſo three ſonnes and one daughter; the next after the eldeſt was called <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the third <hi>Selim,</hi> the laſt <hi>Gianger,</hi> and the daughter <hi>Chameria.</hi> She had been then five years in the Seraglio, and four the Wife of <hi>Soliman,</hi> when as they ſpake of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Muſtapha</hi> forth from his Mother, becauſe he was twelve years old, which is the furtheſt age wherein men are permitted to abide in the Seraglio. And whereas <hi>Roxelana</hi> ſaw how this young Prince promiſed great matters, ſhe feared it would not be alwaies ſo eaſie to deſtroy him, who alone could keep her children from reigning, when he ſhould be out of the Seraglio, as when he was in her hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe plotted his death, and for that effect, the ſame day that he was to depart, and the laſt meal that he was to make in the Seraglio, ſhe wrought in ſuch ſort, as there were ſerved up unto him certain fruits that were poyſoned, and which he exceedingly loved (at leaſtwiſe the ſlave, who recounted theſe things unto me, beleeved ſo much) but whereas the Prince was very much grieved to part from his mother, and to ſee the extreme ſorrow ſhe was in for it, he never thought of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting his palate; and perceiving that his mother did eat nothing, he beſought her not to afflict her ſelf ſo much, and that ſhe would eat ſomething for the love of him. Saying ſo, he preſented her with ſome of thoſe impoyſoned fruits, which were prepared for him, he little dreaming of any ſuch thing. The poor afflicted Mother, thinking it a crime to refuſe her ſonne, takes the fruit which he preſents her with, and to content him, eats it vvith her eyes all bathed in tears. But the infortunate <hi>Muſtapha</hi> knevv not that he gave death to her vvho had given him life; and that this crime vvhich he committed ſo innocently ſhould be one day ſeverely puniſhed in his perſon, though he vvere never accuſed for it: Having been in this occaſion, like thoſe innocent offerings, upon whom in times paſt amongſt certain Nations the crimes of all the people were charged. The poyſon which <hi>Roxelana</hi> had cauſed to be prepared was ſlow, to the end it ſhould make no noiſe; and that when <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſhould be out of the Seraglio, and <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould be told that he was ſick, ſhe might make him beleeve, that change of air had cauſed this malady. But deſtiny would not have the matter go ſo; for in fine, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this diſcourſe any further, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> went out of the Seraglio in good health, with no little grief to <hi>Roxelana,</hi> vvho had been advertiſed that he had not eaten of the impoiſoned fruit. As for the mother, that never troubled her; for though ſhe fell ſick the very ſame day, and dyed a moneth after, no body beleeved there was any thing extraordinary in her death; becauſe <hi>Roxelana</hi> had cauſed it to be bruited, how the ſorrow for <hi>Muſtaphaes</hi> cloignment was the cauſe of it, and how ſince that day ſhe had never been well; as indeed ſhe lyed not: and this was ſo generally beleeved, as the ſick Sultana her ſelf ſayd ſo much to them that came to viſit her, ſhe never ſuſpecting any wickedneſs. Behold, Madam, <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> firſt perſecution of the Prince <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> Indeed it is true, that he was not ſenſible of it, for he never knew any thing of that which I have told you. Now you muſt not imagine, that this violent deſire which ſhe hath alwayes had to deſtroy <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> whereby her children may reign, is a ſenſe of affection for them; ſhe hath not ſo legitimate a deſign, and the only thought which ſhe hath, is to remain the mother of an Emperor after the death of <hi>Soliman;</hi> becauſe ſhe knows very well, that this quality gives alwaies a great credit to thoſe which poſſeſs it; and brings them into veneration amongſt us. I ſhould never have done, if I would relate all her wickedneſſes unto you. But at length <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in ſpight of all her artifices lived, was brought up with great care, maryed an excellent Princeſs of the bloud of the antient Kings of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> whom he loved paſſionately, and proved, as you know, as excellent a Prince as ever was. And the hate which ſhe bore him could not keep the Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> from having as much good will for him, as ſhe had averſion. But to ſtrengthen her ſelf ſtill the more, as ſoon as her daughter had attained the age of thirteen yeares, ſhe got <hi>Soliman</hi> to mary her to the traitor <hi>Ruſtan;</hi> who for all that hath not forborn often betraying her ſelf, for he ſeekes his own greatneſs, and not hers. Behold, Madam, what the firſt wickedneſſes of <hi>Roxelana</hi> have been, for as for the reſt, you know them but too well. And it may ſuffice, that I have onely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60144:123"/> you her inclination. This woman never incountred perſon that oppoſed her violences, but the grand Viſier <hi>Ibraehim,</hi> who ever ſince he hath been amongſt us, hath had ſo much power with <hi>Soliman,</hi> as ſhe could never, he being the moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of men, make any of her wicked devices ſucceed, either againſt him, againſt <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> or <hi>Gianger</hi> (for he loved them both dearly) untill ſuch time as for our ill fortune, he went away, ſome ſix monthes agoe, upon a ſecret expedition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the world talks diverſly; for ſeeing the miſchiefes which have arrived by his abſence, it is feared leſt ſhe hath cauſed him to be murthered by the way. It being very certain, that if he had been here, the rage which ſhe had long ſhut up in her heart, had not broken out ſo deadly as it hath done. Alas! ſaid <hi>Axiamira</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her, how much hath he whom you ſpeak of been wiſhed for in vain of the Prince <hi>Gianger!</hi> And how often hath he ſpoken to me of him with a world of praiſe! But mother, continued ſhe, you have recounted ſo many things unto me, as <hi>Soliman</hi> me thinks ſhould be above an hundred yeares of age, and yet he ſeemed not ſo old unto me on that unhappy day wherein I ſaw him. It is, anſwered <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> becauſe I having enchained two Hiſtories in one, and begun to ſpeak of <hi>Soliman</hi> at the age ſeaventeen yeares, your mind, by the length of my narration, and the number of things which I recounted, hath thought that which you ſay. But if you pleaſe, I will let you ſee the contrary: <hi>Soliman</hi> was ſeaventeen yeares old, when <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> put the ſuppoſition of the Slave upon him; at the end of ſixteen yeares, when <hi>Roxelana</hi> was preſented unto him, he was thirty and three, ſhe fifteen, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſeaven: So that if you are ignorant of all theſe things, you will find, that <hi>Roxelana</hi> is not above ſeaven and thirty yeares of age, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was nine and twenty, <hi>Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> eighteen, and <hi>Soliman</hi> is fifty and four, though he ſeem not to be more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that which is ſtrange in this Prince is, that he is at this preſent of a more amorous humor, than he was in his younger yeares. I ſhall not have much ado, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Felixana,</hi> who had not ſpoken yet, to believe that which you ſay; and I know but too well by mine own experience, that there are men in whom age doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtir up paſſions, than appeaſe them. With ſuch like diſcources, <hi>Halima</hi> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to divert the Princeſſes melancholy; but remembring that ſhe had not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any thing of all that day, ſhe went to give order for the ſerving up of dinner. On the other ſide <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who had not forgot the deſign which he had, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Ulama,</hi> after he had ſpent part of the morning at the <hi>Divano,</hi> which was held that day, and the reſt of it with the Grand Signior, without ſpeaking of any other thing than the war of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he returned to his Palace, there to take along with him the Slave which <hi>Ulama</hi> had ſent to him, that he might carry him to the Caſtle of the ſeaven Towers, whither he went with an intention to eaſe the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others, ſince fortune would not let him find a remedy for his own.</p>

But whereas the Governor of that place had not underſtood of the grand Viſiers return, there had been no order taken for his entrance; howbeit his people had no ſooner advertiſed him of his being there, but he came to let him in himſelf, and to crave pardon for making him ſtay ſo. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> having accepted his excuſes, ſent him to advertiſe <hi>Axiamira</hi> of his arrival, and to know of her, whether he might have the permiſſion to ſee her.

                  <hi>Felixana</hi> had no ſooner made an end of reading this Letter, but ſhe deſired the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould ſee it, though out of civility he would not; telling her that he would rely more on her word, then ſhe had done on his, and that he would beleeve that which ſhe would pleaſe to let him know. But ſhe anſwered him, how it would not be juſt that he ſhould do ſo, and therefore beſought him to read it. Whil'ſt <hi>Ibrahim</hi> obeyed her, <hi>Felixana</hi> enquired of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> Slave, whether his wounds were dangerous? And when he had anſwered her, that they had been ſo, but were paſt the worſt, and that if it had not been for one in his leg he might have quitted his bed, ſhe asked him other queſtions, until ſuch time as the grand Viſier, having done reading of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> Letter, ſaid to her with a great deal of civility: It is for you, Madam, to furniſh me with means to ſerve you, and to acquaint me with all your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60144:124"/> to the end that knowing them, I may the more eaſily finde neceſſary remedies for them. But I know, fair <hi>Felixana,</hi> that this is to conſtrain your inclination, and that you had rather talk with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> Slave, then renew your ſorrows by calling them to remembrance; but to comfort you, I will promiſe to leave this Slave with you, until we have ſome pleaſing news to ſend <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama. Felixana</hi> thanked him for this favor, and aſſured him, that ſhe had no greater deſire then to obey him, though the remembrance of her miſeries would augment them; and that it may be they would afflict him too. For my Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, my adventures are ſo intermingled with thoſe of the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of two Princes whom you have dearly loved, as I am conſtrained to recount them; ſeeing it is certain that mine make but a part of theirs. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was glad to ſee her in this reſolution, for he hoped he ſhould know that by her, which <hi>Soliman</hi> would not tell him; ſo that cauſing her to ſit down, and <hi>Halima</hi> by her, he ſummoned her to the performance of her promiſe, which ſhe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner.</p>

                  <head>The Hiſtory of the Princeſs <hi>AXIAMIRA, ULAMA,</hi> and <hi>FELIXANA.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THat which you deſire to know of me, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> hath coſt me ſo many tears and ſighs, that if I did not ſtrive to turn away my thought from the laſt adventures of this Hiſtory, it were impoſſible for me to relate the beginning, where you will finde nothing but the hopes of an extream felicity for me. But to take things from their firſt ſource, and to render my diſcourſe more intelligible, I am to tell you, that <hi>Scach Tachmas,</hi> whom we call the <hi>Sophi,</hi> otherways King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> remained a widower almoſt as ſoon as his wiſe (who, as I have heard ſay, was an excellent Princeſs) had brought him two ſons, <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Mahamed,</hi> whereof the laſt is blinde; and two daughters, of which the one is the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> or to ſay better, the wonder of her age; and the youngeſt, named <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> is of an indifferent beauty, of a malicious humor, and of a minde uncapable of any kinde of friendſhip. As for <hi>Iſmael,</hi> it might be ſaid, that as he hath no great virtues, ſo he hath no great defects, and that he is in the rank of thoſe perſons, who do almoſt paſs away their lives ſo, as they can hardly be known to live, if their quality did not make it appear that they are in the number of the living. Now for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> the ſame cannot be ſaid of him, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily it ſeems, that Nature hath deprived him of the light of the day, to make it ſhine the more in his minde: For whether it be that this privation of ſight is the cauſe of its better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting it ſelf, and operating with the more activity; or that his memory, which is ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous in him, as it may be thought he hath never forgotten any thing, doth furniſh him with that which renders him agreeable; ſo it is that his converſation is ſo charming, as one can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be weary of it. But that which is moſt excellent in him is, that he is exceeding virtuous, and that his paſſions, though violent, have never ſurmounted his reaſon. Behold, my Lord, what the royal Family was, when I was brought to the Court, which was at that time in the City of <hi>Tauris.</hi> My Father had always been conſiderable enough in this Monarchy, and the <hi>Sophi,</hi> to teſtifie the eſteem he had of him, had made him Governor of <hi>Strabat</hi> and <hi>Mazan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deron,</hi> two very fair Towns, which are ſcituated on the bank of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my Father had marryed the ſiſter of the Governor of <hi>Tauris,</hi> it was by his means that I was put to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> with a many other maids of a condition equal to mine, which were divided between thoſe two Princeſſes; and were with them, as one might ſay, rather to help them to paſs away the time, then to do them any ſervice. <hi>Axiamira</hi> might be about fourteen years of age, and I fifteen; and whereas ſhe was younger then the Princes her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as I think, was not far from ſixteen. But to let you firſt know all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of whom I am to ſpeak in this Hiſtory, I ſhall tell you, that there was at the ſame time in the Court, one named <hi>Deliment,</hi> whoſe birth was not very noble; but who had, by means of his high ſpirit, and extream riches, ſo wrought himſelf into the Court, and good grace of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> as there was none but was afraid to be in ill terms with him: I ſay afraid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is certain that no man deſired his friendſhip, but for fear leaſt his hatred ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial unto him; and truly it is not to be marvelled if one could have no other opinion of him, for he was inſolent, ambitious, undertaking, beleeving there was ſcarce any thing worthy of him, eaſily offended, never pardoning, and that which rendred all his bad incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ons more dangerous, was, that he had a great wit. Now if <hi>Deliment</hi> were of this humor,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60144:125"/> 
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was oppoſite to him in all things, for his birth is noble, as being the chief man of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramania;</hi> his courage is without brutiſhneſs; and whereas you have not ſeen him but ſince he was infortunate, I conceive I may be permitted to tell you what he was during his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When I arrived at the Court nothing was ſpoken of but the valor of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama;</hi> for it was a little after the War of the <hi>Azemites,</hi> where having done wonders, and to ſay all, been the cauſe of the <hi>Sophies</hi> carrying away the victory; to recompence him for this great action, he made him <hi>Satrap</hi> of <hi>Caramania</hi> at two and twenty years of age, and gave him his ſiſter in marriage, whom <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> eſpouſed rather out of obedience, then out of inclination; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain that this Princeſs, as the incomparable <hi>Axiamira</hi> hath oftentimes told me, had nothing recommendable in her but her birth. And indeed, as if Heaven had found this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage unjuſt, a month after it was accompliſhed ſhe dyed of a burning Feaver: And whereas it is the cuſtom of the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> to have all the royal Family lodged in one and the ſame Palace, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> as brother-in-law to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> was lodged there too; ſo that though the women live very ſtraitly kept all over <hi>Perſia,</hi> yet left we not for all that to have a great deal of liberty, and to lead a life happy and pleaſant enough; having in the ſame Palace, the two Princes and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> whom we ſaw as much as they pleaſed: for the <hi>Sophi</hi> had ordained that the Princeſſes lodgings ſhould be open to them when they would, I and that all the <hi>Satraps</hi> young ſons might ſee and ſpeak to us when as they accompanyed the Princes. Things being in theſe terms at ſuch time as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> wife dyed, the Princeſſes went by the commandment of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> a little after the Funeral, to give a viſit to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> whom I had ſcarcely ever ſeen, becauſe I had not been above a month at the Court, and that during the ſame the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his wife had ſtill been very ſick. I have already told you, my Lord, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had not loved her, and I put you in minde of it, to the end you may not think it ſtrange if in this occaſion Love took his beginning in the time of a mourning, which had not drawn any tears. <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Perca</hi> made this viſit with ceremony, the young Princes conducted them, or to ſay better, <hi>Iſmael</hi> held up <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and <hi>Perca</hi> led <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who, as I have told you, was blinde from his birth, though he had the faireſt eyes to ſee to in the world; but he let himſelf be guided with ſo much addreſs, and went along with ſo confident a pace, as there was no body but would have been deceived in him. All the maids of honor followed after, as alſo ſix Ladies of quality, reaſonably well ſtept in years, which had been placed about the Princeſſes, to have a care of their behavior, and ours. And truly it muſt be acknowledged, that Feaſts of rejoycing do ſeldom ſhew any thing more goodly to behold, then the mourning which is in this Court; for whereas black is not in uſe there but when one mourns, if any of it be ſeen about ones apparel, it ſufficeth; nor is it exempted from magnificence. We were all then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired much after one; and to excuſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſo much the more, for letting himſelf be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe few charms which you ſee in my face, I will deſcribe <hi>Axiamira's</hi> habit unto you, that you may know what mine was; for ſhe had already taken ſo great a liking to me, as ſhe would have no other difference between her apparel and that I wore, but great ſtore of Diamonds which ſhe cauſed to be added thereunto whenſoever ſhe pleaſed; and withall, ſince that fatal day did beget love in four ſuch different hearts, it will not be amiſs for me to recount unto you all the particularities of it. <hi>Axiamira</hi> then had on a petticoat and waſtcoat of cloth of ſilver very glittering, and over that a gown of black Tiffany exceeding fine, whereof the body was plaited, ſo that it ſhewed the ſhape very perfectly; and the bottom of the skirt, which was cut in peaks, made way for the cloth of ſilver to be ſeen athwart it. The ſleeves were indifferent wide, but to give more liberty to the arm, they were faſtened upon the ſhoulder with claſps of Diamonds, leaving almoſt to open view the cloth of ſilver ſleeves that were under. Her Girdle was of great Pearls enchaced amongſt Diamonds: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde at her back were moreover two hanging ſleeves reaching to the ground, bordered with large borders of ſilver Embroidery, as well as the lower part of the Gown. Her neck was half hid with moſt delicate black cobweb-lawn, which was tyed on her ſhoulder with a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtring. And whereas our dreſſing is very high, there hung from the top of her head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a great vail, trailing to the very ground, of ſilver Tiffany, ſtreaked with black, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly plaited; which certainly gave a great deal of grace to the beauty of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and alſo ſupplyed that little which I had.</p>
                  <p>We went in this ſort then to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> Lodging, which, according to the cuſtom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that will have the houſes, whereof the Maſters or Miſtreſſes be dead, to are for ſix weeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60144:125"/> of the light of the Sun, had no other Light but that of Lamps. For whereas <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was of a condition to obſerve all requiſite Ceremonies; and that it was the ſiſter of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi,</hi> for whom he mourned, we found him in a chamber, hung with black Tinſel, ſtreaked with gold, and enlightened with an hundred lamps of chryſtal. <hi>Deliment</hi> was at that time with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who was likewiſe attired all in black, except it were that which we call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelbas,</hi> or red <hi>Turbant,</hi> which is never permitted to be left off, but onely to be covered with a black Cipres. I muſt confeſs that I never ſaw man of ſo goodly a preſence in <hi>Perſia,</hi> as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama</hi> was in that occaſion. He received the Princes and Princeſſes with ſo much addreſs and grace, that all my fellows were raviſhed with it. But when he had cauſed them to ſit down, and that we had ranked our ſelves on the other ſide of the chamber, where we remained ſtanding, I ſoon perceived that if I had thought him handſom, he did not think me diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſeeing that every time civility would permit him, he faſtened his eyes ſo on my face, as I was conſtrained to turn away mine; which made me obſerve how <hi>Deliment</hi> took more then ordinary care to entertain <hi>Axiamira;</hi> for this man of blood and fire had not till then looked upon any woman, but to deſpiſe her. And as if this chamber had had ſome fatalneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant the mindes of thoſe that were in it, the <hi>Sophi</hi> himſelf came to viſit <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> whil'ſt we were there, and for my ill fortune, he beheld me ſo favorably, as I paſt with him for the faireſt thing that ever he had ſeen. But whereas the time was not proper for gallantry, all theſe ſpringing paſſions were no otherwiſe made known then by looks, except in <hi>Deliment,</hi> who when the Princeſs hapned to go away, and that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was retired, advanced to lead <hi>Axiamira,</hi> whil'ſt <hi>Iſmael</hi> was yet talking with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama.</hi> She, that thought the Prince her B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>other would tarry behinde, received him with her ordinary civility, although ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly averſe to him. On the other ſide, <hi>Iſmael</hi> having finiſhed his complement, gave his hand to <hi>Perca,</hi> who, without thinking how the blinde Prince had not brought his ordinary guide along with him, ſuffred him to lead her; and whereas <hi>Mahamed</hi> perceived it, and was very dextrous, he made his diſcourſe endure as long as he could out of hope that ſome one or other would lend him their hand to conduct him. I confeſs that having marked the pain he was in, and moved with pity to ſee ſo goodly a Prince, ſo handſom, ſo ſprightly, and ſo amiable, in the unquietneſs wherein I ſaw him, I ſtept to him, without demanding permiſſion for it of the Governeſſes. My Lord, ſaid I unto him, the Princeſſes are gone, will not you be pleaſed to follow them? He that knew me by my voyce, Yes gladly, diſcreet <hi>Felixana,</hi> ſaid he unto me, if you will have the goodneſs to lead one that is blinde, who notwithſtanding his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot but know your merit. I obſerved by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> countenance, that he had a deſire to have ſpoken a gallantry to me thereupon; as indeed he hath ſince aſſured me, that civility onely kept him from it; but <hi>in fine</hi> I led <hi>Mahamed</hi> to the Princeſſes Lodging, for the which he was ſo obliged unto me, as that which the eyes of <hi>Axiamira</hi> had wrought in the heart of <hi>Deliment,</hi> and mine in that of the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> my courteſie effected in <hi>Mahameds;</hi> who from thence forward began to have an inclination for me, which might well be termed blinde, ſince if I had had any thing that was agreeable in my face, yet could he not have been touched with it, being not able to ſee it; and as for wit, I was in an age, which ordinarily is not capable of making great conqueſts. Indeed it is true, that my complying with him might render me pleaſing to him; for whereas all my fellows were not of my humor, they, when <hi>Mahamed</hi> was with <hi>Axiamira,</hi> declined his converſation, or at leaſt-wiſe applyed not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, and this, out of the thought, that being incapable of ſeeing their beauty, they beleeved him to be alſo incapable of love, and for this reaſon, they would not loſe that time with him, which they thought might be better employed in the entertaining of all thoſe young perſons of quality, which accompanyed the Princes to <hi>Axiamira.</hi> As for me, who cared not as yet, either for loving, or for being loved, I gave my ſelf onely to things that pleaſed me; and whereas I was infinitely taken with the converſation of Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and that generoſity it ſelf carryed me thereunto, I ſet my ſelf as often as I could to talk with him, but that which engaged me yet farther to this compliance, was, that the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> loved him dearly; for whereas <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Perca</hi> were unworthy of her affection, the firſt for the defects of his ſpirit, and the other for her malice, ſhe had placed all her liking on <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> ſo that when the Princeſs could not entertain him her ſelf, ſhe commanded me to ſtay with him, which I did with a great deal of joy, becauſe there was nothing of more power at that time in my minde, then the deſire to pleaſe the Princeſs, who in all her actions ſeemed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60144:126"/> to prefer me before all my fellows. On the other ſide the <hi>Sophi,</hi> who would fain know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would be as agreeable to his eyes in the Princeſſes Lodging, as he had found me in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama's;</hi> or whether the ſhining of ſo much light, and that chamber hung with black, had not ſerved to deceive him, uſed to come ſometimes to the Princeſſes, without giving me not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any greater mark of his affection, then to behold and commend me more then the reſt, when occaſion was preſented for it; for whereas I was very young at that time, he durſt not, as I underſtood afterwards, ſpeak plainly to me of his paſſion, fearing I ſhould not be diſcreet enough to conceal it from others. But whil'ſt he attended the improvement of my reaſon, the time, whereunto the ceremony of mourning had confined <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> being quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he came to render his duty to the Princeſſes, and to thank them for the honor they had done him; and whereas I was almoſt never abſent from <hi>Axiamira,</hi> he ſaw me in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and by a ſecond view confirmed himſelf in the advantageous opinion he had conceived of me; and ſo ſtrongly reſolved to love me, as fearing he ſhould be obliged to diſlodg from the Palace, becauſe the Princeſs his wife being dead without children, he was ſcarcely any longer of the royal Family; he purpoſed to endevor all he could to diſcover his affection unto me, for fear he ſhould be deprived of the commodity of doing it ſo eaſily, if he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to be gone from thence. As for me, I confeſs to you bluſhing, that in this viſit which he gave to the Princeſs, I felt a deſire ariſe in my heart that I might be pleaſing unto him; and without making any reflexion on this thought, I remember well, that although it had been a great Court that day, I never thought of heeding my apparel; but as ſoon as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was entred, I obſerved my ſelf with care, and without knowing any reaſon for it, I would have been glad that I had been better dreſt then I was. But <hi>in fine,</hi> my Lord, two or three hours after, Fortune was ſo favorable to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> deſign, as having found me alone in the Princeſſes Chamber, who was ſhut up in her Cabinet, he ſpake to me of his affection with ſo much paſſion, as I knew not what to anſwer him, having never met with ſuch like encounters. And whereas his ſpeech had ever ſince remained in my memory, and that it hath been the beginning and cauſe of all my pleaſure, and of all my miſery, I cannot forbear repeating it unto you. He no ſooner entred into the chamber, but I advanced towards him, to let him know that I was very ſorry for that he could not ſee the Princeſs as yet; and that having forbidden me interrupting her, I durſt not advertiſe her of his being there. Do not afflict you ſelf, fair <hi>Felixana,</hi> ſaid he unto me, for a thing which is infinitely pleaſing to me; and if you will render me perfectly happy, trouble not my good fortune in doubting of this truth. What, ſaid I unto him exceedingly ſurprized, do you come to ſee the Princeſs, and yet are glad that you cannot meet with her? truly this ſeems ſo ſtrange to me, as I cannot comprehend the reaſon of it. It is not for all that very difficult to finde out, anſwered he me, for I come to ſee the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> out of duty, and the beautiful <hi>Felixana</hi> out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: I am her ſubject, but I am your ſervant, and that in ſuch ſort, as you ſhall raign eternally in my ſoul, there being no kinde of ſervice which I will not render you with joy; and henceforth, continued he, receive, fair <hi>Felixana,</hi> all the duties which I ſhall tender to the Princeſs, as appertaining to you; and beleeve that I am raviſhed with finding you thus alone, whereby I have had the opportunity to make this Declaration unto you. This diſcourſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me in ſuch manner, as I ſhould have been much perplexed to have anſwered it, if <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amira</hi> had not at the ſame inſtant called me, ſo that being preſt to obey the Princeſs, all that I could do, was to tell him, that knowing him and my ſelf too, I ſhould always be able to diſcern how to beleeve that which was fit for me to beleeve, both for his glory, and mine. But, my Lord, without particularizing all theſe things unto you, it may ſuffice me to tell you, that in ſix months ſpace <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> gave me ſo many marks of his love and diſcretion, as I ſhould have been ingrateful and inſenſible, not to have rendred him ſome teſtimony of my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; and whereas I was neither the one nor the other, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> received from me all the proofs of friendſhip, which virtue could permit me to give him; and I may ſay that this was the onely time, wherein I lived with pleaſure. And truly I muſt confeſs that the life which I led was happy enough; I ſaw my ſelf favored by the moſt amiable perſon that ever was; careſſed by the <hi>Sophi;</hi> eſteemed of <hi>Mahamed;</hi> and paſſionately beloved of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who without contradiction, ſurpaſſed all that were at the Court in that bleſſed time.

Ah, my dear ſiſter, cryed the Prince, that I had my brothers eyes, or that he had <hi>Mahameds</hi> heart I you ſhould ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of this inſolent fellow; and the loſs of his life ſhould in a few days reſtore yours to its former tranquility. I know very well, replyed the Princeſs, that you are as generous as <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> is weak, and my ſiſter malicious: but <hi>in fine</hi> being able to do no other thing, you are to counſel me, and you and <hi>Felixana</hi> are to conſider well that the <hi>Sophi</hi> loves <hi>Deliment</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately; that he brought him not without ſome occaſion into my chamber; that although he be wicked, yet he hath wit; that conſequently he muſt needs know that his inſolence is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60144:127"/> by ſome body; that <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Perca</hi> are of his party; that they hate <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> becauſe he is of ours; that the <hi>Sophi</hi> our Father is not ſenſible of love to his children; and that the paſſions, which predominate in him, prevail with him over all things. Juſt hereupon we ſaw <hi>Iſmael, Perca,</hi> and all her women appear afar off, ſo that to ſhew there was no myſtery in our talk ſhe went to meet them, and going away prayed us, that we would fever our ſelves far from all others, to think of that ſhe had ſaid to us, and that in the Evening I ſhould tell her the reſolution we had taken. I led Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> then into another alley, where we were ſtill for all that in the ſight of the Princeſſes; and there, after we had well conſidered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we reſolved, that it was needful, before it ſhould break forth, to diſcover, whether the <hi>Sophi</hi> authorized the love of <hi>Deliment;</hi> whether <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Perca</hi> had any intelligence with him, or any intereſt in this love; that for this effect <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was to be made uſe of for ſo much as regarded the <hi>Sophi;</hi> and that I on my part ſhould endevor to know the ſecrets of <hi>Perca,</hi> by the means of a maid whom ſhe had loved very much, and who did not hate me; and that when we knew the truth of the buſineſs, it would be far more eaſie for us to remedy the ſame; for <hi>in fine,</hi> ſaid I, if the <hi>Sophi</hi> doth not protect <hi>Deliment,</hi> he will be loſt as ſoon as he underſtands of his inſolence; and if <hi>Perca</hi> be not intereſted in this affair, the diſcourſe which he hath uſed to the Princeſs will quickly make her change party, when ſhe knows it: but if the <hi>Sophi,</hi> as it is very likely, hath given ſome ſecret hopes to <hi>Deliment;</hi> and that <hi>Perca</hi> on the other ſide hath any ſhare in this adventure, it would be to no purpoſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain precipitouſly to them of the inſolence of this man, ſeeing they are the cauſe of it; and other remedies are to be ſought out. But Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſaid unto me, Is it poſſible that the <hi>Sophi</hi> (who heretofore, as I have underſtood, hath been ſo rigorous an obſerver of the Laws of this Empire, that he baniſhed the Satrap <hi>Arſalon,</hi> for marrying a maid that was not noble) ſhould ſo ſhamefully infringe them for him, in authorizing the love of <hi>Deliment?</hi> This is a thing, my Lord, ſaid I unto him, whereof we muſt be cleared by the way which I have ſhewed. This diſcourſe being finiſhed, and our reſolution taken, I perceived that we were a great way diſtant from the Princeſſes, ſo that turning the Prince about, he obſerved that I would reconduct him to a place, where he would not have the liberty to ſpeak unto me; wherefore ſtanding ſtill, and wringing me a little by the hand; go not ſo faſt, ſaid he unto me, amiable <hi>Felixana,</hi> and be pleaſed, that as <hi>Axiamira</hi> hath to day judged you worthy of communicating all her ſecrets unto you, ſo I may acquaint you with one of mine that concerns my life; to the end that our intereſts being ſo well joyned together, our party may be the more ſtronger, and our enemy the weaker. And when I had anſwered him, that it was eaſie for him to judg by my paſt actions of the deſire I had to ſerve him; you may well think, ſaid he unto me, according to the diſcourſe which my ſiſter uſed to me, that I ſhould lack reaſon, in making proteſtations of love unto you, were I not conſtrained thereunto by the force of truth and my paſſion. Proteſtations of love to me, my Lord, ſaid I? Yes, dear maid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he; and though I know very well, how it is an hard thing to beleeve, and hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that a blinde man, who cannot truly figure unto himſelf what Beauty is, ſhould be deſperately in love with you; yet is it certain that none hath ever been ſo much as I am, I hear all thoſe that come neer you, talk to you of the attracts of your eyes, of the beauty of your complexion, of your ſtature, and of your neck; but I hear none tell you, that your ſoul is fair, that your ſpirit is great and generous, that your goodneſs is extream, and that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion you are the moſt virtuous perſon that is in the world; yet is it with theſe beauties that my ſoul is touched; and they are they which doubtleſs render my love more ſtrong and more pure, then all thoſe, which, as I have heard ſay, are deſtroyed by the loſs of that beauty that is unknown to me. But that which I have for you ſhall certainly laſt as long as my life; for the beauty, diſcreet <hi>Felixana,</hi> which I adore in you, cannot be deſtroyed by time. If you be rigorous to me, continued he, I ſhall excuſe your rigor by the knowledg I have of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and if you be not ſo to me, I will ſet no bounds to your hopes, no more then to my affection. But in the mean time, ſaid he unto me, do me the grace to let me know, in what manner you will have me live with you. It is not for me, my Lord, anſwered I, to rule your life; but it is for me to rule my minde ſo, as to beleeve no more then I ought, and not to loſe the reſpect, which I have always rendred you. But, my Lord, added I, the firſt thing we are to think of is, to draw <hi>Axiamira</hi> out of the pain wherein I ſee her. That is my intent, replyed the Prince, and I have deſired to engage you the more ſtraitly in it, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60144:127"/> you know, that <hi>Deliment</hi> cannot reſolve to deſtroy me, without making you loſe the man, which in all the world loves you the moſt ardently, to the end that underſtanding the intereſt you have therein, you may employ your ſelf with the more care. I received this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with moderation enough, and a great deal of reſpect; as well becauſe the vertue of this Prince pleaſed me, as becauſe I knew he loved, and very much eſteemed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> and <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amira;</hi> but in ſuch ſort howſoever, as I engaged my ſelf to nothing. In the mean time we came to the Princeſſes, and with them we found <hi>Deliment,</hi> whom <hi>Iſmael</hi> had ſent for by the perſwaſion of <hi>Perca.</hi> As ſoon as he ſaw me neer to my fellows, he came to quarrel with me for having walked ſo long with the Prince, and ſeparating me from him, without any incivility, becauſe the Gentleman, that uſed to lead <hi>Mahamed,</hi> had lent him his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I quickly diſcerned by his diſcourſe, that there was a great intelligence between the <hi>Sophi</hi> and him: For as ſoon as he ſaw me alone, he began to tell me, that I was the happieſt perſon of my ſex, if I knew well how to manage the affection which the <hi>Sophi</hi> bore me; that he gave me this advice as my ſervant; and that if I pleaſed, he would ſerve me in it with all his power. I thanked him coldly enough for this offer, and told him, how I knew very well, that all my happineſs came from the <hi>Sophi,</hi> ſeeing the beautiful <hi>Axiamira</hi> made up all my felicity; and ſaying ſo, I returned to my fellows, which already were going after the Princes, and Princeſſes, who retired with very different thoughts. For <hi>Axiamira</hi> had her minde filled with choller and hate; <hi>Mahamed</hi> added to all thoſe things the love he bore to me; <hi>Perca</hi> thought to work ſo by her artifices, as we underſtood afterwards, that a man, who was of no great birth, ſhould marry her ſiſter, to the end ſhe might make uſe of it when time ſhould ſerve: <hi>Deliment</hi> imagined how he might deceive all the world for the ſatisfying of his love and his ambition; and <hi>Iſmael</hi> alone knew not very well what he was thinking on. As for me, I was ſo ſurprized with the inſolency of <hi>Deliment</hi> towards the Princeſs, of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Perca,</hi> of the love of <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and of that of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> as I could ſcarcely ſpeak. But <hi>in fine,</hi> my Lord, that I may not amuſe my ſelf too long about petty things, having ſuch great ones to tell you, you ſhall underſtand that we learned a little after, by the addreſs of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> by the intelligence which I got from <hi>Perca's</hi> confident, and by the innocency &amp; ſimplicity of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> all the ſeveral deſigns of theſe intereſſed perſons. As for the <hi>Sophi,</hi> the greateſt intereſt that he had in this affair, was only in my perſon; for though he durſt not ſpeak to me of his paſſion, for the reaſon I have alledged; yet was it ſo ſtrong, as he was conſtrain'd to diſcover it to <hi>Deliment,</hi> who promiſed him to ſpeak to me of it; and in caſe I ſhould not be diſcreet enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this ſecret from others, he would be ſo confident as to diſavow all that he had ſaid to me. For <hi>Deliment,</hi> he had a long time before won an old <hi>Satrap,</hi> in whom the <hi>Sophi</hi> very much confided for the affairs of the Empire, and who had oftentimes perſwaded him by <hi>Deliment's</hi> direction, that the Law, which had cauſed <hi>Arſalon</hi> to be baniſhed, was very judiciouſly made for his ſubjects, but not for him; perſwading him, that Kings, which did not marry their daughters to forraign Princes, were never to admit the nobleſt and the greateſt of their ſubjects into their alliance; becauſe that moſt commonly was to take Tutors, in taking ſons in law of an high birth; and that for the good of the Prince, of the State, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, it would be better to do otherwiſe. For, ſaid he unto him one day, coming to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, if by example, the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> had marryed <hi>Deliment,</hi> what a felicity would yours be, to have a ſon-in-law, that ſhould owe all his glory to you, and abſolutely depend on you? and what an happineſs would it be for <hi>Axiamira</hi> to have an husband, without having a maſter? it being certain, that the inequality of their conditions would always keep <hi>Deliment</hi> in the terms of duty and obedience. With ſuch like reaſons as theſe it was, that this wicked man had cauſed the minde of the <hi>Sophi</hi> to be prepared before he would diſcover his love unto him. But whereas he had underſtood by his Agent, that he had not reject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He ſpake this to him with ſo much cunning, as he deſigned <hi>Axiamira</hi> unto him, yet without engaging himſelf ſo far, but that he might interpret his diſcourſe after another manner, if he perceived the <hi>Sophi</hi> to be offended at it. But he had too much need of him for me, and his minde was too much poſſeſt with maxims
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60144:128"/> of State, which were advantageous to <hi>Deliment,</hi> for him to be ſo: and indeed far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpleaſed with it, he embraced, and told him, that his hopes might go ſo high, as that he permitted him to lift up his eyes, even to the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira.</hi> For, ſaid he unto him, ſince Nature hath not given me children, which can govern this Empire, I would be willing that love and fortune would give me ſuch a one as <hi>Deliment,</hi> who may, if not be <hi>Sophi</hi> after me, at leaſt-wiſe counſel him that ſhall be. <hi>Deliment,</hi> cunning and dextrous as he was, made as though he did not beleeve that which the <hi>Sophi</hi> ſaid to him, and out of a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But when as <hi>Deliment</hi> continued ſaying, that reſpect was ſtronger in him then all other things, the <hi>Sophi,</hi> that he might know whether it were <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> indeed whom he was in love withall, carryed him to her lodging; and it was then that this raſh man was ſo audacious, as to ſpeak with ſuch inſolency to the Princeſs. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had tryed that love could not move her, he beleeved that ambition might; and that the hope of reigning over <hi>Perſia</hi> would move her more, then the certainty wherein ſhe was of reigning over his heart. As for the Princeſs <hi>Perca,</hi> they had a long time before treated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he had perſwaded her, that the Crown of <hi>Perſia</hi> was to be ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when he made a ſhew of ſeeking out, who in the Court might be <hi>Axiamira's</hi> husband, he play'd his part ſo well, that he led her, as cunning as ſhe was, to the point he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.

But at length, being come to agreement about their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they judged, that albeit <hi>Iſmael</hi> was not capable of rendering a party much ſtronger then if he were not of it, yet it would be advantageous for them to ſeize upon his ſpirit; and <hi>Perca</hi> took the care to do it. As indeed, ſhe eaſily perſwaded him, that it was requiſite <hi>Axiamira</hi> ſhould be marryed to a man that depended on him, and not on <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who after the death of the <hi>Sophi</hi> might trouble him, in demanding a great portion, as if he were not blind; ſo that to weaken his party, it would be good to marry <hi>Axiamira</hi> to <hi>Deliment,</hi> who would tye himſelf wholly to his intereſts. Behold, my Lord, the motives and the cauſes of <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's</hi> inſolency to <hi>Axiamira;</hi> of the diſcourſes which he made to me touching the love of the <hi>Sophi;</hi> of the perſwaſions of <hi>Perca</hi> and <hi>Iſmael;</hi> and of the unquietneſs, which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing entanglement gave us.

I offered the Princeſs to retire to my father under pretext of a ſuppoſed ſickneſs, but if the good-will which ſhe bore me oppoſed it, Prince <hi>Mahameds</hi> love hindred it abſolutely: In regard whereof they repreſented unto me, that if I ſhould do ſo, it would be the undoing of all, becauſe if the <hi>Sophi</hi> did love me, he would be ſo incenſed thereby, as he might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be carryed to a violence, which otherwiſe he would not be capable of.

And at the ſame time certain Merchants came thither alſo, who, amongſt other rarities, which they had, made ſhew of a number of the pictures of the faireſt women of ſuch ſeveral Nations, as they had paſſed through. Theſe two things joyned together, cauſed the <hi>Sophi,</hi> out of the deſign he had to oblige me, to give command that all the maidens of quality, which were at the Court, ſhould preſent themſelves at his Palace on a certain day, appointed for it, together with the Princeſſes and their maids, ſumptuouſly apparelled. This ceremony, whereof we knew not the cauſe (for they made a ſecret of it) ſomewhat troubled us, but at length that day being arrived, and all this fair Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly compleated, the <hi>Sophi</hi> followed by <hi>Iſmael, Mahamed, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama, Deliment,</hi> and the Painter, of whom I have ſpoken to you, entred into the room, where we were all ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but without the Princeſſes holding the rank, which they ought to have had, for ſo had the <hi>Sophi</hi> ordained it; and that which alſo redoubled the impatience we were in, to know for what reaſon they had cauſed us to be attired ſo richly, was, to ſee the <hi>Sophi</hi> hold in his right hand two Crowns of gold ſet with Diamonds, and taking the Painter with his left hand, whom neither the Princeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is certain that I bluſht at this diſcourſe, and that lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my eyes again, I encountred <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's,</hi> wherein I marked ſo much unquietneſs, as it pityed me exceedingly. Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> was cloſe by him, who not able to ſee but with others eyes, demanded ſoftly of him, what they were doing: But at laſt, when the Painter, for ceremonies ſake, had ſeparated twelve from the reſt, whereof the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> and I were two; and that the <hi>Sophi</hi> had willed him once again to be equal; whether it were that <hi>Tachmas</hi> had made me known to the Painter, without my perceiving it, as in all likelyhood he had; or whether he was not very knowing in beauty, I was the firſt that was declared victorious, and on whoſe head the <hi>Sophi</hi> ſet one of the Crowns. But whereas I knew very well, that this victory was an effect rather of the <hi>Soph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'s</hi> love, then of my beauty, it brought me more ſpight then joy; ſo that taking the Crown, which had been given me, I went to place it at the feet of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Sophi,</hi> by the ſentence of the Painter, ſet the other on her head. But he, ſeeing this action of mine, took that which I was going to place on the ground, and giving it me again a ſecond time; Is it, ſaid he unto me, for that the Crown which I offer you is not beautiful enough? or that the hand which preſents it to you is not illuſtrious enough? It is neither the one nor the other, my Lord, anſwered I, but it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60144:129"/> becauſe I am neither beautiful, nor illuſtrious enough, to wear a Crown, that parts from the hand of ſo great a Prince. And then coming nearer to me, Receive this ſame, ſaid he to me ſoftly, fair maid, and beleeve, if you will be reaſonable, that this ſhall not be the laſt you ſhall receive from me. All the anſwer I made to this diſcourſe was onely bluſhing, and ſo I ſhuffled in my ſelf amongſt my fellows, with as much diſpleaſure for my victory, as they had vexation for that they had not carryed it. But in concluſion, my Lord, <hi>Axiamira</hi> and I were painted in the habit of <hi>Amazons,</hi> which, as he ſaid who drew our pictures, was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Nations: When they were done, the <hi>Sophi</hi> cauſed him to make ſix copies of each of us, which he put into Caſes of Gold, enriched with Diamonds, and gave them to thoſe Merchants, who had ſhew'd him ſo many forraign beauties; but with an oath, that they ſhould never ſell them to any but Princes, and that they ſhould always reſerve one of each of them in their own keeping, to publiſh <hi>Axiamira's</hi> beauty and mine over all the Countries through which they travelled. Theſe Merchants promiſed all that he required, and for our ill fortune kept their word but too well, as you ſhall underſtand hereafter. From that ſame day <hi>Deliment</hi> perſecuted me more then ordinary, it ſeeming unto him that I was no longer to doubt of the <hi>Sophi's</hi> love, after that which he had ſaid unto me. And whereas I deſired to decline his encounter, as much as I could, I ſtood oftentimes talking with Prince <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> becauſe though he contemned him, yet his quality made him that he durſt not ſeparate me from him, when we were in diſcourſe together. And I remember that one day, as this poor Prince was entertaining me, and that <hi>Deliment</hi> was come to the Princeſſes with <hi>Iſmael,</hi> out of a deſign to ſay ſomething to me from the <hi>Sophi,</hi> this inſolent man did ſo far loſe the reſpect which he owed to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as I hated him for it more then I did before. I have already told you bluſhing, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that this Prince was in love with me; and though I had nothing but good-will for him, and that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> abſolutely poſſeſſed my heart, yet did I in ſome ſort comply with <hi>Mahamed,</hi> for his diſcourſe was ſo virtuous, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, though paſſionate, as if <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had heard it, I verily think he could not have hated this illuſtrious Rival. I was alſo willing to conſerve the good-will of the ſon, out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent I had to refuſe the love of the father. It was then with his paſſion that <hi>Mahamed</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me that day, when as <hi>Deliment</hi> had ſo great a deſire to ſpeak with me, and that finding himſelf hindred from it by the Princes preſence, he thought good to obſerve both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas it is hard for the motions of the face not to give ſome marks of thoſe of the heart, eſpecially when love poſſeſſeth it; <hi>Deliment</hi> perceived ſomething which was extraordinary in that of the Prince; for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> albeit he was blinde, yet came up cloſe to me, as if he could have ſeen me; and becauſe his eyes could not advertiſe him when there was any one neer us that could hear him, and that it would have but put me in remembrance of his defect if he ſhould have ſaid any thing to me of it, he always uſed to ſpeak ſoftly unto me; which that day, amongſt others, gave no little unquietneſs to <hi>Deliment;</hi> for having marked that I had bluſht twice or thrice, and it ſeeming to him to be without anger, he ſuſpected ſomewhat of the truth. And whereas he was inſolent, and accuſtomed to a bitter jeering, which made him to be yet more hated of every one, he ſaid, ſpeaking of me, to <hi>Perca</hi>'s Confident, who was hard by him (for thoſe two Princeſſes were retired into <hi>Axiamira's</hi> Cabinet, accompanyed by <hi>Iſmael,</hi>) doth not this ſo long and ſo particular a converſation poſſeſs you with curioſity? for as for me, continued he, I profeſs unto you that I cannot comprehend it. If it be of indifferent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

Deliment</hi> ſpake ſo ſoftly, as I could not hear him; but whereas the privation of ſight ſeemed to have redoubled in <hi>Mahamed</hi> the delicacy of hearing, he loſt not one word of that which I have delivered. I perceived very well, that upon a ſudden he had held his peace, that he had bluſhed, and that without harkening to me he had lent an ear to <hi>Deliment;</hi> but I was much ſurprized, when as turning him towards the place where he heard him ſpeak, he ſaid unto him with a ſtrong and confident voyce: Thou thinkeſt it may be, inſolent as thou art, that becauſe I am blinde, I ſhould be deaf alſo; howbeit know, that I have but too well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60144:129"/> heard, for thy intereſt, the injurious words which thou haſt ſpoken; for though I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſight, I have not loſt my courage; and did not the reſpect of <hi>Axiamira</hi> retain me, I would ſtrangle thee with mine own hands, or thy flight ſhould ſhelter thee from my fury; but what ſay I, continued he, thou knoweſt well, baſe man, that I could not follow thee, and that is it which makes thee ſo audacious. <hi>Deliment</hi> during this diſcourſe did nothing but ſmile, which ſo incenſed me, as I could not forbear beholding him with rage; but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry inſolency to the higheſt point, he told <hi>Mahamed,</hi> that he had ſaid nothing of him, which he might not ſay again to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> without offending him. I do not think, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Mahamed,</hi> that he would be as unjuſt to authorize thy inſolency to me, as to <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira;</hi> but howſoever, get thee out of this lodging, and never come into the place where I am, I charge thee. I aſſure you, anſwered <hi>Deliment</hi> as he was going away, that you ſhall never ſee me more. This laſt jeer ſo mightily incenſed <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as he would have gone to that part where he heard the voyce of <hi>Deliment;</hi> but knowing that his misfortune would not permit his coming at him to puniſh his audaciouſneſs, I retained him the beſt I could; and not thinking of <hi>Perca's</hi> Confident being there, Let this ſenſleſs fellow go, my Lord, ſaid I unto him, and conſider that your hand is too noble to puniſh his arrogance; and that in ſtead of doing him an affront, you will do him an honor, whereof he is not worthy. At this noiſe the Princeſſes opened the Cabinet, and <hi>Axiamira</hi> asking what the matter was, ſaw Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> exceedingly moved; It is, anſwered he, an inſolency of <hi>Deliments,</hi> which I may not tell you ſo ſuddenly; for, my dear ſiſter, thoſe of his party are yet too ſtrong here. <hi>Perca</hi> ſeeming not to underſtand that this diſcourſe was addreſſed to her, I aſſure my ſelf, ſaid this ſubtle Princeſs, that this was one of <hi>Deliment's</hi> merriments, which the Prince hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood; but leſt this diſorder, continued ſhe, ſhould oblige the <hi>Sophi</hi> to forbid the Princes from bringing any body to our lodging, I will go and endevor to appeaſe this tempeſt. Spare that pain, replyed <hi>Mahamed;</hi> for certainly, on my part, it ſhall never be appeaſed but with the death of <hi>Deliment.</hi> But <hi>Perca,</hi> without anſwering this diſcourſe, took <hi>Iſmael</hi> by the land, and all amazed as he was, carryed him away whither ſhe pleaſed.

The Princeſs, who perceived that in ſtead of being appeaſed, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> grew the more incenſed with talking, made him enter into her Cabinet with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> and me; where we no ſooner were, but ſhe beginning to ſpeak, aſſured <hi>Mahamed,</hi> that ſhe was no leſs ſenſible of <hi>Deliment's</hi> inſolency then he; that ſhe promiſed never to marry him, not, ſaid ſhe, becauſe I would have you obliged to me for it, or that you ſhould think I do it for the love of you, but contrarily, I deſire you would beleeve, that when <hi>Deliment</hi> ſhewed the moſt love and reſpect to me, I would ſtill have made choyce of death, rather then be his wife; for <hi>in fine,</hi> his birth, his humor, his wickedneſs, and his arrogance, have poſſeſſed me with ſo much hatred againſt him, as there is no extremity, whereunto I will not be carryed, rather then conſent to any thing that may pleaſe him. But that which I deſire you ſhould

Ah! generous ſiſter (ſaid <hi>Mahamed,</hi> interrupting her, and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with hearing her ſpeak ſo) I was perſwaded, that my quarrel ſhould be yours, and that you would not abandon me. When as I ſaw that their diſcourſe reſolved on nothing, I told them, that without amuſing themſelves about giving teſtimonies of their affection one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which was to no purpoſe, ſince it could not be doubted of, it would be better for them to employ the time in conſidering, whether <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſhould complain to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> or whether he ſhould ſtay, to ſee in what manner <hi>Deliment</hi> would live with him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after he had forbidden him his pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ence. This advice ſeeming juſt unto them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to examine the matter. As for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> he would neither complain, nor ſtay, but onely revenge himſelf. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who foreſaw that no good could come of this revenge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Prince, or for the Princeſs, or for himſelf, ſtay'd till <hi>Axiamira</hi> had delivered her opinion, pretending that he was not to ſpeak his, in regard, ſaid he, that it belonged onely to him to execute that which the Princeſs and <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſhould reſolve upon. So that <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amira</hi> being unwilling to ſpeak alone by her ſelf, commanded me to ſay what I thought was fit to be done in this affair. I confeſs to you, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that notwithſtanding the hate which I bare to <hi>Deliment,</hi> I adviſed, that things ſhould be gently carryed; and that if he came to ſubmit himſelf to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> he ſhould be received, and ſhew made of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; but upon condition nevertheleſs, that he ſhould appear as ſeldom as he might in places where <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſhould be. And that which carryed me hereunto, was the thought, that if <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> enterprized any thing againſt <hi>Deliment,</hi> the leaſt that could arrive unto me by it would be, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> would be conſtrained to abſent himſelf, and leave me in the power of the <hi>Sophi.</hi> As for the Princeſs, ſhe was of the opinion, that a gentleman ſhould be ſent from <hi>Mahamed</hi> to complain to the <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Deliments</hi> inſolency; and that withall great care ſhould be taken to publiſh it, becauſe, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> it will be requiſite to make him be contemned and hated of every one, as much as poſſibly we can, that we make uſe of that hatred and contempt when time ſhall ſerve; for, continued ſhe, the world is not acquainted with his temerity and audaciouſneſs; and whereas he is rich and liberal, he hath partiſans and ſervants, who durſt not declare themſelves to be ſo, if they knew that you and I did hate him. Why, ſiſter, replyed <hi>Mahamed,</hi> would you have me publiſh, that I have received an affront with impunity? Yes, ſaid ſhe, I would have it publiſhed, that you may be revenged of <hi>Deliment,</hi> ſeeing you may do it without offence to your reputation. Conſider, added ſhe, that if the generoſity of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſhould carry him to fight with <hi>Deliment,</hi> your revenge would be doubtful, ſince you cannot be ignorant, that the ſucceſs of Arms is always ſo, and if peradventure it ſhould coſt you the blood and fortune of ſo excellent a man, you would repent you of this violence. No, Madam, ſaid <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> interrupting her, never ſtand on theſe conſiderations; ſeeing my fortune, my blood, and my life, could not be employed more gloriouſly, then in revenging Prince <hi>Mahamed.</hi> But, replyed ſhe, the matter is not ſo eaſie as you imagine; your deſign may be diſcovered; the opportunity of executing it perchance will not be preſented; and then to ſpeak freely unto you, I cannot approve of that violence in <hi>Mahamed,</hi> which I ſhould condemn in others. It will be better then to lay the blame on the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Deliment</hi> in a gentle way; and procure him ſecret Enemies, who when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall require, and that we would openly oppoſe his violences, may ſerve us with courage, and give us the means to be revenged, without fear, and with honor. In brief, this ſage Princeſs maintained her opinion with ſo many reaſons, as it was followed: And to execute it, I went to give order for the fetching of an old Governor, who had brought up <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> and that was one of the wiſeſt and underſtandingeſt men of our age, to the end he might go to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> who whil'ſt we were taking our reſolution entertained <hi>Deliment.</hi> For as ſoon as he was gone out of <hi>Axiamira's</hi> chamber he went unto that of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> to whom for the colouring of his inſolency he ſaid, that finding me every day more rebellious to his will, he could think no other, but that my heart was engaged other-where; and that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved all my actions, he had found that Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> did not hate me; that to be the better cleared thereof, and carryed by the zeal which he had to his ſervice, he had ſpoken ſome jeſting words, whil'ſt the Prince entertained me, which he had taken ſo ill, as his anger thereupon did perſwade him the more to that opinion of his. It is not, ſaid he ſmiling, (as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60144:130"/> we underſtood afterwards) becauſe it may be eaſily imagined, that the beauty of <hi>Felixana</hi> hath given you a rival; but howſoever I would not conceal my ſuſpicion from you, and it is for you to make my peace with Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> if you will not have the beautiful <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> hate me. I will take the care of that upon me, replyed the <hi>Sophi;</hi> and beleeve that I am not a little obliged unto you, in that you have not feared to anger <hi>Mahamed,</hi> for to ſerve me in a thing, whereon my felicity depends. Judg, my Lord, whether after this artifice, the complaints of this poor Prince were well received or no. The <hi>Sophi</hi> nevertheleſs deſired to keep ſome <hi>decorum,</hi> being unable to beleeve that <hi>Mahamed</hi> was amorous, though he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to clear himſelf further therein. As ſoon then as that ancient Governor of <hi>Mahamed</hi> had made his complaint, he told him, that he was already advertiſed of the matter; and that to give ſatisfaction to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> he commanded him to pardon <hi>Deliment,</hi> whoſe heart he well knew, and was ſure that he had no purpoſe to offend him, and that it had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a light temptation, to ſay ſome merriment. And when that Governor would have beſought him, that at leaſt-wiſe <hi>Deliment</hi> ſhould not come, but as ſeldom as he could, to the places where Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſhould be; the <hi>Sophi</hi> bid him make no further reply, for he would be obeyed; and for that effect he would go and carry <hi>Deliment</hi> to <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the end that in the ſame place, where the fault had been committed, it might alſo be pardoned; ſo that when we expected the <hi>Sophi's</hi> anſwer, we ſaw him himſelf enter, leaning on <hi>Deliment,</hi> and followed by <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Perca,</hi> who not having ſeen <hi>Deliment</hi> ſince her going forth, becauſe he was with the <hi>Sophi,</hi> ſhe had followed them to this ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as ſoon as ſhe had been advertiſed that they came thither. I leave you to judg, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this viſit did not poſſeſs <hi>Mahamed</hi> with choller, and <hi>Axiamira</hi> and me with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But we were yet in much more, when as the <hi>Sophi</hi> fell to amplifie the obligations which he had to <hi>Deliment,</hi> his virtues, his merit, the affection he bare to the Princes and Princeſſes; and <hi>in fine,</hi> continued he, the greateſt mark that can be given me of the paſſion one is in for my ſervice, is, to render the ſame honors to <hi>Deliment,</hi> as if he were my ſon; and as for you, ſaid he, leaning on <hi>Mahamed's</hi> ſhoulder, I command you to love <hi>Deliment,</hi> and to live well with him. It would be methinks more juſt, replyed the Prince, that you would ordain him not to affront me, ſince he cannot do ſo without offending you. I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, anſwered the <hi>Sophi,</hi> the ill opinion you have of <hi>Deliment,</hi> ſeeing it is not occaſioned but by the little knowledg you have of his intentions. But howſoever I will be obeyed; and without examining whether my pleaſure be unjuſt or equitable, I command you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ſubmiſſions and his friendſhip. Hereupon <hi>Deliment</hi> began to ſpeak, and diſguiſing the malice of his ſoul, he ſaid ſo many obliging things to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as if he had not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known his wickedneſs, he might have beleeved that he was capable of repenting. So it was, that <hi>Mahamed</hi> was conſtrained to make ſhew of no longer reſenting the offence he had received. This peace brought great joy to <hi>Perca;</hi> but <hi>Axiamira's</hi> coldneſs made it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough that they were not both of one party. The <hi>Sophi</hi> continued yet ſome time in talking of indifferent things, during the which he ſtill fixed his eyes on my face: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as out of a ſenſe of compaſſion, and to avoyd his looks, I turned my head all that while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Mahamed,</hi> he began to think that there might be ſome verity in <hi>Deliments</hi> ſuſpicion. He was no ſooner returned to his lodging, but thinking of the means to be cleared therein, he conceived that the gentleman, who ſerved to guide <hi>Mahamed,</hi> might peradventure be he from whom he might learn ſomething. He had no ſooner communicated this deſign to <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but that having approved of it, he thought of nothing elſe then executing it. And to that purpoſe he waited, that he might give no ſuſpicion to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> till he was retired in the Evening, for at that time the Prince not uſing to ſtir forth any more, always left his guide at liberty; <hi>Deliment,</hi> who had cauſed him to be watched, was no ſooner advertiſed that he was come out of the Princes chamber, but he made him be ſecretly told, that the <hi>Sophi</hi> would ſpeak with him. This man, who had not been accuſtomed to receive ſuch like favors, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obeyed; and the <hi>Sophi,</hi> joyning the hope of a great fortune, preſents, and entreaties, to his commands, had quickly ſuborned his fidelity. After then that he was well aſſured of him, both by reaſon of the things I have ſpoken of, and of the fear of puniſhment if he f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his promiſe, he commanded him exactly to obſerve all Prince <hi>Mahamed's</hi> actions, to take good notice of what he ſpake of me; to endevor to learn ſomething thereof; and to give him an account of it every Evening at the ſame hour. And when he preſſed him to tell
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60144:131"/> him, whether he had not perceived that there was ſome intelligence between the Prince and me, he anſwered him, that he knew no more thereof, but that the Prince ſpake oftener of me, then of any other of my fellows. But whil'ſt they were betraying him in this ſort, he was not without unquietneſs; The ſpight to be ſo ill entreated by the <hi>Sophi,</hi> and ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily affronted by <hi>Deliment,</hi> without having an aſſured mean to be revenged of it, put him into no little pain: And then again, when he came to think, that the next day he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with <hi>Deliment</hi> again at <hi>Axiamira's</hi> lodging, his great heart could not ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon ſo grievous a thing; he purpoſed then, for the declining of it, to make a ſhew of being ſick, and not to ſtir out of his chamber a good while. But when he came to conſider, that in declining the encounter of <hi>Deliment,</hi> he ſhould deprive himſelf of mine, love was ſtronger in him then ſpight; and the converſation of his Enemy was not ſo redoubtable, as the hope of mine was ſweet unto him. Howbeit imagining, that the Princeſs would viſit him during his feigned ſickneſs, and that I, being her Confident, would not fail to accompany her thither, ſpight re-aſſumed its former place, and made him execute his reſolution. The next day he feigned himſelf ſick, and would let no body ſee him; but fearing leſt <hi>Axiamira</hi> ſhould be troubled at it, he ſent her word, that ſhe ſhould not be diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, aſſuring her, that the greateſt remedy he had need of was her converſation, or to be alone. The Princeſs underſtood well enough what the Prince deſired of her, ſo that as ſoon as ſhe had met with occaſion fit for it, ſhe went to ſee <hi>Mahamed,</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none with her but an old Governeſs, one of my fellows, and me. But <hi>Perca,</hi> having underſtood that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was gone to ſee Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who was not well, perſwaded <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Deliment</hi> to go thither too; ſo that we were hardly arrived at <hi>Mahamed's</hi> chamber, but we were advertiſed, that this Enemy troop was coming to trouble our reſt. The Prince was ſo enraged at it, as <hi>Axiamira,</hi> fearing he ſhould be carryed to ſome violence, made haſte to be gone, ſo that meeting them in the anti-chamber, where ſhe ſtay'd them, ſhe told them that the Prince being aſleep, ſhe would not ſuffer him to be awaked, and thereby obliged them to return. In the mean time <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who could not forbear giving me to underſtand, that he lived ſtill for me, called to him his guide, named <hi>Amariel,</hi> who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerved him alſo for a Secretary. He recommends ſecrecy and diſcretion to him, and after he had made him ſwear an hundred falſe oaths, he dictates a letter unto him for me, which he wrote very faithfully; And having cauſed him to read it over more then once unto him, he gives him order to go the next morning for to know how the Princeſs does, and then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me that letter as ſecretly as he could. <hi>Amariel</hi> promiſes to acquit himſelf thereof as he ought; and very glad of his adventure, he retires from the Prince, and goes with all ſpeed to do an act of fidelity to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> and of treachery to <hi>Mahamed.</hi> The <hi>Sophi</hi> careſſes him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, and taking the letter with very much impatience, he ſees that it was extreamly paſſionate, and that <hi>Deliment's</hi> ſuſpicions were not ill grounded. He ſent immediately for him, ſhewed him the letter which he had, and exceedingly moved with choller, demanded what counſel he ſhould take? <hi>Deliment,</hi> as more cunning, and leſs preoccupated, told him, how by this letter well conſidered one migh eaſily ſee, that <hi>Mahamed</hi> was paſſionately in love with me, but that one could not judg, whether I anſwered his paſſion or no; ſo that to be cleared therein, <hi>Amariel</hi> was to deliver this letter to me, and crave an anſwer of it. That for his part, he beleeved that I did not hate him, becauſe one of <hi>Perca's</hi> maids had heard me ſay ſomewhat, as ſhe went out of <hi>Axiamira's</hi> chamber, that made him think ſo. This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution being taken, <hi>Amariel</hi> according to his directions came unto me, rendred me <hi>Mahameds</hi> letter, and gave me the commodity to anſwer it. For whereas he was come very early, the Princeſs was not yet awake, and I was ſtill in my chamber, without any other company then a maid that waited on me. Until then, I had beleeved, that I was not obliged to let <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> know any thing of Prince <hi>Mahamed's</hi> love; but when I foreſaw that it was like to have ſome ſequel, I reſolved, when I could finde a favorable occaſion, to ſay ſomething to him of it; and in the mean time ſo to live with <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as he ſhould have no cauſe to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, nor yet hope to engage me to the affection which he deſired of me. I anſwered him with a great deal of reſpect, and turning the ſence of his words as dextrouſly as I could, I anſwered to a letter of love, as if it had been a letter of friendſhip. <hi>Amariel</hi> had no ſooner gotten mine anſwer, but he went away very well ſatisfied to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> who was not ſorry to ſee, that I had not ſo much affection for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> but that he might hope to be able to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60144:131"/> break it. He conſulted then with his ordinary counſel, that is to ſay with <hi>Deliment,</hi> and they reſolved together, that from thence forward they would change the Letters which the Prince ſhould cauſe to be written to me, becauſe for ſo much as they could judg by that which they had ſeen, they would be too well endited, and too paſſionate; purpoſing alſo, if it fell out that I ſhould anſwer him too obligingly, not to let it be read ſo to Prince <hi>Mahamed:</hi> who, as if fortune would be aſſiſtant to our Enemies, became ſo ſick indeed, as he was fain to keep his chamber fifteen days together; In which time, there paſt not a day, wherein he did not write unto me, and I did not anſwer him, without ever knowing for all that what we ſaid one to another; becauſe the <hi>Sophi</hi> retained all <hi>Mahamed's</hi> Letters, and cauſed others to be written to me; and likewiſe kept all my anſwers, in making me ſpeak as he pleaſed. I confeſs, that many times I marvelled at the queſtions, wherewith thoſe Letters, which I beleeved were <hi>Mahamed's,</hi> were filled: and confronting the firſt I received from him with the reſt, I found ſo great a difference between them, were it for the gracefulneſs of the ſtile, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the things he ſaid to me, as I knew not what to think of it. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing it was always the ſame hand, and receiving them the ſame way, all I could conclude upon it was, That the blindneſs of this poor Prince poſſeſſed him with ſuch thoughts for love, as never any body had the like but he. For whereas the <hi>Sophi's</hi> and <hi>Deliment's</hi> deſign was, to render <hi>Mahamed</hi> contemptible to me, they made him write ſtrange things by <hi>Amariel.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they made this blinde Prince ſay, that he was grieved he did not ſee me; that the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my eyes was always preſent before him; in another Letter, that for the more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity he would willingly that I had been blinde as he was, and the rather for that then I ſhould not ſee the <hi>Sophi,</hi> whom he knew to be his Rival. In another, he conjured me to let him have my picture, and to ſend him word whether I were fair or brown. I leave you to think, ſince I could not deſpiſe <hi>Mahamed,</hi> becauſe I eſteemed him very much other-ways, whether theſe Letters did not move me to compaſſion; and though <hi>Deliment's</hi> cunning did always intermix ſomething of the <hi>Sophi</hi> among, yet I had always ſo much diſcretion, or good hap, as not to make any anſwer to that particular. But if <hi>Deliment</hi> drew up ſuch ſenſleſs Letters for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> thoſe which he made for me, as I underſtood afterwards, were not much more reaſonable. And the Prince hath told me, that when <hi>Amariel</hi> read them to him, he could not chuſe but make him read them over again and again. It was not becauſe <hi>Deliment,</hi> who ordinarily dictated them, had made them very obliging, but becauſe the Prince, finding them ſo badly pen'd, was perſwaded that it was <hi>Amariel's</hi> fault, who read them ill; for he could not imagine, that a perſon, whoſe wit ſeemed worthy of his eſteem, ſhould expreſs her thoughts with ſo bad a grace; and to that effect, he made him read them over many times, that he might be able to diſcern the faults of the Reader, from thoſe which they made to paſs for mine.</p>
                  <p>But whil'ſt the malice of <hi>Deliment</hi> triumphed over the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s facility, and our innocency, <hi>Mahamed</hi> being well amended, cauſed himſelf to be led to the Princeſſes lodging, to render her his firſt viſit, or to ſay better, to have a pretext to give me one. For he hath told me ſince, how he was not without impatience to hear me talk, to the end he might know, whether I had ſtill the ſame wit, which he had ſo much prized in me. He did not marvel, that I had always anſwered him with rigor enough, becauſe he might well think that mine own vertue, and the fear of committing my ſelf to the diſcretion of him that was to read my Letters, would carry me thereunto; but to ſay things from the purpoſe to him, was that which he could not comprehend. As long as his ſickneſs had laſted, the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> had been often enough to viſit him, but <hi>Perca</hi> had moſt commonly been in her company, ſo that we ſpake not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until that coming, as I have ſaid, one morning to viſit <hi>Axiamira,</hi> with a purpoſe, if he found her alone, to declare to her the paſſion which he was in for me; not finding her yet awake, and making as though he would attend till ſhe was, he cauſed himſelf to be led to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; when he came thither, I had almoſt done reading a Letter from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who, provoked by the force of his paſſion, and the fear he was in leſt the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s love ſhould prevail with me more then his, conjured me to remember the promiſes which I had made him; <hi>never to love any but him;</hi> and conſequently, paſſed over again all the teſtimonies of affection which I had rendred him, that ſo he might oblige me not to deprive him of it.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, when <hi>Mahamed</hi> entred into my chamber, I thought to have hid the Letter which I held, but ſuddenly calling to minde that he was blinde, I laughed at my providence, and ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60144:132"/> much the more, for that he had commanded <hi>Amariel</hi> to ſtay in a gallery, through which one was to paſs for to come into my chamber. When I ſaw my ſelf alone with <hi>Mahamed,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were a maid that ſerved me, and in whom I confided in all things, I was taken with ſuch impatience to make an end of reading <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, as preſently after the firſt civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I began to unfold it as ſoftly as poſſibly I could, and without anſwering preciſely to <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s diſcourſes I read that which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> writ unto me. <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who certainly hath a great deal of underſtanding, and that according to the cuſtom of the blinde is always a little ſuſpicious, though out of diſcretion he makes as little ſhew of it as may be, hearing the noiſe which the Letter made in turning it from the one ſide to the other, (for it was indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent long) imagined that there was ſome myſtery in it which he did not comprehend; that peradventure the <hi>Sophi</hi> had during his ſickneſs abſolutely gained me, and that the paper, which I held, and whereof he heard the noiſe, was a Letter from him, or from <hi>Deliment;</hi> In ſo grievous a thought, this ſo wiſe and ſo moderate a Prince could not reſiſt the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of clearing himſelf of a doubt, which gave him ſo much unquietneſs; ſo that at ſuch time as I never dream'd of it, and that I was folding up <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter again, and deeply muſing on that which I had read, <hi>Mahamed</hi> directing his hand by the noiſe which I made in doing it up, chance led it ſo juſt where it ſhould be, that he ſnatched it from me ſooner then I was able to withſtand him. <hi>I muſt needs know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>amiable</hi> Felixana, <hi>whether this bleſſed Paper, which hath kept you from anſwering me, merits the honor you do it to my prejudice. My Lord,</hi> ſaid I unto him exceedingly troubled, <hi>if you could ſee what is in this Letter, I would not reſiſt your pleaſure; but ſince you cannot know what it is but by a third perſon, permit that I may conjure you to render it me.</hi> This extream earneſtneſs that I ſhewed to draw that Paper out of his hands was that which provoked his curioſity the more; and though he did infinitely fear to diſpleaſe me, yet did he fear much more to be over-reached. And then again, beleeving <hi>Amariel</hi> to be very faithful, he thought he ſhould hazard nothing, in reſolving to let him read it. In this opinion the more I importuned him, the more did he defend himſelf from according that which I required; and I verily beleeve that in ſo great a trouble I ſhould have told him the truth of the matter, and confided in his generoſity, if <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment,</hi> who had been advertiſed that Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> was in my chamber, had not come thither with <hi>Iſmael,</hi> of whom he made uſe upon all occaſions, to trouble our converſation. For he feared that ſo particular an interview would diſcover the trick they had playd us; and that thinking to deſtroy our friendſhip, they ſhould ſettle it better then before. But that which they feared was far from arriving, for <hi>Mahamed</hi> and I had other manner of thoughts then to entertain our ſelves with Letters, which we had received from one another. When firſt I ſaw <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Deliment,</hi> I teſtified a great deal of unquietneſs; and addreſſing my ſelf to <hi>Mahamed</hi> with an anger, which I had not much ado to counterfeit: <hi>You perceive my Lord,</hi> ſaid I unto him, <hi>that bad examples are ſoon followed; and that the liberty which you have taken to enter into my chamber, hath drawn in a company, which I ought not to have admitted without the commandment of the Princeſs. The Princeſs,</hi> replyed <hi>Deliment, doth ſhe dispoſe of all your actions? Yes,</hi> ſaid I unto him, <hi>and ſo abſolutely, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ever diſobeying her.</hi> So that, continued he, <hi>if one were in love with you, muſt he addreſs himſelf to the Princeſs? That he muſt without doubt,</hi> anſwered I him round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>for I beleeve her to be ſo juſt, as ſhe will never force me in things, whereupon depend all the felicity, or all the infelicity of my life.</hi> We had, it may be, continued in further talk, had not one come and advertiſed them, that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was awake, and that they might ſee her. They left me then to go to her; howbeit Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſtay'd not long in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes chamber; and that he might part from thence with civility, he made as though he found himſelf not well upon going forth ſo ſoon after his ſickneſs, and retired to his lodging as ſpeedily as he could.</p>
                  <p>When he came there, he commanded <hi>Amariel</hi> to clear the room, and after he had aſſured him that they were alone, he gave him the Letter which he had taken from me, and willed him to read it. But he was ſtrangely amazed, when as he knew by the reading of this Letter, that I had been a long time engaged in affection to ſome one. For, as I have told you, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had run over welneer all that had ever paſſed betwixt us. He very well perceived by the ſtile of this Letter, that it was from a man of quality, and who feared leſt the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s love ſhould make me change; but whereas it had no name, and that the Princes blindneſs did not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60144:132"/> Permit him to know <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s hand, he could not divine who it ſhould be, and in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty he endured ſuch pain as cannot be expreſt; and ſaid things which afterwards moved me to pity when he recounted them unto me; it being moſt certain, that the privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſight was never ſo ſenſible to him as in this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Amariel,</hi> who was cunning and dextrous, judging that it much import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Sophi</hi> to ſee this Letter, and fearing the Prince would keep this paper, he folded up one, that was by chance on the Table, in the ſame form that the other was, to the end he might change it. And truly this forecaſt of his was not in vain, for indeed <hi>Mahamed,</hi> after he had cauſed this fatal Letter to be read over again, re-demanded it of him, and getting to bed with that ſame paper, which <hi>Amariel</hi> had foyſted in, by reaſon of a weakneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was taken by the exceſſive agitation of his ſpirits, he gave that Traytor the liberty to go forth. He preſently made uſe of the opportunity; and cauſing the <hi>Sophi</hi> to be advertiſed that he had ſomething to ſay to him, he had audience inſtantly. He acquainted <hi>Tachmas</hi> with <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s viſit at my lodging; his unquietneſs at his return; and at laſt ſhewed him <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, which he knew as ſoon as he had opened it; for he had ſeen many of his writing, at ſuch time as he was in War with the <hi>Azemites,</hi> and rendred him an account of his victories. He ſent immediately then for <hi>Deliment,</hi> that was newly come from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> whom he had found yet more rebellious then ſhe uſed to be. As ſoon as he appeared, <hi>I will no longer ſeek,</hi> ſaid he unto him, <hi>for that which is the cauſe of</hi> Felixana's <hi>rigor, and that which makes her despiſe my preſents, my love, and even the hope of my Crown;</hi> for it was true, that <hi>Deliment</hi> entertained me dayly with ſuch like matters. <hi>I think, my Lord,</hi> anſwered <hi>Deliment, how that which renders</hi> Felixana <hi>inflexible is, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of your greatneſs permits her not to beleeve, that you will forget it for her advantage; and the refuſals which ſhe makes, are nothing doubtleſs but that ſhe may be the more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of that which ſhe deſires it may be more then you. No ſuch matter,</hi> replyed the <hi>Sophi, and this which I have here will certainly make you change your opinion;</hi> in ſaying ſo, he ſhewed him <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, whereby they knew but too well the good-will that was betwixt us, and how much he was informed of that which the <hi>Sophi</hi> bore me. At firſt, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l <hi>Tachmas</hi> thoughts ran into violence; he would commit me to priſon; he would deſtroy <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama;</hi> and his gentleſt reſolutions were at leaſt to baniſh him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Deliment,</hi> who always joyned cunning to wickedneſs, told him, that the firſt thing he ſhould do, was, to baniſh <hi>Felixana</hi> from the heart of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> from the heart of <hi>Felixana;</hi> that to begin by the eaſieſt, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was to be dextrouſly acquainted, that I had a particular commerce with <hi>Mahamed;</hi> and that to perſwade him the better thereunto, he was to be ſhewed ſome of the letters which I had written to the Prince, and which they had retained; leting him know, in giving them to him, that they were the firſt he had received from me; that to diſquiet him further, his own Letter was to be ſhewed him, with an aſſurance that I had put it into his hands, for to give him an undoubted mark of my affection; and that at the very ſame time, wh n as this trick had excited trouble in his ſoul, he was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to get inſtantly out of the Palace, and the next day from the Court, with order to retire to the Province, whereof he was Governor; to the end he might not have leaſure to clear himſelf to me; and that beleeving he was betrayed, he might have the leſs care to let me hear from him. That things being in theſe terms, it would be the eaſier to vanquiſh me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not knowing the occaſion which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had to be incenſed againſt me, I would take it ill that he did neither write to me, nor ſee me before his departure. That the moſt important point of this affair was, to be ſo well aſſured of all thoſe which came neer me, as I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Letters from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama;</hi> and that <hi>in fine,</hi> the abſence of a Lover was a great advantage for a Rival.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sophi</hi> found this advice to be very good, and thinking on nothing but how to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, they turned their eyes upon one of <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s Officers, that had before times ſerved <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who had rid himſelf of him by reaſon of his bad inclinations. They cauſed him to be ſought out, and having immediately found and ſuborned him, he without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay (after he had been inſtructed by <hi>Deliment</hi> what to ſay, and had <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, and three of thoſe which I had written to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> put into his hands) went directly to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> whom I could not yet advertiſe of that which had paſt betwixt the Prince and me, becauſe the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s love diſquieted him ſo much, as he could not reſolve to ſee me, for fear of giving
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60144:133"/> too much notice of his thoughts; and therefore to keep him from it, he made as though he were exceedingly buſied about the affairs of <hi>Caramania,</hi> where the <hi>Sophi</hi> intended to make ſome Levies: Yet heard I for all that from him every day by that faithful Slave, which he ſent to you, and you have brought to me.</p>
                  <p>This Agent of the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s found him then in ſuch an eſtate as they deſired for the ſurprizing of him; he came to him, and finding him alone, makes him a long diſcourſe of the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he had always had to his ſervice; proteſting unto him that he would never relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it; that he acknowledged him ſtill for his Maſter, and that to render him a proof of his affection, he came, without conſidering Prince <hi>Mahamed's</hi> intereſts, to advertiſe him of a Treaſon which I committed againſt him. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> upon this occaſion had a ſecret ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of this mans malice; and imagined that he was ſent unto him to diſcover whether there were any intelligence betwixt us; ſo that nothing moved with this diſcourſe, <hi>I thank thee,</hi> ſaid he unto him, <hi>for thy zeal and affection; but know, my friend, that</hi> Felixana <hi>may well diſoblige me, but cannot betray me, having had no commerce with her, nor having ever truſted any thing to her diſcretion. I perceive very well, my Lord,</hi> anſwered this man, <hi>that you do not truſt in mine; but it may be this Letter, which I preſent you with, will better perſwade my fidelity unto you.</hi> In ſaying ſo, he gave him that which he had written to me. You may judg now whether <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> were aſtoniſhed when he came to know it; Howbeit this firſt motion being over, he imagined further, that I peradventure might have loſt it, and ſome one have found it. But the cunning of this man left him not long in this opinion; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> moved, and capable of being perſwaded, he told him, That Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> had loved me a great while, and that I alſo loved him; That ſo long as he beleeved, that there could no other harm arrive to him, then to be deceived by me, he durſt not betray <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> but having ſeen by the Letter, which he had written to me, and which, he ſaid, I had put into the Princes hands, that he ſpake in ſuch ſort, as if it came to the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s knowledg, his fortune would be utterly ruined; he was reſolved to make uſe of the Princes blindneſs to draw it with addreſs from out of his hands; <hi>and, my Lord,</hi> continued he, <hi>to ſhew you that I ſpeak truth, I have taken alſo three of the Letters which</hi> Felixana <hi>hath written to the Prince in the beginning of their affection; for as for the reſt, I durſt not meddle with them, becauſe as they are more obliging, ſo the Prince makes them to be read unto him almoſt day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by</hi> Amariel, <hi>who is the Confident of this love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> harkened to this diſcourſe, looked on her Letters and his, knew the hands, and no longer doubting of my infidelity, he thanked this wicked man, and asked him an hundred queſtions about the love that was between the Prince and me. But the other fearing that he would demand ſo many things of him, as in the end he might contradict himſelf in ſome one or other, he beſought him he would be pleaſed to let him depart, for fear leſt if any of Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s Officers ſhould ſee him go out of his lodging ſo long after he was entred in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o it, they might ſuſpect the truth. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> deceived by this artifice, diſmiſſed him, promiſed to recompence him, and prays him to continue advertiſing what ſhould paſs betwixt Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> and me.</p>
                  <p>He was hardly out of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s chamber, when, according to <hi>Deliment's</hi> advice, that old <hi>Satrap,</hi> whom as I have told you he had corrupted, came and commanded him from the <hi>Sophi</hi> to go inſtantly out of the Palace, and the next day to depart to his Government, until he received further order. And whereas <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> importuned him to tell him, why he was entreated after that manner? The <hi>Satrap</hi> anſwered him, <hi>That the</hi> Sophi <hi>onely knew it; and that he had charged him not to leave him till he was out of the Palace. Seeing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more reſting for me,</hi> anſwered <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama, but to give marks of my obedience, having given enough already of my fidelity and courage in other occaſions, let us obey without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</hi> He had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but he prepared to be gone; howbeit ſuddenly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, that he left all the Letters which I had written him in his Cabinet, he went boldly thither to take them away; and without knowing whether it were out of a ſenſe of choller or love, either to teer or preſerve them, he took a little <hi>China</hi> coffer, wherein they were, the old <hi>Satrap,</hi> who walked fairly and ſoftly before, never perceiving it.</p>
                  <p>But whil'ſt theſe things paſſed in ſuch ſort, Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who had layd himſelf on his bed by reaſon of a weakneſs wherewith he had been taken, re-aſſumed new forces, and calling for <hi>Amariel,</hi> he was told that he was gone forth, but for all that he aroſe, and cauſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60144:133"/> himſelf to be led by another to <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s lodging, whom he found alone, <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment</hi> being gone from thence a good while before, and I was not yet come unto her: For the adventure of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, which the Prince had ſnatched from me, kept me in ſo great an unquietneſs, as I knew not what reſolution to take. I feared to diſcover my ſelf to the Princeſs, doubting leſt ſhe ſhould take it ill, that I had concealed from her the affection of the Prince, and that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama.</hi> Neither durſt I acquaint <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> with that which was arrived unto me, for fear he ſhould imagine, that without this croſs adventure, I would have told him nothing of <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s love; and I judged alſo that it would not be very eaſie for me to oblige the Prince to render me <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, whenſoever I ſhould be able to ſpeak with him, which I ſaw well was at that time abſolutely impoſſible. In this irreſolution I gave the Prince leaſure to viſit the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> who, as I have told you, was alone, when as he came into her chamber. At his firſt arrival there, he commanded him that led him to get him forth, and after he had demanded of the Princeſs, whether he might ſpeak without being heard of any but her ſelf? and that ſhe had anſwered him how he might ſpeak ſafely; he requeſted her to pardon him two things, and to accord him one.</p>
                  <p>And when as the Princeſs had promiſed him that which he deſired; <hi>All the grace that I demand of you,</hi> continued he, <hi>is, That you will not think amiſs of me, when I ſhall have told you that I have a long time loved</hi> Felixana; <hi>and the ſecond, That you will pardon me, if the reſpect which I have born you hath kept me from acquainting you with it ſooner. But when as you have granted me the pardon of theſe two things, you must alſo, to keep your word with me, promiſe not to intreat</hi> Felixana <hi>the worſe for it. For though I am at this preſent not very well ſatisfied of her, and that it is rather choller then love, which carries me to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you upon this ſubject, yet I cannot reſolve for all that to hurt her.</hi> You acquaint me with ſo many ſtrange things at once, ſaid the Princeſs unto him, as I doubt whether I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them; for to tell me that you are in love with the beauty of <hi>Felixana,</hi> and that <hi>Felixana,</hi> in whom I confide in all things, ſhould make your affection a ſecret unto me, is that which I cannot comprehend, and that which I ſhall not beleeve, unleſs you give me ſtronger proofs of it. <hi>I did not ſay to you,</hi> replyed the Prince, <hi>That I am in love with the beauty of</hi> Felixana, <hi>but indeed that I love</hi> Felixana; <hi>And beleeve, dear ſiſter, that the beauty wherewith I am taken, though it wounds not the heart through the eyes, yet leaves not touching it very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; but in concluſion I am not come hither to tell you what hath made me in love, but onely that I am ſo. As for</hi> Felixana, <hi>that which hath kept her, as I conceive, from ſpeaking to you of that affection which I had for her, is, that ſhe hath none for me. And would to heaven!</hi> cryed he, <hi>That ſhe had not concealed a thing from you, which without doubt touches her more ſenſibly at the heart.</hi> Whereupon he recounted unto her the diſcourſes which he had uſed to me; the anſwers which I had made thereunto; the letters which he had written to me, the returns I had made him; and at laſt acquainted her how he had ſnatched away a letter from me, whereat I had ſhewed a great deal of unquietneſs; and that having cauſed <hi>Amariel</hi> to read it to him, he had found it to be a Love-letter, and had thereby underſtood that I had been a long time engaged in affection to him that wrote it unto me, and who queſtionleſs (as might be judged by that which he ſaid) ought to be a man of great quality; That his misfortune not permiting him to know the hand, he requeſted her to read it, that he might at leaſtwiſe be aſſured of the name of his Rival. Saying ſo, he preſented her with that foiſted paper, which <hi>Amariel</hi> had given him in ſtead of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> letter, and the Princeſs having taken and opened it, without finding any thing written therein, could not chuſe but ſigh, and lament the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of this poor Prince.</p>
                  <p>Surely, ſaid ſhe unto him, you have deceived your ſelf in taking one paper for another, for I ſee nothing in this ſame. <hi>O Siſter!</hi> ſaid the Prince, who little ſuſpected the wickedneſs that had been done him, <hi>ſpeak the truth; you know the hand of this letter, but out of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you will not tel it me, and by this adreſs you would draw it out of my hands.</hi> No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter replyed the Princeſs, and I aſſure you that I have ſpoken ſeriouſly: <hi>Why did you ſigh then,</hi> continued he, <hi>in unfolding this letter?</hi> It was, anſwered the Princeſs, becauſe I ſaw it was none; and that this adventure which would have made one that had not loved you laugh, hath made me pity your misfortune; but it may be you have this paper ſtill. <hi>No, no,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for it was made up in ſuch an extraordinary faſhion, as made me know it, and quite different from</hi> Felixana's <hi>letters which I have alſo brought you, and from which I never parted ſince I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60144:134"/> them.</hi> The Princeſs, impatient to ſee what I had written to the Prince, took one of the letters which he preſented to her, and having read it, was as much ſurpriſed as before.</p>
                  <p>I think you well remember, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that all the letters which I had written to <hi>Mahamed</hi> were in the <hi>Sophi's</hi> hands, and that thoſe which <hi>Amariel</hi> had given to the Prince had been all dictated by <hi>Deliment,</hi> and written with an unknown hand. So that whereas the Princeſs knew perfectly my hand, I cannot tell, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> whether you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that which I am going to ſay to you; but I am aſſured that <hi>Felixana</hi> never wrote the letters which you have ſhewed me. <hi>Certainly,</hi> anſwered the Prince, <hi>if I could doubt of your love, I ſhould not beleeve that which you tell me; but, my dear ſiſter, if I durſt I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to read them aloud, that I may know whither by any inchantment the ſence hath been altered as well as the hand, which</hi> Amariel <hi>hath always aſſured me was</hi> Felixana's. The Princeſs, to ſatisfie him, read two of thoſe letters, which the Prince acknowledged to be the ſame he had heard before. I ſhould beleeve, ſaid the Princeſs then to him, that <hi>Felixana</hi> knowing you could not ſee but with the eyes of another, hath counterfeited her hand, or it may be hath cauſed theſe letters to be written with an unknown one, for fear l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt ſome of them ſhould be ſeen, or loſt; but that which perſwades me there is ſomething in the matter which we cannot comprehend, is, That they are nothing like to <hi>Felixana's</hi> ſtile, which I know very well; for I ſaw almoſt every letter that ſhe ſent to <hi>Mazanderon</hi> when as ſhe wrote to her Father. <hi>I cannot for all that comprehend,</hi> replyed the Prince, <hi>what trick there ſhould be in this; for ſurely</hi> Amariel <hi>is faithful to me, and yet the letters which I have ſhewed you are not ſo obliging as</hi> Felixana's <hi>diſcourſe uſed to be, when I entertained her.</hi> At length after they had reaſoned well together about it, without being able to comprehend ought therein, and had ſent a faithful perſon to the Princes chamber to ſearch for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> letter, they reſolved to ſend for me, at that very time when as having ſtriven to baniſh ſhame and fear from my minde, I had reſolved to go and caſt my ſelf at the Princeſſes feet, and to rely more upon her affection then on mine own innocence. I arrived then at her chamber juſt as ſhe commanded one to go for me; which I had no ſooner heard, as I was coming in, but ſeeing the Prince with her, and a many of Letters on the Table, with a paper made up in the ſame manner as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s was, which the Prince had taken from me, I no longer doubted but that the Princeſs knew the truth of every thing, for I could not be ignorant that ſhe was well acquainted with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama</hi>'s hand; So that falling on my knees before her, <hi>I perceive very well, Madam,</hi> ſaid I unto her, <hi>that all my faults are known to you, and that coming with a purpoſe to accuſe my ſelf, there is nothing more left for me to do, then to beg your pardon for them, after I had tryed nevertheleſs to render them more excuſable then the incenſed ſpirit of Prince</hi> Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>would make them appear to you. Complain not of the Prince,</hi> anſwered <hi>Axiamira, ſince if he be culpable of any thing, it is of being too little ſenſible of your fault; which yet I ought not to condemn in him, ſince notwithſtanding the injury you have done me, I have indulgence enough ſtill to hear your reaſons, or rather your excuſes.</hi> After I had thanked the Princeſs for this grace, I began to recount unto her all that had paſt betwixt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama</hi> and me; for whereas I beleeved that I ſaw his Letter lie by the Princeſs, and that I was ſure ſhe knew his character, I diſguiſed nothing unto her: But for ſo much as regarded the Prince, I could not tell very well how to ſpeak of it; for not knowing what he had ſaid to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> I feared to diſpleaſe him, if I ſhould deliver things as they had paſt. Howbeit the Princeſs, having marked my unquietneſs; <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to ſpeak of the affection which my brother bears you, ſeeing I am not ignorant of any one circumſtance of it: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, to juſtifie the relation which he hath, and which you have alſo made to me of it, I will know it from your mouth too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon I recounted all that I have ſaid to you concerning it; his diſcourſes, his letters, and that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> but with ſo much ſincerity, as it ſerved not a little to perſwade the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that I had done the like for ſo much as regarded <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> as indeed I did not diſguiſe the truth unto her. <hi>But why,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>when as</hi> Ulama <hi>teſtified his love to you, and that you diſliked not the marks he gave to you thereof, did not you advertiſe me of it? And why, being engaged in affection to</hi> Ulama, <hi>did you in an ſort ſuffer that of the Prince?

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> to be his wife, but upon condition that it ſhould be agreeable to you. This is a thing which I will make apparant to you by his Letters, and which he can ſhew you by mine. For what concerns the Prince, I will acknowledg to you, that honoring him as I do, after thoſe teſtimonies of affection which he hath done me the honor to render me, and which I have not received but with reſpect, I thought I ſhould have committed a fault againſt you, and been ingrateful to him, if I ſhould have acquainted you, that this Prince, whom you eſteem of with ſo much reaſon, had had a paſſion unworthy of him. I was unwilling then that you ſhould be able to accuſe the Prince for the ſame thing, which you condemned in the <hi>Sophi,</hi> nor would I have had him loſe your love for his favor to me. And to teſtifie to you how I have thought of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, I would not even let <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> know the Princes good-will to me, for fear leſt jealouſie, which always chaſeth reaſon from them whom ſhe ſeizeth upon, ſhould carry <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> to be the leſs affectionate to the Prince, whoſe affection I have not received with ſo much corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, as that he might expect the like from me. And if you pleaſe, Madam, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Letters well, which I have written to him, you ſhall finde that I received the marks of his paſſion, as teſtimonies of his friendſhip, and not as proteſtations of his love.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs then taking one of the Letters that was on the Table, opened, and began to read it; but hearing things which I never wrote: <hi>Oh, Madam,</hi> ſaid I unto her, <hi>I have not written that which you read.</hi> You have not written it, ſaid the Prince! <hi>No, my Lord,</hi> continued I, <hi>and I am well aſſured that my memory doth not deceive me.

                  <p>Hereupon I fell a crying and lamenting: <hi>Ah! Madam,</hi> ſaid I unto her, <hi>if the</hi> Sophi <hi>knows that</hi> Ulama <hi>loves me, what uſage, do you think, will he receive for it? conſider, Madam, that he is the onely man that can oppoſe</hi> Deliment's <hi>violences; and it may be that he is the onely one that hath kept him hitherto from coming with open force, both againſt you, and againſt me.</hi> The Prince, perceiving the affliction wherein I was, and remembering how he had underſtood by my relation, that I was engaged in affection to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> before he had diſcovered his to me, ſuffered his minde to be touched with that which he bare to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> with the complaints I made, or to ſay better, with his own generoſity. <hi>Be aſſured,</hi> ſaid he unto me, <hi>amiable Felixana,</hi> reaching out his hand to that ſide where he heard me ſpeak, <hi>that if I have troubled the peace of your affection, by that which I have born to you, I will henceforward be the protector of it; and provided that you will here in the preſence of the Princeſs promiſe me your friendſhip, and will conſerve me that alſo of</hi> Ulama, <hi>I do engage my ſelf to follow your fortune, and to employ all that an unhappy Prince can do, to reſtore you to that content which I have taken from you.</hi> As we were at this point, one came and told the Princeſs, that a Slave of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s earneſtly deſired to ſpeak with her; I changed

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> hath ſent to you, preſented a Note to the Princeſs, wherein, a little after, ſhe read that which you are going to hear: For whereas it was not long, and that we have read it over often enough, it hath always continued in my memory.</p>

                  <p>The end of the reading hereof was to me the beginning of the ſharpeſt grief that ever I felt: And the alone thought of being beleeved unfaithful by a man, for whom I refuſed the Crown of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was ſo ſtrange a torment to me, as my reaſon is not ſtrong enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the reſentment which I had of it. What! Madam, ſaid I to the Princeſs, can you live in a place where ſuch wickedneſſes are committed? and againſt perſons that appertain to you? Was it not enough to baniſh <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> without perſwading him by ſome impoſture, which is unknown to me, that I had betrayed him? and it may be it is I which cauſes him to be baniſhed.

The Princeſs ſeeing a great deal of probability in that which I ſaid, could not chuſe but accompany my tears with hers; and <hi>Mahamed</hi> was ſo afflicted, as athwart my ſorrow I ſaw his reſentment.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt, for the better clearing of the matter, it was demanded of that Slave, what <hi>

Theſe Letters being written, the fear leſt they ſhould be intercepted came into my minde; ſo that to prevent it, the Princeſs ſent for an old Slave, whom ſhe had proved to be very faithful, and having given them to him, ſhe commanded him to attend that of <hi>

                  <p>As for us, ſeeing the matter in theſe terms, we reſolved that the Princeſs ſhould aſſure her ſelf of them, whom ſhe beleeved were faithful unto her, by new proteſtations of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had promiſed her.

Pardon me, my Lord, if I am carryed this way in this occaſion, ſince this raſh man by his inſolency affronts you no leſs then me; and your intereſt is no leſs conſiderable to me then mine own. Howbeit I do not deſire that you ſhould deprive your ſelf of his preſence, if it be agreeable unto you, but onely that you will forbid</hi> Deliment <hi>from ever ſeeing or ſpeaking to me more.</hi> Behold welnigh after what manner the Princeſs ſpake; who, to keep the <hi>Sophi</hi> from interrupting her, had ſo much addreſs, as not to name <hi>Deliment,</hi> but at the end of her diſcourſe, which ſtrangely ſurprized the <hi>Sophi.</hi>

                  <p>Now though he was very much in choller, and that he had reſolved to make this marriage, yet durſt he not before ſo much company tell her openly what his minde was: But to diſguiſe the matter; <hi>I ſee well enough, Axiamira,</hi> ſaid he unto her, <hi>that</hi> Deliment's <hi>greateſt crime is your beleeving him to be an enemy to</hi> Ulama; <hi>howſoever ſince you have recourſe to my juſtice, I will neither condemn nor abſolve him, till I have heard his reaſons, which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not be ſo weak as you think: In the mean time be aſſured, that</hi> Deliment <hi>ſhall not ſay any thing to you henceforward, but by order from me.</hi> The Princeſs would fain have replyed, but the <hi>Sophi</hi> made her a ſign to withdraw, which ſhe did with a great deal of reſpect; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sophi</hi> very much diſpleaſed, and all them that had heard her raviſhed with her genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and extreamly wondering at <hi>Deliment's</hi> inſolency, and the little reſentment which the <hi>Sophi</hi> had ſhewed. At our going from thence we met with <hi>Iſmael,</hi> followed by <hi>Deliment,</hi> who, knowing nothing of what the Princeſs had done, would have obliged the Prince to conduct her to her lodging: But <hi>Axiamira</hi> beholding him with contempt, ſaid unto him with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed voyce; <hi>I forbid thee from the</hi> Sophi <hi>to follow or to ſpeak to me; and if thou wilt know the cauſe of it, repair to him, and thou ſhalt learn that at laſt my patience hath given place to my generoſity; and that I am declared thy moſt mortal enemy. Deliment,</hi> ſurprized with a diſcourſe which he expected not, could ſcarce tell what to anſwer; and we left him ſo blank, as he remained a good while in the place without knowing what to do.</p>
                  <p>But at length, having left <hi>Iſmael,</hi> he went unto the <hi>Sophi,</hi> who gave him an account of <hi>Axiamira's</hi> viſit, after he had commanded all thoſe forth whom he ſuſpected. <hi>Deliment</hi> ſaw then that it was time for him to employ all his addreſs; and to that effect, he caſt himſelf at the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s feet, beſeeches him to remember, how it was by his command that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Princeſs the love which he bare her; that had it not been for him, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have dyed, then ever have made any ſhew of it; but after he had been the author of his hopes, had augmented his love, and had promiſed to render it happy, he ſhould rather take away his life, then take from him the onely thing that could make it agreeable to him, and without which he would not conſerve it.

It is true that ſhe hath loved</hi> Ulama, <hi>yet I cannot think but that the hope of a crown hath diminiſhed that affection. We have indeed ſeen the letter which he wrote to her, but we know not the anſwer to it. Beſides,</hi> Felixana <hi>ſtands upon her generoſity, and becauſe ſhe hath promiſed</hi> Ulama <hi>to be abſolutely his, ſhe is capable of reſiſting your Majeſty ſtill, though it may be ſhe would be glad in her heart that ſhe might be conſtrained to fail of her word, to the end ſhe might have a lawful excuſe. For ſo much as concerns your ſubjects, they could not accuſe you of tyranny, ſince he is no Tyrant that uſes no violence, but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one happy; that forces not the will, but for anothers good; that employs not his power, but for the felicity of him which proves it; and that in concluſion ſeeks his own contentment, without the oppreſſion of his people, and without doing wrong or ſhame to any body. For, my Lord, to ſay that</hi> Felixana <hi>is of a birth too unequal to yours, for her to wear the Crown, is to give too ſtrict bounds unto the Royal Authority.</hi> Felixana <hi>is noble to ſatisfie that unjuſt Law, which will have it ſo, but if ſhe were not, that is not to be ſtood upon, ſeeing the power of Kings never ſhews more, then when it abaſes the higheſt, and raiſes up the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed. And it is indeed in theſe encounters, that they may be named the arbitrators of the unhappineſs, or of the felicity of their ſubjects.</hi> After ſuch like diſcourſes, the <hi>Sophi</hi> ſeemed to reſolve to follow <hi>Deliment</hi>'s advice; but nevertheleſs before he would execute it, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſpeak openly to the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> touching her marriage; Whereupon if ſhe reſolved not to obey him, they would then have recourſe unto force, and conſtrain her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe would or no, to that ſhe was ſo unwilling.</p>
                  <p>I have already told you, illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> how he who waited that day at the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Cabinet door, over-heard all that I have recounted unto you; for the paſſion, wherewith <hi>Deliment</hi> was carryed away, permitted him not to have ſo much prudence as to ſpeak low; neither did the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s love and choller leave him the like providence. This man having heard a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l theſe things, felt himſelf ſo touched with the miſchiefs they were preparing for us, as he reſolved to advertiſe us of it. It is true indeed, that his generoſity was in this occaſion excited by a particular hatred which he bare <hi>Deliment,</hi> who had many times oppoſed the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his fortune. At length this man came in the Evening to advertiſe us of all theſe things; after which we alſo learned that which had paſt in the trick that <hi>Amariel</hi> had put upon us. For Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> had cauſed his ancient Governor ſo to deal, as he had layd hold on the Traytor <hi>Amariel,</hi> who out of the ſame weakneſs wherewith he had betrayed his Maſter, recounted unto us how <hi>Deliment</hi> had corrupted him; and how he had carryed all my letters to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> who had always cauſed others to be written for to be ſent to <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> from whom likewiſe they had retained all thoſe which he had made to be written to me, to give me counterfeit ones in ſtead of them. That afterwards he had carryed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Letter, which he had ſnatched from me, to the <hi>Sophi;</hi> who by <hi>Deliment</hi>'s counſel had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to fall into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s hands, with three others of thoſe which I had effectively written to the Prince. We knew then that Evening all the hurt that they had done us, and all that which they would do us; whereupon we promiſed to pardon the Traytor, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him that was faithful unto us, diſmiſſing them both, with direction to either of them to be vigilant for the good of the Princeſs. After theſe ſad news our tears redoubled far more then before. The Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But in the end the Princes ancient Governor, whom we had acquainted with the deplorable eſtate of our affairs, told the Princeſs, that in the terms wherein he ſaw things were, he did not think it fit for us directly to oppoſe the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; That love, ambition, and choller, were paſſions too violent, for one to hope to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60144:137"/> them onely by greatneſs of courage; that the greateſt wiſdom counſelled, when one cannot decline a miſchief, to endevor at leaſt-wiſe to put it off from us for ſome time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the greateſt matters, one day deferred, may cauſe revolutions which could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; that death was not a remedy but for evils, which had no other then that; that there were certain dangerous moments, which if by prudence avoyded, our enemies can no longer execute their bad deſigns; that they were to give the <hi>Sophi</hi> leaſure to reflect on that which he was going to undertake; and to that end, when as he ſhould come to ſpeak to the Princeſs, ſhe ſhould have recourſe to tears and to prayers, rather then to reaſon, which he would not underſtand: That if they ſhould not be ſtrong enough to divert him from his deſigns, as it was very likely they would not, ſhe ſhould then requeſt him to afford her ſome time to reſolve to obey him. And to the end ſhe might not by her ſadneſs give him new occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, ſhe ſhould demand permiſſion of him to abſent her ſelf from the Court for certain months, with a promiſe no longer to reſiſt his pleaſure when ſhe returned thither again; that in the mean time it might happen, that the <hi>Sophi</hi> might repent him; that the love which he bare me might be altered, or allayed by abſence; but, continued he, the principal is, That <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixana</hi> do not remain here. <hi>I know full well,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>that I will never abandon the Princeſs but to dye. And for my part,</hi> ſaid the Princeſs, <hi>I know full well that</hi> Felixana <hi>ſhall not dye without me, and that I will never abandon her to the violences of my father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In concluſion, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> without rehearſing this ſad converſation to you, it was reſolved, that if the King ſhould accord <hi>Axiamira</hi> that which ſhe was to demand of him, and yet would retain me, I ſhould then deſire him, with all the ſhew of ſorrow and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I could poſſibly expreſs, to permit me to follow the Princeſs; it being credible that the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi</hi> would not refuſe me the firſt thing I ſhould crave of him; eſpecially not mentioning at all my oppoſing of his pleaſure. It was not becauſe the Princeſſes great heart did not reſiſt the following this counſel, but becauſe ſhe being unable to finde out any other, was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it. The next day the <hi>Sophi</hi> came to the Princeſs, where after he had amplified the merit, the vertue, and the courage of <hi>Deliment,</hi> he told her that ſhe was not to take it ill, if he had had the boldneſs to ſpeak to her of love, ſeeing he had not done it but by his order; becauſe, having reſolved to marry her to him, he would have been glad that he ſhould have got her good-will. <hi>My Lord,</hi> anſwered the Princeſs, with a feigned amazement, <hi>if I had known that the boldneſs, which</hi> Deliment <hi>hath uſed in ſpeaking to me, had been an effect of his obedience to you, I had received him in another manner, I had not termed him audacious, I had been contented with complaining, and not accuſing of him, and had caſt my ſelf at your feet to cauſe you to change a deſign, whereunto I have ſuch an averſion, as I cannot think of it without grief.</hi> The <hi>Sophi</hi> ſeeing ſome change, as it ſeemed to him, of the Princeſſes minde, was extream glad of it; and though he ſaw ſhe did not render her ſelf, he beleeved nevertheleſs, ſince ſhe came to entreaties, that with ſome patience he might vanquiſh her. This hope was that which induced him the more eaſily to grant her the requeſt ſhe made him, to give her time to reſolve upon it. And truly he had been the cruelleſt of all men, if he had not let himſelf be moved with the reaſons, complaints, ſupplications, and tears of the moſt amiable Princeſs that ever was. But when he had permitted her to go to <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> which ſhe had propounded unto him for the paſſing away of the time of her exile, as in a place where ſhe had been before times for her pleaſure, he told her that ſhe was to leave me behinde with the Princeſs <hi>Perca,</hi> to the end the Court might not be deſolated, and for fear alſo leſt my father having me in his power, ſhould not reſtore me unto her when ſhe returned. I was in a corner of the chamber, where I underſtood all that they ſaid; but when I heard this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, without thinking of the reſpect which I owed the <hi>Sophi,</hi> I interrupting him, caſt my ſelf at his feet, and I ſaid ſo many things, I ſhed ſo many tears, and anſwered him ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably to certain queſtions that he asked of me, and which concerned the deſign he had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as at length I found, that the tears of a beloved perſon are very powerful arms; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sophi</hi> granted me that which I demanded of him, though it were abſolutely againſt his minde. But that <hi>Deliment</hi> might not have leaſure to get the permiſſion which had been given us to be revoked, we parted away the next morning; yet was it not without diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an expreſs to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who advertiſed him of all the ſlights that had been uſed againſt us; of the reſolution we had taken; of the place whither we were going; and of all our affairs. We left Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſo afflicted, as I never beheld the like grief. As for <hi>Perca,</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60144:137"/> ſhe ſeemed to be ſo too, but indeed ſhe was not ſorry to ſee us go; for though ſhe was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Deliment</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Axiamira,</hi> yet did ſhe not much deſire that I ſhould be the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s wife. As for <hi>Deliment,</hi> it is certain that the permiſſion which the <hi>Sophi</hi> had given us no whit pleaſed him; but to be ſecured in ſome ſort, as he is the cunningeſt man in the world, he did that which you ſhall hear, and which extreamly ſurprized us: for when we arrived at <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> we found that my father was gone from thence to the Court by the commandment of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> from whom he had received expreſs order to repair thither with all ſpeed; and that by the counſel of <hi>Deliment,</hi> who as ſoon as he knew that we were gone to <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> perſwaded the <hi>Sophi</hi> to ſend for my father, before we ſhould be arrived there; and to ordain him to come another way, for fear of meeting us; to the end, ſaid he to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> that <hi>Felixana,</hi> knowing her father in your hands, may not carry the Princeſs to diſobey you, nor her ſelf to reſiſt you, as hitherto ſhe hath done. I leave you to judg whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this adventure did not give us unquietneſs enough, eſpecially to me. What I ſaid I, muſt I betray <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> or abandon my father to the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s violence? Ah, no! I had rather dye; and not able to ſatisfie both my duty, and my love to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> I will dye that I may not be wanting either to the one or the other. But at length we underſtood by a Letter, which Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> cauſed his ſage Governor to write unto us, and by one that my Father ſent me, how the <hi>Sophi</hi> entreated him very well, and made him hope for great things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſenſe of grief then being over, we began to breathe, and take ſome reſt; But alaſs! how ſoon was this reſt thwarted? and what a ſtrange remedy did Fortune make uſe of, to deliver us both from the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s tyranny, and <hi>Deliment</hi>'s violence! The Princeſs, to be free from the importunity which ſhe received by the viſits of three or four women of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which came too often unto her, had for a good while together accuſtomed to go a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for, as I have told you, <hi>Mazanderon</hi> is on the Sea-ſhore: At the ſame time there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in that Port a Veſſel laden with the rareſt things that come to us from <hi>Europe;</hi> but alaſs! we knew not that he, who ſeemed not to come but to traffique, ſhould be our raviſher, and the cauſe of our greateſt misfortunes. <hi>Felixana</hi> making a little pauſe for to ſigh, <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> who was as well acquainted with <hi>Ruſtans</hi> artifice as ſhe; <hi>I can,</hi> ſaid he unto her, <hi>fair Felixana, ſpare you the pains of recounting unto me, how that Merchant going to the Caſtle to ſhew the Princeſs ſome Pictures, and Mirrors, ſaw you, and knew that it was not you he was to carry away by force; and having conferred the picture, which had been given him, beleeving it to be yours, becauſe he that had ſold it, had aſſured ſo much; having, I ſay, conferred it with the Princeſs</hi> Axiamira, <hi>he found that ſhe was the original of it; and how a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Felixana</hi> was going to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on in her diſcourſe, but <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſeeing it was very late, and conceiving that this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would be long, told her, that how impatient ſoever he was to hear it, yet good manners was ſtronger in him then curioſity; and that it being unjuſt to deprive the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> of a perſon, that was ſo agreeable and ſo neceſſary to her, he thought it fit ſhe ſhould repair unto her. How in the mean time, that he might not be kept too long from underſtanding the reſt of her adventures, he would ſtay and lodg all night there in the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers, to the end he might the next day alſo learn of her what was requiſite for him to know for the Princeſſes ſervice. <hi>Felixana</hi> anſwered him, that ſhe would do whatſoever he pleaſed; and ſince he had the goodneſs to permit her to go and ſee how the Princeſs did, ſhe pray'd him that it might be immediately. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> requeſted her to aſſure her of the deſire and reſolution he had to ſerve her. And as ſhe was going away, he told her further, that ſhe might take <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Slave along with her, becauſe he had ſomething to ſay to the Princeſs, who it might be would be glad to hear from his mouth the marvellous Exploits of his Maſter. <hi>Felixana</hi> thanked him alſo for this favor, and went away to <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s lodging.

Howbeit he beleeved that it was beſt in this occaſion to obey the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s pleaſure, ſeeing it would have been utterly to take away the means from him of ſerving you, if he ſhould have rendered himſelf culpable, by not ſubmitting to his commands; reſolving howſoever to kill <hi>Deliment,</hi> if the matter ſhould grow deſperate, rather then ſuffer any outrage to be done to you. In this deſign he went to his Government, where, as you know, you a little while after fully acquainted him with all the tricks that had been put upon you; and of the reſolution you had taken to go to <hi>Mazanderon.</hi> This mark of your generoſity, and <hi>Felixana</hi>'s conſtancy, gave him both at once a great deal of grief, and a great deal of ſatisfaction.

His grief was ſo great, that if I could deſcribe it unto you, I am ſure the recital of it would make you ſhed tears. At firſt he appeared more inſenſible, then afflicted; his ſilence, his paleneſs, the little motion that he had, after he had underſtood this ſad news, and his immovable look, would not permit me to be able to judg,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60144:139"/> what new misfortune it was that had arrived unto him, for this man had ſpoken very ſoftly. But I no longer doubted of it, when as ſuddenly breaking his ſilence, and ſpeaking with much precipitation; <hi>Let Fortune,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do with me as ſhe will, I am very certain that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make me more unhappy then I am.</hi> Then turning himſelf to him, who had acquainted him with your loſs, wholly tranſported with grief, and quite changed in his countenance, <hi>Let us go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>dear friend; let us go and dye in ſome remote place, ſince I am ſeparated for ever from</hi> Felixana. At this word he fell down dead in my arms, and I beleeved, ſeeing him in this pitiful eſtate, that grief had done that which his deſpair would have executed. By good hap we were not very far from a Country houſe, whither having carryed him with the help of his friend, we brought him out of his ſwoon; but it might be ſaid that it was ſome cruelty in us to bring him to his ſenſes again, becauſe withall we reſtored him to his ſorrow and deſpair. Oh, ſaid he, <hi>Felixana</hi> is in a condition, that the beſt ſhe can be for me, is not to be at all! Oh, <hi>Felixana</hi> is in the arms of death, or in the power of the <hi>Sophi!</hi> Ah! no, no, let us not be ſo baſe, as to ſupport this grief. If <hi>Felixana</hi> be dead, let us follow her generouſly; and if ſhe be anothers, let us not ſurvive our ill fortune. Then on a ſudden beginning again, after he had held his peace a little; What, ſhall the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> the glory of her ſex, and of our age, be the wife of a man, unworthy to be her Slave? and ſhall we live after we have ſo often ſworn to her to dye for her ſervice, and to defend her from the inſolency of <hi>Deliment!</hi> Ah! that may in no ſort be; and ſince I cannot ſuccor her, I know at leaſt-wiſe how to teſtifie to her by my death, that the fear of loſing my life hath not kept me from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her Enemies. Saying ſo, he walked up and down a great pace, and ſeemed to have ſome ſtrange deſign upon himſelf: But perceiving that his ſcimitar was gone, which by chance was fallen from him, we not being aware of it, as we were carrying him in a ſwoon to that houſe; <hi>Think ye,</hi> ſaid he unto us, <hi>to keep me from dying by taking my arms from me? Ah! no, no,</hi> continued he, <hi>I ſhall eaſily finde wherewithall to end my life and my miſeries.</hi> Generous <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> anſwered his friend unto him, we had no intent to take your ſcimitar from you; ſince contrarily, in the eſtate wherein I ſee things, it would methinks be fitter to ſeek for arms to revenge you, rather then to deſtroy you: For if <hi>Felixana</hi> be dead, you cannot loſe your ſelf more nobly, then in revenging her of them, which have been her Enemies du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her life: and if ſhe be not, what do you think ſhe will ſay, when as ſhe ſhall know, that the generous <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> in ſtead of ſtirring up the people, of demanding ſuccor of ſome forraign Prince, of marching in the head of an Army to aſſail her perſecutors, weakly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons her, in abandoning himſelf to his deſpair? and entreats her yet more cruelly then For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doth, ſince he will deprive her of the onely man that can deliver her, and the onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom ſhe loves. And how will you have me deliver her, if I know not in what place of the Earth ſhe is? That, my Lord, anſwered I, muſt be carefully enquired after: but if you ſhould not diſcover any thing, yet muſt you take up Arms: For if you are ignorant where <hi>Felixana</hi> is, you are not ignorant at leaſt-wiſe who are the Enemies of the Princeſs <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> and <hi>Felixana.</hi> I ſhould never have done, Madam, if I ſhould rehearſe all <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s diſcourſes unto you. Sometimes he would kill <hi>Deliment,</hi> though we made it apparant to him, that it would be almoſt an impoſſible thing; again he would preſent himſelf to the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi;</hi> then he would go unknown to <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> to enquire himſelf of your loſs: But for a concluſion of all, he ſtill returned to the reſolution of dying. At length without oppoſing our ſelves directly to his grief, we knew ſo well how to inſpire his minde with choller, as the ſole deſign of revenging you preſerved his life. He reſolved then to return to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for to think of the means he was to uſe for the ſame. As for his friend, he ſent him back again, and pray'd him ſtill to advertiſe him of whatſoever ſhould paſs at the Court; and to endevor to diſcover in what place you were retained; for he made no queſtion at all, but that you were in the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s hands.</p>
                  <p>When we were returned, he underſtood that <hi>Deliment</hi> had bethought him, to ſay no longer that you had ſuffered ſhipwrack; but contrarily he cauſed Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixana</hi>'s Father to be arreſted, upon ſuſpicion that they were intelligent with your carrying away; cauſing it to be bruited withall, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had ſome part in their crime; and that alſo preparation was a making to go and apprehend him in his Government, as rebellious and diſobedient to the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s commands. My Maſter acquainted with this news, was yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed in the opinion, that your loſs was an effect of <hi>Deliment</hi>'s artifice. This
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60144:139"/> thought made him abſolutely conclude to think of his ſafety, to the end he might be revenged. And to that effect, he retired to a good ſtrong place, which appertained to one of his friends, where he lay certain days concealed, to adviſe of what he was to do; and after he had well conſidered every thing, he judged it would be beſt for him, to put himſelf under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> whoſe reputation filled all the Orient. For knowing that <hi>Soliman</hi> had always pretentions enough upon <hi>Perſia,</hi> to have a ſpecious pretext for the recommencing of their ancient Wars, he hoped that by aſſuring him of his friends and intelligences, he might peradventure carry him thereunto; and the rather for that he knew the <hi>Georgiens</hi> had for a good while together made many incurſions into <hi>Comagena</hi> and <hi>Meſapotamia.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution taken, he diſpatched me away to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with one of the moſt obliging and generous Letters in the world; wherein he ſignified to him, that for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of what he had written, and confiding in his generoſity, he would put himſelf into <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> which is within <hi>Soliman's</hi> dominion, and not above four days journey from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s Government. As indeed, I was no ſooner departed, but my Maſter, after he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the faithfulleſt of his friends, to entertain ſome intelligence with them, in caſe he ſhould have need of it, ſet forth towards <hi>Bitiliſa;</hi> and committed himſelf into the hands of one, named <hi>Serefbeg,</hi> unto whom this Town appertained, as Vaſſal of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Empire. But though <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> told him, that he came to ſeek the protection of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and that he had to that effect diſpatched one to <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> yet this man, being of a cruel diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and provoked by an indiſcreet and bruitiſh zeal, in ſtead of barely aſſuring himſelf of his perſon, by putting a guard upon him, until he heard from <hi>Soliman,</hi> he cauſed him to be ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, to be bound, and in that deplorable eſtate ſent him to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time I had made my voyage very happily; and having delivered my Letter to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> I well perceived that he was very joyful of it; that the reputation of my Maſter was come even unto him; and that he was not ignorant of his high birth; As truly a little after, he obtained for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> all that he had demanded; And as he was preparing to ſend to receive him with honor, and was talking with him in the <hi>Hipodrome,</hi> before his Palace gate, about my return, I ſaw my Maſter arrive bound upon a horſe, his hands manacled, and his face ſo changed, as I hardly knew him: but being ſure it was he, without thinking of the reſpect I owed to the <hi>grand Viſier,</hi> I left him, and approaching to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama;</hi> My Lord, ſaid I to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſuffer not him whom you mean to protect to be ſo unworthily entreated; nor let the valiant <hi>

It is true, replyed <hi>Ibrahim</hi> embracing him, that theſe chains are not ſhameful, but for thoſe that have made you wear them; and by a fate clean contrary to that of all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers, I muſt, after the freeing you of them, crave pardon of you for the ill uſage you have received; yet ſo far happy at leaſt-wiſe herein, as you cannot ſuſpect <hi>Soliman</hi> for it, who, if I be not deceived, will make them feel the weight of your chains which have layd them on you. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> anſwered thereunto with a great deal of civility, and at length the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> cauſed him to enter into his Palace, which was hard by, charging ſome of his ſervants to ſeize upon them that accompanyed <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> the Letter he had written him, the order he had taken for his reception; and after he had told him, that he might comand in his houſe, he went to give an account of his arrival to <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was ſo incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Serefbeg,</hi> that his anger broke out terribly upon him, as you ſhall underſtand hereafter.</p>

                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came back to fetch my Maſter to the <hi>Serraglio:</hi> and as there is a ſympathy between great men, which makes them from the very firſt time of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to love one another far ſooner then others do, ſo <hi>

In ſo much as it ſeemed, that theſe two Princes had made an exchange, and given hoſtages to each other: Though it is true, that the matter was not equal for the perſons, <hi>Serefbeg</hi> having nothing recommendable in him, but a brutiſh valor, which carryed him into perils without knowing them. But at laſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> repaired to <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> whereat his firſt coming he found fit matter to exerciſe his generoſity upon; for <hi>Serefbeg</hi>'s Wife and Children came and caſt themſelves at his feet, and wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into tears, humbly beſought him to grant them the grace of her Husband and their Father. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> anſwered them, that had he been in an eſtate to receive it, he would have uſed his uttermoſt endevor to have obtained it of the <hi>Sultan:</hi> but as things were, it was a propoſition which he durſt not make. Then they requeſted him, at leaſt-wiſe not to entreat them ill. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who had no ſuch intent, aſſured them, that <hi>Bitiliſa</hi> excepted, which he was bound to conſerve for the <hi>grand Signior,</hi> he would not keep any part of their eſtate from them, though they had very great riches; and told them moreover, that if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> they ſhould be reſpected there as himſelf; or if they would go from thence, he would obtain permiſſion of <hi>Soliman</hi> to have them conducted whitherſoever they pleaſed. This afflicted and generous woman, ſeeing <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s courteſie, beſought him ſo to deal as ſhe might be ſuffered to follow the fortune of her Husband; which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> promiſed her, and performed a little after. For having obtained of the <hi>Sultan</hi> that which he had deſired of him for her and her children, he cauſed all their wealth to be loaden in Waggons; and having aſſured them of the reſtitution of <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> if peace were concluded, or if <hi>Serefbeg</hi> re-entred into favor with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> he ſent them with a convoy of four hundred <hi>Janizaries</hi> into the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Territories; for ſome Troups were already come unto him for his ſafeguard, <hi>Soliman</hi> having given command to all the <hi>Sangia</hi>'s thereabouts to march whitherſoever <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> would lead them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, whereas you and <hi>Felixana</hi> were the cauſe of all that he did, his onely care was to diſcover if any news could be had of you. He wrote alſo to Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s ancient Governor, deſiring him to entreat his Maſter, that he would, for his excuſe of what he was going to do, but remember how it was onely to revenge the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixana.</hi> But hearing nothing of you, it put him into ſuch fury, and into ſo great a deſpair, that his ordinary valor redoubled much more then before, as well appeared in the occaſions which were preſented a little after. For <hi>Ibrahim</hi> leading the vant-guard of the Imperial Army, where <hi>Soliman</hi> was in perſon, met with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> at the rendezvouz, and gave him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thirty thouſand men, to march on before for diſcovery, as knowing the Country

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> made; the taking of the City of <hi>Tauris,</hi> from whence the <hi>Sophi</hi> retreated a little before to <hi>Sultania,</hi> which as you know is but ſix days journey from it; the crowning of <hi>Soliman</hi> at <hi>Bagdet;</hi> and ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarkable things, as arrived in this War. But I will onely tell you, that in an occaſion, where <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> went to diſcover the enemy with two thouſand horſe, a party of Cavalry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the like number advanced from the adverſe Army, and charged him ſo fiercely, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſtood in need of all his addreſs and courage to ſuſtain them. He that commanded the Enemy, having ſingled himſelf out from the reſt, asked of him in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama;</hi> and my Maſter having told him how he carryed that name; thou muſt, continued he, to render the poſſeſſion of <hi>Bitiliſa</hi> lawfully thine, either take away <hi>Serefbeg</hi>'s life, or to puniſh thee for thy perfidiouſneſs I muſt triumph over thine. And then, without attending <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s anſwer, he aſſailed him with all the fury of a brutiſh reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, notwithſtanding the generoſity which my Maſter had ſhewed to his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Indeed the event of the combate juſtified that which I ſay, for after they had fought above two hours, without being ever ſundered, though they were in the midſt of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, who were fighting as well as they, in the end <hi>Serefbeg</hi> loſt his life by the valor of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama.</hi> But after this particular victory, he would alſo have a general one over thoſe who bad aſſailed him; He ſo animated his Soldiers then by his example, as ſcarce one of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies reſted alive. And to teſtifie his generoſity in all things, he cauſed the body of <hi>Serefbeg</hi> to be carryed away, for that he would not ſuffer, ſaid he, that ſo valiant a man ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in any Country, but his own: and to that effect, though <hi>Serefbeg</hi> had ſo highly off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> did what he could to encounter <hi>Deliment;</hi> but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his endevor for it, fortune would not let him fight with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In fine,</hi> Madam, Winter approaching, <hi>Soliman</hi> put part of his Troops into Garriſon, and retired to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> leaving <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> on the frontire, where he deſired to remain, not being able, as he oftentimes told me, to eloign himſelf from a Land, where he beleeved you were ſtill abiding. Not long after <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> being advertiſed that the <hi>Sophi</hi> was gone from <hi>Sultania,</hi> whither he had retred, and ſeemed to have ſome great deſign in hand, he drew moſt of the forces out of the Gariſons, and making up a body of an Army, he went with it to oppoſe the Enemy. But the <hi>Sophi,</hi> who did not deſire to fight with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> ſaw him no ſooner in the field, but he began to recoyl, contenting himſelf onely with ſeizing on the paſſages, and cutting off his victuals, carefully forbearing from deſcending into the plains, for fear he ſhould be forced to come to a battel. This artifice, which proceeded from <hi>Deliment,</hi> would for all that have availed him little, and my Maſters valor would have ſurmounted this ſtratagem, if the anger of Heaven had not been joyned to the anger of men, and fought for the <hi>Perſians.</hi> For it happened that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> having had bad intelligence, went and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that great plain, which is neer to <hi>Sultania,</hi> and as you know is invironed with four mountains, whoſe tops are always covered with ſnow, chiefly thoſe of <hi>Caspia</hi> and <hi>Nipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> beleeving then that the <hi>Sophi</hi> was retired behinde thoſe mountains, at the foot whereof are the goodlieſt plains in the world, and the moſt proper to fight a battel in, was there encamped, as I have already declared; but the <hi>Sophi</hi> had taken another way, and was retired into the Country of the <hi>Coraxens.</hi> As <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> then was in this place, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe on the top of thoſe mountains ſo terrible a tempeſt, as the winde carrying away thoſe huge heaps of ſnow, wherewith they were covered, drove them in ſuch abundance, and with ſuch raging force upon <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Camp, as all the Tents were overthrown by them; moſt of the Camels ſtifled; all the ſick Soldiers overwhelmed; ſome of the others buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live with them; and all the reſt in confuſion.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Snow had extinguiſhed all the fires in the Army, the darkneſs joyned to the roaring of the winds, to the noiſe which the Snow made in overturning the Tents, to the cries of the Souldiers in anſwer to the Commands of their Leaders, and to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of dying men, rendered this night ſo dreadful, as I do not think one can meet with an occaſionable to give more terror then that did: the conſtancy of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was not for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60144:141"/> all that ſhaken; and though his Tent was overthrown as well as the reſt, yet loſt he not his Judgment: and cauſing himſelf from the firſt beginning of the ſtorm to be heard as well as he could, he commanded every one to get out of their Tents, and afterwards to keep in their places, for fear leſt thinking to avoyd death, they might the ſooner find it in approaching to the Mountains. But at laſt upon the return of the day, the tempeſt ended, and the Sun made us ſee one of the pitifulleſt objects that ever was beheld. This deadly ſight, able to allay the courage of any but <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> augmented his; and he reſolved to be revenged of his Enemies for the loſs he had ſuſtained by the Tempeſt. Wherefore he made a ſpeedy review of his Army, and finding that he had loſt but two thouſand men that night, he concluded to ſet upon his Enemies. He ſent forth ſome then to diſcover, whil'ſt they were labouring in ſome ſort to repair the diſorder of the Tents; and having gotten an advantageous place, he ſtay'd there till he underſtood that the <hi>Sophi</hi> came on furiouſly towards him; for whereas reports increaſe at a diſtance, he had been told that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had loſt above fifteen thouſand men. My Maſter, glad of this occaſion, albeit his Army was overtoyled and weary, couragiouſly exhorted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But, Madam, without particularizing a Battel unto you, whereof the event was not proſperous to my dear Maſter, I will only tell you, that after he had almoſt vanquiſhed his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſuffering himſelf to be carried away by his extream valor, he was hemmed in by above an hundred m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n, who knowing him to be the General of their Enemies Army, aſſailed him with ſuch fury, as he was dangerouſly hurt by them in four ſeveral places; ſo as all that he could do was to rid himſelf from his Enemies, ſtill fighting till he got to his own men, where he was no ſooner arrived but he fell down dead amongſt them. This accident made the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry change party, and range her ſelf wholly on the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſide, who remained Maſters of the field: In the mean time <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s wounds proved great and dangerous; he was carried to the neareſt town, and from thence to <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> where he hath always continued, whil'ſt the <hi>Sophi</hi> making profit of his misfortune and abſence, regained all that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and he had conquered. Howbeit <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was a long time without knowing any of thoſe things: for his wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to ſo bad an eſtate, as no affair was communicated to him. And whereas I was always about him, ſo often as the violence of his ſickneſs would permit him to ſpeak, it was always of grieving to dye, before he had revenged you; but when an <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſician, which looked unto him, had aſſured us that he was out of danger, the firſt thing he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, was the defeat of his Army, the loſs of <hi>Tauris,</hi> your impriſonment, and <hi>Felix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>'s. But he underſtood this laſt by ſuch confuſed reports, as he could not comprehend by what adventure you were here. His firſt thought in this occaſion leaned to joy, and he was very glad to hear that you were living, that you were not in the power of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> and that at length he might hope to ſee you again. But this firſt motion being over, he entered into another quite contrary. What, ſaid he, do I fight againſt my lawful Prince, to endeavor the delivery of the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana,</hi> or to revenge them? and whil'ſt I hazard my life with this intention, it falls out that I ſhed my blood for the ſervice of a Prince, who keeps them priſoners; and Fortune, that is become ingenuous to perſecute me, makes me fight againſt thoſe which oppoſe him who oppreſſeth and ill-intreateth them! Pardon me, continued he, great Princeſs, the crime which I have done; pardon me, dear <hi>Felixana,</hi> the error which I have committed; and know, that though I am covered all over with wounds which I have received in ſerving thy Enemy, yet have I heart enough ſtill left me to undertake the deliverance of thee. I ſhould never have done, Madam, if I would recount unto you all that he ſaid upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt, after he had uſed his uttermoſt endeavor to be carried into a Chariot, againſt the advice of his Phyſician, he was conſtrained to ſtay two days journey from <hi>Bitiliſa;</hi> ſo that knowing it was impoſſible for him to proceed further on his way as yet, he ſent me to the <hi>grand Viſior,</hi> with direction, if he were not returned from a ſecret expedition, upon which it was ſaid he was gone, to attend for him, and to endeavor by his means to ſee you, and to give you the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Slave, who had no more but the name of it with his Maſter, having given over ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, left <hi>Axiamira</hi> very much contented, and <hi>Felixana</hi> with a great deal of ſatisfaction to know that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had ſtill conſerved his love to her. And though his wounds were the cauſe

But in regard it was indifferent late the Princeſs diſmiſſed this Slave, and reſolved, in what eſtate ſoever her health ſhould be the next morning, not to forbear ſeeing of him who was to be her Deliverer.</p>

But when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> would dextrouſly have engaged her to the recital of her adventures, ſhe deſired him he would be pleaſed, that <hi>Felixana,</hi> who had already acquainted him with part thereof, might continue the relating of the reſt unto him.

But to come to my diſcourſe, I will not ſtand then to tell you in what manner we ſuffered Shipwrack; only I will ſay to you, that when we judged by the cries of the Mariners we were in danger of periſhing, I approached to the Princeſs, whoſe great heart was not ſhaken in this occaſion, but contrarily feared the Port more then Shipwrack, and caſting my ſelf at her feet, I demanded of her with tears the grace that I might dye by her. This generous Princeſs imbraced me, and taking me by the hand ſhe never quitted it, till the Veſſel, driven by the wind and the waves with an incredible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity againſt the point of a Rock, broke all to pieces, and ſeparated us, but in what manner it was done I am not able to tell you; for I was ſo troubled, and the horrors of death ſeized on me in ſuch ſort at that dreadful inſtant, as I knew not what became of me. Yet was not the Sea altogether unpitiful unto us, for by an extream good fortune in the midſt of our ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, it carried us to the ſhoar, which was not far off; and not only preſerved our lives, but made me be found within thirty paces of the place, where the waves had caſt up the divine <hi>Axiamira</hi> in a ſwoon as well as I.</p>

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60144:142"/> gave him that of the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> for mine. Now, my Lord, the ſame error produced another; for that Merchant, paſſing afterwards to the place where Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> lived, ſold him my picture for that of <hi>Axiamira;</hi> But if the firſt fault had been the cauſe of carrying away the Princeſs by force, the ſecond accaſioned that which you are going to hear.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day wherein we ſuffered Shipwrack, Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> (who as you know remained by <hi>Solimans</hi> Order very near to the place where we were caſt on ſhoar) walking that way, came by chance where I lay extended on the ſands as a dead perſon. This accident ſurprized him; my ſex, my age, my habit, which was rich and extraordinary; and more then all that, the pity whereof this vertuous Prince was capable, cauſed him to approach unto me, and not judg me unworthy of his aſſiſtance. And then again, though the eſtate wherein I was had infinitely changed me, he conceived that I was not altogether unknown to him, and that he had ſeen ſomething that reſembled me. But he had no ſooner made the ſand, which cleaved to my face, to be taken away, but his memory brought back into his imagination my picture, which he had bought of that Merchant, and which he believed to be <hi>Axiamira's.</hi> And whereas by chance he had it about him that ſame day, he opened the caſe wherein it was, and obſerving there all the features of my face, though the ayr of it was ſomewhat changed, he no longer doubted but that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> confirming himſelf further in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by my apparel, which he ſaw to be altogether like to that which I wore in my picture. For the <hi>Sophi</hi> having found, that the habit of an <hi>Amazon,</hi> which the Painter had given us, was more advantageous then ours, would needs have the Princeſs and I wear it ever after. In this belief, Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> redoubled his care; and ſeeing me fetch a ſigh, which made him know that I was ſtill alive, he cauſed me to be carried to the next houſe to the place where I was; and commanded ſome of his people to go along by the Sea ſhoar, to ſee if they could find any other perſon that had need of ſuccour, imagining rightly, that I had not ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack alone. But ſcarcely had he given this Order, when one of his ſervants came and told him, that ſome thirty paces from thence there lay a woman attired in the ſame manner, and in the ſame eſtate that I was, who without doubt was not dead, becauſe he had diſcerned ſome motion of breathing in her.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, having left me to the care of his people, went to ſee that which this man told him of; but he did no ſooner caſt his eyes on the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> (for it was ſhe whom this man had found) but he felt himſelf preſt with an extraordinary deſire to be able to ſave her; and the compaſſion which he had on her added ſo many charms to her beauty, as he ſwore unto me afterwards he had never ſeen her more beautiful then ſhe was in that deplorable eſtate. He himſelf helped to carry her to the place where they had already layd me; and though he was perſwaded that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was one of my maids of honor, he took at the leaſt as much care of her as of me, and it might be ſaid that he did not ſerve me but out of reſpect and intereſt, and that he aſſiſted her already out of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. At length, my Lord, meeting with ſome women in the houſe whither we had been carried, they took ſuch a courſe with us, as they brought us out of our ſwoon. I was the firſt that opened my eyes, and to whom reaſon began to give a ſenſe of our miſ-fortunes, by the aſtoniſhment wherewith I was ſeized, in ſeeing my ſelf in the hands of ſo many unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But if their faces, their habits, and their language ſurprized me, their officious endeavors gave me ſome hope. This aſtoniſhment being over, my firſt thought was for <hi>Axiamira.</hi> Alas! poor Princeſs, ſaid I aloud, what is thy deſtiny! Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> hearing me ſpeak thus (for he alone underſtood the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue) believed that by thoſe few words I deplored my own miſ-fortune; ſo that quitting <hi>Axiamira,</hi> to render me that which he thought he owed to my condition, he came to comfort me, and aſſured me that I was in a place where the ſame ſervices and honors ſhould be done me, as if I were in the Court of the <hi>Sophi</hi> my father. I was equally ſurprized, both with hearing <hi>Gianger</hi> ſpeak to me in the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue, and with his taking me for <hi>Axiamira.</hi> Howbeit finding my ſelf in the hands of people that were unknown to me, I reſolved not to diſabuſe them; hoping that this opinion would make me be with the more ſafety amongſt them, and would poſſeſs them with the more reſpect: But I would not avouch ſo much preciſely, ſo that I contented my ſelf with telling him, that in the eſtate wherein I was, the beſt that could arrive unto me was to dye; nevertheleſs that I would not refuſe his aſſiſtance and protection, ſeeing he had the generoſity to offer it me. Theſe few words had like to have made me fall again into a ſwoon, juſt as the Princeſs began
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60144:142"/> to come out of hers, and that opening her eyes, as I underſtood afterwards, ſhe left them no longer in doubt but that ſhe alſo might be ſuccoured. But whether it were that ſhe was of a weaker temper then I, or whether the Sea had toſſed her more, ſhe was above four hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could ſpeak; and that was it which kept me from perceiving that we were bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It was then, my Lord, that I was greatly amazed; for theſe people having ſet me in the Charet, the Prince came and asked of me, whether I would be pleaſed, that a maid, whom he believed did belong unto me, becauſe ſhe had been found on the Sea ſhoar in the ſame caſe he had taken me up, ſhould come into the Charet to me? I deſired him with much impatience to let her be brought, imagining that it might be <hi>Axiamira.</hi> As indeed, he had no ſooner commanded it, but I ſaw two men bring her to me in a Chair. And truly in this encounter it fell out well for the deſign we had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that <hi>Gianger</hi> was a pretty way from us, and that there was no body near us which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood my language; for as ſoon as I ſaw her, I could not forbear crying out; <hi>Ah! excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princeſs, live you ſtill? and hath fortune been ſo pitiful, as not to ſeparate your deſtiny from mine?</hi> My voyce revived <hi>Axiamira</hi> more then all the remedies they had uſed to her till then; and as ſoon as ſhe was in the Charet where I was, ſhe embraced me with ſo much joy, as ſhe thereby recovered the uſe of her ſpeech, to teſtifie unto me the comfort ſhe received in ſeeing her ſelf with me. But, continued ſhe, my dear <hi>Felixana,</hi> in what Country are we? who are theſe that aſſiſt us? and what intereſt have they in our conſervation? do they not pretend to force us to live, to conſtrain us afterwards to have recourſe unto death, by returning us into the hands of <hi>Ruſtan?</hi> For, ſaid ſhe, I ſee them have Turbants, whoſe colour makes me know them to be <hi>Solimans</hi> Subjects. Madam, ſaid I, I cannot anſwer to ſo many things, though I have for above two hours obſerved with a judgment ſound enough all that hath been done here. But this I can tell you, that he, who ſeems to be the Maſter of all them I have ſeen, is exceeding civil, and ſhould be a man of great quality, ſo far as I can gueſs by the high reſpect which the reſt do give him. But that which troubles me is, his taking me for you, and his aſſuring me in our language, that I ſhall have the ſame honor done me here, as in the Court of the <hi>Sophi</hi> my father. It may be, ſaid the Princeſs, I can remember ſome words of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> tongue, which I learned of an old Slave when I was a child; and then making a ſign to one of thoſe which accompanied us, that ſhe would ſay ſomething to him, when as he came near her, and that ſhe had ſtudied a while, ſhe demanded of him with much ado, and in a language that was not very intelligible, the name of him that commanded them. This man apprehended not at firſt what ſhe would ſay to him, but at length joyning ſigns to her ſpeech, ſhe made her ſelf be underſtood. He anſwered her then in his language, that it was the Prince <hi>Gianger.</hi> This name of <hi>Gianger</hi> touched the Princeſs ſenſibly, and making a ſign to this man, that ſhe had no more to ſay to him; I knew full well, ſaid ſhe to me, that Fortune did not ſave me, but to undo me; and that ſhe kept me not from periſhing, but to expoſe me to new miſeries; for, ſaid ſhe, he in whoſe power we are is the ſon of <hi>Soliman.</hi> It is not becauſe Fame doth not ſpeak advantageouſly of him; but ſtill, he is the ſon of a man, which hath cauſed me to be forcibly carried away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Axiamira's</hi> diſcourſe ſeemed ſo full of reaſon to me, as I could not make any Reply to it; but in the end carried by the paſſion which I had to ſerve her, I told her, that to avoyd the miſchief ſhe feared, Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> was not to be diſabuſed of the opinion he was in, that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia;</hi> that in the mean time we ſhould labour to know, wherefore he took me for that which I was not; and that in trying to diſcover his deſigns, we ſhould frame ours according to that we ſhould learn of him. The Princeſs was ſo afflicted, as without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining whether that which I told her was reaſonable or no, ſhe conſented unto it at the ſame inſtant, when as the Prince, who out of reſpect had always marched before, came cloſe to the Charet. This while we arrived at <hi>Giangers</hi> Palace, who led me to a ſtately lodging, and who would alſo have given another to <hi>Axiamira;</hi> becauſe, ſaid he, ſhe was not in caſe to ſerve me: But having requeſted him to leave her with me, he quitted us, and went out of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60144:143"/> chamber, as ſoon as that old Jewiſh Phyſician came in; who, after he had miniſtred unto us that which he thought was neceſſary for our recovery, left us at liberty to talk of the eſtate of our fortune.</p>
                  <p>I will not declare unto you, my Lord, the cares, the civilities, and the duties, which <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anger</hi> rendred me from that very firſt evening in the quality of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> ſince it would be to ſpend time unprofitably. But you ſhall underſtand, that coming to ſee me the next day, I demanded two things of him; the one was, to tell me how he knew that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia?</hi> and the other, not to publiſh that I was in his hands, till I had time and ſtrength to entertain him with my misfortunes. To the firſt he anſwered me, in letting me ſee the Caſe wherein my picture was, which as ſoon as I had beheld I knew it ſtraight. But, my Lord, ſaid I unto him, who told you that this was <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s picture? The M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rchant, ſaid he, that ſold it to me; and who long before had alſo ſold another to the Emperor my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he ſaid was a maids, named <hi>Felixana,</hi> whom the <hi>Sophi</hi> very much eſteemed; whom you exceedingly loved; and who without doubt ought to have very much merit and beauty, ſince, as this Merchant told me, ſhe was crowned as well as you, as the faireſt of all <hi>Perſia.</hi> This <hi>Felixana,</hi> anſwered I coldly, had queſtionleſs a beauty extraordinary enough to oblige <hi>Soliman</hi> to buy her picture. Now, my Lord, it is certain that this diſcourſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me; for then I knew, that the Merchant, to whom our pictures had been given, was deceived, and had not underſtood the <hi>Sophi</hi> well; the likeneſs of clothes having no doubt contributed much to the making of this error. So it was, that I plainly perceived how <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had effectively loved <hi>Axiamira</hi> by means of her picture, but under the name of <hi>Felixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which had occaſioned her forcible carrying away; and how the ſaw error, and the ſame change of pictures, was the cauſe that Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> took me for her, as the Emperor had before taken her for me.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond thing, which I had demanded of the Prince, he eaſily granted it me; for whereas he was become deſperately in love with the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> his deſire was not to be obliged to carry us ſo ſoon to <hi>Soliman,</hi> as maxims of <hi>State</hi> required: It being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that the daughter of a great King ſhould be in his hands, and he not remit her into the Emperor his fathers, as ſoon as it was known. So to content me, and to ſatisfie himſelf, he forbid thoſe, which had had any notice of the quality he gave me, to be known of it: And ſtill, to gain time, I made my indiſpoſition laſt as long as poſſibly I could. In the mean ſpace the Prince, who at firſt ſight had been mightily taken with the beauty of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> could not forbear giving her ſome marks of it, but with ſo much reſpect, as if ſhe had appeared to be that which truly ſhe was, ſhe could not have been offended at it. This generous Prince told us ſince, that he tryed to withſtand this ſpringing paſſion as much as he was able; and that againſt the cuſtom of his Nation, which conſiders not the nobility of blood, he was ſo troubled to think that ſhe whom he loved was not of Royal birth, as he could not be quiet in his minde. He had yet ſome intervals, wherein his imagination ſhewed him the truth, and wherein it perſwaded him that <hi>Axiamira,</hi> whom I called <hi>Iſmaida</hi> as long as our plot laſted, was ſomething more then ſhe ſeemed to be; and in this thought he engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo deeply in loving her, as he could not forbear giving her teſtimonies thereof in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, though he rendred me nevertheleſs all the reſpect, which was due to a Princeſs, of whom I borrowed the name.</p>
                  <p>We lived ſome time in this ſort, with content enough, that is to ſay, as long as the Princes viſits kept us from thinking ſeriouſly of our misfortunes. For when we were alone, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what was paſt, and the fear of that which was to come, gave us but little reſt. The preſence of the Prince was oftentimes alſo ſomewhat grievous to me, eſpecially at ſuch time as he preſſed me by his entreaties to tell him by what adventure I had ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack upon that Coaſt; having much ado to finde excuſes to diſpenſe me from it, being not yet well reſolved on that which we were to tell him. This Princes love likewiſe began to poſſeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> with unquietneſs, out of the fear ſhe had, leſt the ignorance of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhould carry him to ſome deſign, which might be diſadvantageous to her. But for me, who ſaw ſo much vertue and wiſdom in this Prince, I feared nothing from him; and I made it appear to my Lady, that this love, which gave her ſo much apprehenſion, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give her ſome aſſurance; ſince being retained by the reſpect, which he thought he owed to me, and by the love which he bare her, he would never enterprize any thing, which might
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60144:143"/> anger her, or diſpleaſe me. In the mean time, my health being recovered, ſooner then I would have had it, and <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s in too good an eſtate to be diſpenſed withall from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> fearing leſt notwithſtanding his providence the Emperor ſhould come to know that the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was in his hands, propounded unto me, with the moſt addreſs and civility that poſſibly he could, the conducting of me to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> to the end, ſaid he unto me, that the Emperor rendering unto you the honors, which are due to a perſon of your birth, may ſend you back to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> with an equipage proportionable to his greatneſs, and your condition. My Lord, ſaid I unto him exceedingly ſurprized, and without conſulting <hi>Axiamira,</hi> ſo do, as owing you our lives, we may alſo owe our liberty to you; and without conducting us to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> permit us to return unknown into <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gianger</hi> had no minde to grant me this requeſt; for beſides that reaſon of <hi>State,</hi> and his own conſervation, would not ſuffer him to do ſo; his love would not conſent that he ſhould for ever loſe the preſence of one, who was ſo dear to him as <hi>Axiamira</hi> was. And the thought which he had had, to conduct me to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſeemed ſo much the juſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, becauſe he ſhould thereby retain in his Country the perſon whom he loved. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how he looked upon the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> when I made this motion unto him, and that changing colour he ſighed twice or thrice. But at length after he had endevored to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me, he gave me ſuch preſſing reaſons to let me know the injuſtice of my requeſt, as not able to deſtroy them, I at leaſt-wiſe deſired ſome time of him to reſolve my ſelf for it, which he granted me very kindly. We were no ſooner at liberty, but the Princeſs beholding me with tears in her eyes, What ſay you now, <hi>Felixana,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me, do you know any other way but death to avoyd the miſeries that are prepared for us? and whoſe rigor is ſo great, that I have not ſo much as the ſatisfaction to finde any whom I can accuſe for it, ſeeing <hi>Gianger</hi> doth nothing but what he ought to do. Madam, ſaid I unto her, we muſt make uſe in this occaſion of the Princes error; and with the precious ſtones that are on your clothes ſuborn ſome one of the Guards that are about us, to let you eſcape and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you away, either here, or during the voyage we are going to make, where you will not be ſo obſerved as I ſhall be.

And then, do you beleeve that <hi>Axiamira,</hi> could ſhe finde ſafety by her flight, would abandon you, and leave you in the power of a Prince, who, tranſported by the affection that he bears me, would ill entreat you afterwards.

And then, Madam, if the vertue of this Prince, and his love, ſhall refuſe us our liberty, I will be the firſt to ſhew you the way to death by my example, finding as well as you, that it is ſweet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60144:144"/>
                  <p>But how do you think, ſaid the Princeſs unto me, to perſwade <hi>Gianger,</hi> that you are not <hi>Axiamira;</hi> that I am verily the daughter of the <hi>Sophi;</hi> and that it was <hi>Soliman</hi>'s deſign to have me forcibly carryed away? Truth, anſwered I, hath lights which makes her to be eaſily known; and the freeneſs and ingenuity, wherewith I mean to ſpeak to <hi>Gianger,</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, if I deceive not my ſelf, that I am no other then <hi>Felixana,</hi> and that you are <hi>Axiamira.</hi> For the next, it is not poſſible but that this Prince ſhould know <hi>Ruſtan;</hi> and when we ſhal mark him out the time that he came to <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> he wil remember whether he were at the Port then or no; or if he be ignorant thereof, he may dextrouſly enquire in what place he was at that ſame time: Moreover, if he periſhed when we ſuffered ſhipwrack, his death will juſtifie my diſcourſe; and if he eſcaped, it is impoſſible but that the bruit of this accident ſhould be ſpread abroad amongſt ſome; and that at leaſt it ſhould be heard ſpoken, how he thought he ſhould have been drowned, though it be not known upon what occaſion, or in what voyage. But, Madam, without ſearching for ſo many proofs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that which I purpoſe to ſay, I am confident, how I ſhall no ſooner tell <hi>Gianger</hi> that you are the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but he will finde in your eyes the juſtification of my diſcourſe; he will wonder that he did not know you; and repenting him of his error, he will crave pardon of you for it. For, Madam, there is ſomething ſo majeſtical in your face, as I doubt not but you have had more ado to conceal your ſelf, then you will have to make your ſelf be known. And then again, the greateſt misfortune that can arrive to us by it, is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, and that being ſo, we are in the ſame eſtate, as now we are: and in the ſame liberty to have recourſe unto death.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs, perceiving ſome reaſon in that which I ſaid, permitted me to ſpeak to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anger,</hi> provided that ſhe might be in her Cabinet during our converſation. I ſent then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to deſire the Prince that I might ſpeak with him, whereupon he came forthwith to my chamber; and when as he would have uſed the ſame reſpects to me, as he had accuſtomed; It is no longer time, ſaid I unto him, my Lord, to abuſe your goodneſs; It was requiſite at firſt, when as yet we knew you not, that we ſhould be unknown to you, for reaſons that you ſhall hear; but now that we know your wiſdom, your vertue, and your generoſity, it is juſt that you alſo ſhould know us; and that the freedom which we uſe in acquainting you with out misfortunes, and in confiding abſolutely in you, ſhould obtain us that pardon which we crave for having deceived you. The Prince remained very much ſurprized with my diſcourſe, and whereas I perceived it; I ſee, my Lord, ſaid I unto him, the impatience you are in, to underſtand that which I am to ſay to you, doth diſquiet you; and therefore, to ſatisfie you in few words, know, that I am not <hi>Axiamira.</hi> You are not <hi>Axiamira,</hi> ſaid the Prince unto me exceedingly amazed! O, Madam, labor not to perſwade me the contrary, ſince it would be in vain. No, my Lord, continued I, I am not the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and you ſee before your eyes onely that <hi>Felixana,</hi> of whom you have heard ſpeak too advantageouſly: yet think not that I will take the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> out of your power; ſhe is in it, my Lord, and ſhe is in it in an eſtate, that hath need of your protection: It is you alone on whom her good or bad fortune doth depend; or to ſay better, it is you on whom her life or death doth depend. And to draw you quite out of the pain wherein I ſee you, know, my Lord, that the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable perſon, whom you have ſo eſteemed of under the name of <hi>Iſmaida,</hi> is truly <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and the moſt excellent Princeſs that is in the world. This laſt amazement of the Prince was as great as the other; but with this difference, that amidſt the trouble of his ſoul I ſaw ſome joy in his look. He beleeved me not for all that at firſt, but I perceived that it was a matter, whereof he would have gladly been perſwaded. Is it poſſible, ſaid he unto me, that you ſhould ſpeak the truth? and will you not take it ill if I ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you? or if not being able to rely on your words, I requeſt you to tell me ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that may clear me in a thing that is ſo doubtful.</p>
                  <p>It is juſt, ſaid I unto him, that you ſhould not beleeve me upon the bare report of my words, but that your reaſon ſhould perſwade you. And then I recounted unto him, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ruſtans</hi> arrival at <hi>Mazanderon;</hi> the ſleights which he had uſed to get a ſight of me; the forcible carrying of us away; the diſcourſe that he had made to <hi>Axiamira;</hi> how he had given her to underſtand that <hi>Soliman</hi> was fallen in love with her picture, which he had in his keeping; and how for that cauſe he had brought her away by force; but alſo to teſtifie the more confidence unto him, I told him in part, upon what occaſion we were at <hi>Mazan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deron,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60144:144"/> the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s rigor, and the Princeſſes avertion to <hi>Deliment.</hi> I made this relation with ſo much ſincerity, as <hi>Gianger</hi> found himſelf capable of diſcerning it; and that which yet helped me to perſwade him that I did not lye, was that he remembred, how he had heard that <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who was his enemy, as well as his brother <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s, was gone from the Port upon a ſecret expedition; and had embarqued himſelf at <hi>Pera</hi> in a veſſel laden with merchandize. This conſideration having removed all ſcruples from his minde, I ſaw a great d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But why (ſaid he unto me after ſome ſilence) do not I ſee this Princeſs, of whom I am to crave pardon for my error? Is it to puniſh me for the fault, which I have ignorantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that ſhe will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>prive me of her ſight? My Lord, ſaid I unto him, this great Princeſs, to leave you the liberty to doubt of my words, is retired into her Cabinet, whither if you pleaſe we will go unto her. Saying ſo, ſhe opened the Cabinet door, and <hi>Axiamira</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng towards them in ſome confuſion, the Prince went and caſt himſelf at her feet. Ah! Madam, ſaid he unto her, how faulty ſoever I appear in your eyes, my heart is innocent; it being moſt certain, that it hath advertiſed me more then once what you were: I have had reſpects and thoughts of veneration for you, which I durſt not make ſhew of, in the error wherein I was, both by that of the Merchant, and your diſcourſe. My Lord, ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs lifting him up, your error is ſo much the more pardonable, becauſe in taking <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lixana</hi> for me, you were not much deceived, ſeeing it is certain, that ſhe is another my ſelf. But, my Lord, continued ſhe, let not the confidence which we have in your vertue be in vain. Nor let not, Madam, replyed he, the remembrance of that which is paſt be diſadvantageous to me; and for my part, beleeve abſolutely, that there is nothing which I will not perform to do you ſervice. For, Madam, ſince my good fortune would have you unknown to me, that I might take upon me the boldneſs to teſtifie ſome part of the paſſion I am in for you, which peradventure I durſt not have done otherwiſe, although it be moſt pure, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; be aſſured, that now, when as I know how this paſſion is worthy of the ſon of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> nothing can ſeparate me from your intereſts. Command then abſolutely, and be moſt confident that you ſhall be obeyed. I had not much ado to be perſwaded, continued he, that a perſon, whom I judged worthy to be Queen of all the world, ſhould be the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia;</hi> but I marvel much at my blindneſs, that I could not diſcern you were that indeed, which I have ſo often wiſhed you were.</p>
                  <p>Since your generoſity permits me to ſpeak, ſaid the Princeſs interrupting him, Let not the wicked deſigns of <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> my Lord, be executed by Prince <hi>Gianger;</hi> let me not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by your hand to the <hi>Serraglio;</hi> nor let the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> have the deſtiny of Slaves. For, my Lord, not to conceal my thoughts from you, I will dye a thouſand times over, rather then do any thing unworthy of that which I am. You know, my Lord, that <hi>Soliman</hi> having marryed <hi>Roxelana,</hi> cannot according to his Law have any other lawful wife; ſo that if you put me into his hands, and that I am not generous enough to have recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, this Princeſs, who all her life-time hath had no other paſſion but that of glory and honor, would be the moſt infamous of her condition. Judg now, my Lord, whether my prayers be not juſt, and if I have not reaſon to employ my tears, to obtain that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of you?</p>
                  <p>The Prince heard <hi>Axiamira</hi> with great agitations of ſpirit: He was raviſhed to ſee that his paſſion had ſo noble and ſo great an object; but the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s love gave him no little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs; and not knowing what to do, he continued a while without ſpeaking; but at length he ſaid thus; Do not think, Madam, that my ſilence is an effect of my irreſolution, I have not been conſidering whether I ought to ſerve you, but of the means I am to uſe for it. Fear not then that I will carry you to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and beleeve that therein I ſhall ſerve my ſelf no leſs then I ſhall ſerve you. But, Madam, when I ſhall be reſolved exactly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your pleaſure, will it be juſt, that for ſaving you from peril, I ſhould remain the moſt unhappy of men? That for delivering you from the violence of <hi>Soliman,</hi> you ſhould aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me to the violence of my deſpair, by ordaining me to let you return into <hi>Perſia?</hi> For, Madam, henceforward my deſtiny is inſeparable from yours; and I ſee no mean betwixt dying and abandoning you.</p>
                  <p>The Prince made this diſcourſe with ſo many teſtimonies of affection, as the Princeſs was
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60144:145"/> in ſome ſort moved therewith. My Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, I ſhould eſteem my ſelf very infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, if my encounter ſhould prove fatal to you, and that by a deſtiny wholly particular to me, my misfortune ſhould be ſo great, as to be communicated to the perſons that aſſiſt me. But I will beleeve, that the matter ſhall not go in that manner, and I wiſh with all my heart, that you may have as much proſperity, as I have miſery. And that you may know I deſire your felicity, conſider to what rigors of Fortune I am expoſed. I requeſt you that you will not conduct me to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to avoyd the violence of <hi>Soliman;</hi> and I requeſt you alſo that you will not conduct me into <hi>Perſia,</hi> to avoyd the violence of a father, and the inſolence of a brutiſh man, who will both uſurp the Empire, and force me to be his wife. But, my Lord, as I requeſt theſe two things of you, ſo I requeſt yet one more, and that out of a ſence of glory and honor, which are the two moſt powerful inclinations of my Soul; and it is, my Lord, that I may remain no longer in your hands: For albeit I fear nothing from ſo vertuous a Prince, yet ſhall I be very glad, that Envy may not find any thing to charge my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with. So do then, my Lord, that I may not go to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> that I may not return into <hi>Perſia;</hi> that I may not continue in your hands; that I may find a ſanctuary where Civility permits me to abide; or that I may dye at your feet. <hi>Gianger</hi> was ſo raviſhed with the vertue and wiſdom of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> as turning himſelf to me, It muſt be acknowledged, ſaid he to me, that the Princeſs is incomparable; that I have been blind indeed not to know her, and to reſiſt the ſecret motions which advertiſed me of my duty. After this he ſtood a pretty while without ſpeaking, then ſuddenly beginning again. If I had not, Madam, ſaid he unto her, found out the means to place you in ſafety, and to content my ſelf alſo, I ſhould dye with grief; but if I be able to offer you the company of a Princeſs, whoſe vertue is without ſtain, whom you may abſolutely command, and who is wife to Prince <hi>Muſtapha</hi> my Brother, I think you will have cauſe to be ſatisfied. <hi>Axiamira</hi> was exceeding glad of this propoſition, having oftentimes before heard ſpeak of the vertue of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s wife, who ſhe had been told was deſcended of the ancient Kings of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> So that addreſſing her ſelf to the Prince with a great deal of ſatisfaction, may I hope, my Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, that Prince <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and his excellent wife, will permit me to live unknown in their Palace, until that Fortune, weary of perſecuting me, ſhall no longer keep me from returning into my Country? Your vertue alone will oblige theirs to ſuccor you, but if that were not, the ſtrict friendſhip which is betwixt us will oblige them ſufficiently unto it. All <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s intereſts are mine, even as my Fortune is his. And truly we are far from thoſe apprehenſions of State, which for ſo long a time have made the children of the <hi>Othoman</hi> family to tear one another in pieces like enraged Tygers; and I am well aſſured that if <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> my eldeſt Brother, comes once to the Empire, he will let me enjoy the felicity of his Raign, and will not ſend me either mutes or ſlaves to ſtrangle me. I tell you all theſe things, Madam, to the end you may not doubt but that the ſanctuary which I have propounded unto you, will be inviolable. Moreover, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Muſtapha</hi> is Governor of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and that City is the Capital of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which we call <hi>Amaſia,</hi> you may well conceive that you will be far enough from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and not ſo far from <hi>Perſia,</hi> but that you may eaſily hear from thoſe which are affected to you there.</p>
                  <p>All theſe particulars having ſeemed very reaſonable unto me, I the more confirmed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the deſign ſhe had to accept of them, both for her intereſt and mine own; it being moſt certain, that I no leſs feared the <hi>Sophi's</hi> love, then ſhe did <hi>Deliments.</hi> This reſolution taken, nothing was thought on but executing it: <hi>Gianger</hi> diſpatched a man, who was faithful to him, to let <hi>Muſtapha</hi> underſtand that which he deſired of him; but with ſuch preſſing terms, as it had been impoſſible for his brother to have refuſed him. And giving order for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Princeſs, whom before folks he intreated as he was wont to do, we ſet forth two days after for <hi>Amaſia,</hi> with as little company as might be, and in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> habits, to be the leſs noted. I will not tell you, my Lord, with what generoſity Prince <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and <hi>Saraida</hi> his wife, received <hi>Axiamira;</hi> let it ſuffice me to ſay, that <hi>Gianger,</hi> having left us ſome two miles ſhort of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> under the charge of an old Governor of his, in whom he very much confided, and having acquainted his brother and ſiſter in law with our Fortunes, they rendred in particular to <hi>Axiamira</hi> all the honors which ſhe could have received in her own Country. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after all that we had delivered was plainly juſtified. For <hi>Muſtapha</hi> underſtood the return of <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and his diſgrace; and preſently thereupon he was told, that the Princeſs and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60144:145"/> I were not at the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Court; that the report went we were drowned; and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believed how <hi>Tachmas</hi> and <hi>Deliment</hi> had cauſed us to be forcibly carried away. After this we lived happily enough; <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s care, <hi>Saraides</hi> compliance, and <hi>Gianger</hi>'s reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affection, rendred our Exile ſupportable enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Axiamira</hi> could not for all that be at reſt; ſhe wrote many times to divers perſons, which were affected to her in <hi>Perſia,</hi> without ever receiving any anſwer. And whereas ſhe ſaw no end of her miſeries, ſhe could not be without unquietneſs; which at length brought her to a ſickneſs, which it was thought would prove mortal to her. Her Fever was not very violent, but it was without intermiſſion; and though ſhe felt no great pain, yet was ſhe ſo weak, and ſo low brought, as we durſt not hope ſhe could ſurmount the diſeaſe wherewith ſhe was taken: during the which <hi>Saraida</hi> and I never abandoned her; and the two Princes ſaw her as often, as the neceſſity of their affairs, and civility would permit them. Now though <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> had nothing but friendſhip for <hi>Axiamira,</hi> yet ſeemed he to be as much afflicted as <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anger;</hi> ſuch a ſympathy was there in all things between theſe two excellent Princes. We continued three Months in this ſort, without knowing what we were to expect concerning the Princeſſes life: for albeit at length the Fever left her ſometimes, yet was it for ſo little while, as it did not permit us to hope the recovery of her health. But whil'ſt I was ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dding tears for her, the Princes and <hi>Saraida</hi> took great care to conceal from the Princeſs, and me too, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had made War in <hi>Perſia;</hi> which was the cauſe I knew not that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had betaken himſelf to his party. And that which kept <hi>Muſtapha</hi> from ſaying any thing to us of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, was not only the fear of afflicting <hi>Axiamira,</hi> but the doubt <hi>Gianger</hi> was in, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhe came once to know it, ſhe would be averted from a Prince, whoſe father went about to deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her Country. We lived then above two Months in this ignorance after the Princeſs was out of danger: for whereas we ſaw no body but <hi>Mustapha, Saraida,</hi> and <hi>Gianger</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our language, it was eaſie for them to keep us from knowing any thing but what they pleaſed. But one day as the Princeſs and I were alone, ſpeaking of the affection that <hi>Gianger</hi> hore her, and amplifying his vertues, which I oppoſed to the vices of <hi>Deliment,</hi> I in ſome ſort preſſed her to acquaint me with the thoughts which ſhe had for him. Why I will tell you now, <hi>Felixana,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me, I eſteem of <hi>Gianger</hi> as much as his vertue doth merit; I do acknowledg his good Offices as much as one can; and I bear as much good-will to him in my heart, as I do to Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> my brother: but for that paſſion, which diſorders the mind, which deſtroys Reaſon, and which troubles the reſt of them whom it poſſeſſeth, I am not capable of it; and I could wiſh that <hi>Gianger</hi> carried a more quiet affection to me. That weakneſs is a blemiſh, which I do not deſire ſhould be in great Souls: nor is it any thing but the ſubtilty of men which hath perſwaded us, that this paſſion is not vicious, ſince all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, and that every one believes them to be ſo, though they do not produce ſuch deadly effects. And to know how much more dangerous it is then the reſt, we are but to conſider how it commonly ſtirs up all of them; Hatred, Anger, Envy, and Ambition it ſelf, are many times the followers of it; yet do not think, that I will be ingrateful to Prince <hi>Gianger;</hi> for know, how averſe ſoever I am from marriage, I would notwithſtanding reſolve to be his wife, rather then render him unhappy, if the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Soliman</hi> could conſent thereunto. For, continued ſhe, I may indeed oppoſe the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s pleaſure, but I can never be drawn to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my ſelf without his order. As I was going to take <hi>Gianger</hi>'s part, he entered into the Princeſſes chamber, and approaching to her with all the obſervance which he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to yield her, he began to talk to her of his affection; and he repreſented unto her the reſpect wherewith he had ſerved her, the greatneſs of his love, the little teſtimony ſhe had given him of accepting it, the deplorable eſtate of his Fortune, the ſmall likelihood there was, that after ſo many Letters vainly written into <hi>Perſia,</hi> that the friends which ſhe had left, were ſtill generous enough to ſerve her. That he knew how the <hi>Sophi</hi> was more affected to <hi>Deliment</hi> then ever, and that he alone governed the Empire: So that ſhe could never hope, either to alter <hi>Deliment,</hi> or to make the <hi>Sophi</hi> change his reſolution, but by the neceſſity of reſolving on that which they could no longer avoyd.</p>
                  <p>I perceive well, my Lord, anſwered ſhe ſighing, that my misfortune is ſo ſtrange, as the moſt ingenuous ſpirit could not foreſee any other end of it, then ſuch as muſt be fatal to me; for if I have Enemies in <hi>Perſia,</hi> I have others alſo at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But to anſwer the complaints which you make againſt me, I will open my heart unto you, and if after that you be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60144:146"/> I profeſs that Fortune hath not yet made me feel her cruelleſt rigors. Ah, Madam, ſaid the Prince interrupting her, ſuffer me firſt to tell you, that if you deprive me of the hope which my extream love hath made me conceive, nothing will be able to preſerve my life. My Lord, replyed <hi>Axiamira,</hi> have patience, and do not condemn me without hearing me. And to begin with the Obligations wherein I am engaged to you; I know that I owe you my life; that the reſpect which you have ſhewed to me, in a time when you knew me not for that which I was, hath ſenſibly obliged me; and that the generoſity which you have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in providing me a ſanctuary, and preferring my intereſts before <hi>Solimans</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, merits an eternal acknowledgment. I have alſo obſerved againſt my cuſtom, that you bear an affection to me, and I am ſo powerfully perſwaded of it, as you cannot deſire I ſhould be more: but, my Lord, if I may be permitted to ſpeak freely, I muſt tell you, that the eſteem I make of ſo many rare qualities, as are in you, joyned to the obligations wherein I am engaged to you, could never for all that beget an affection in my heart like unto yours. Yet do not think I am ingrateful, or inſenſible; but contrarily, I love you ſo much the more perfectly, as I can ſpeak it without bluſhing; I, my Lord, I love you with a friendſhip, ſo ſolidly eſtabliſhed, as neither ſenſe nor fortune hath any part in it. I can publiſh it without ſhame, and conſerve it without blame, and loving you as if you were my brother, I do not ſee that you have reaſon to complain. I know well nevertheleſs that you are not ſatisfied; but what would you have me do, if love be a paſſion, whereof I am not capable? and if marriage hath always paſt with me for a captivity, which is to be avoyded as much as poſſibly may be? I proteſt unto you by the holy Prophet, whom we worſhip, that if I could be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this paſſion, it ſhould be doubtleſs for you; never having had that inclination for any one as I have for you. But let not this impoſſibility, I pray you, of my being in love, diſquiet you, ſince the friendſhip, which I promiſe you, is incomparably more excellent, and more perfect. And to teſtifie unto you, that I do all that I can, if you have not power enough to contain your ſelf from deſiring to marry me, I do permit you to uſe the beſt means you can to get the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Soliman</hi> to conſent unto it; which being obtained, I do here engage my word to you no longer to oppoſe your deſires. Behold, my Lord, all that I had to ſay to you; and never hope for any more from me; for <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s vertue can have no further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for your paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Moſt vertuous Princeſs, replyed <hi>Gianger</hi> caſting himſelf at her feet, What occaſions do you give me all at once, both of grief, and of ſatisfaction! with one hand you draw me out of danger, and with the other you put me to death. You cannot anſwer my paſſion, and yet you love me more then all the world beſide; who ever ſaw an adventure equal to mine? my Miſtreſs refuſes me her love, but in ſuch a manner, as I am not permitted to have the comfort to term her cruel and unpitiful; but contrarily, I muſt give her thanks for the wrong ſhe does me, and muſt admire in her the vertue which oppoſes my love. <hi>Gianger,</hi> in ſaying thus, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Axiamira</hi> with ſo much grief, as made me pity him. And whereas the Princeſſes good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath always allowed me a great deal of freedom with her, I took ſo much upon me as to intermeddle in their diſcourſe; ſo that addreſſing my ſelf to the Prince, The permiſſion, my Lord, ſaid I unto him, which hath been given you, ſhould inſpire you, me-thinks, with other thoughts, then thoſe which I perceive you have. Ah! my Princeſs, ſaid he unto me, (for he had always called me ſo, ever after we had put that trick upon him,) that which the goodneſs of <hi>Axiamira</hi> grants, Fortune refuſes me; interpoſing ſuch obſtacles as are not eaſie to be vanquiſhed: And in the ſtate wherein things are, there needs a ſupernatural power to change my evil deſtiny, unleſs you will help me to perſwade <hi>Axiamira,</hi> that ſhe will permit me to marry her; for being then no longer in a condition to be <hi>Deliment</hi>'s wife, or <hi>Soliman</hi>'s Miſtreſs, the knowledg thereof would peradventure make their weapons fall out of their hands. How! ſaid <hi>Axiamira</hi> mightily ſurprized, have the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Soliman</hi> any intereſts to be decided between them? Is it known that I am in your hands? and may I be ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to be the cauſe of the deſolation of my Country? <hi>Gianger</hi> was very ſorry that he had ſaid ſo much before he was aware; but ſeeing the matter paſt remedy, and that likewiſe this War could not be always concealed from <hi>Axiamira,</hi> he recounted unto her, that a little after her ſhipwrack the War began between the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Soliman,</hi> without any other apparant cauſe thereof known, then that he had been told how you alone had made him undertake it; though the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s ſubjects had contributed ſome pretext thereunto by the acts of hoſtility
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60144:146"/> which they had committed in <hi>Comagena;</hi> and then he acquainted her with the victories which you had obtained againſt the <hi>Sophi,</hi> and the conqueſts which you had made: He vowed unto her, that neither he, nor his brother had contributed any thing to this War; that it had been concluded, before they were advertiſed of it; that not having a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Confident about the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> then you, they could not oppoſe this deſign, whereof you had been the principall cauſe; and that all they could do, had been to find out Pretexts not to be preſent in it. In fine, <hi>Gianger</hi> told her all things, except what regarded <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama,</hi> of whom he ſpake not at all: and by that which I could judge of it, he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that ſort, becauſe being ignorant of the affection which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> bore me, and believing that he would be glad to return into his Country, if he met with an occaſion for it; he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the Princeſſe, who had often ſpoken to him of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> zeal and fidelity, would quickly give him intelligence of her being there, and then that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> to ſee his Native Soil again, and to be well received there, would perſwade the Princeſs to return thither. And it may be alſo, as all Lovers are ſuſpicious, that he had ſurmized by <hi>Axiamira's</hi> diſcourſe, which he had interpreted amiſſe, how <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was in love with her; at leaſtwiſe I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I will not tell you, my Lord, in what aſtoniſhment the Princeſſe was to hear of the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Such were in this incounter <hi>Axiamira's</hi> expreſſions; and as for me, I confeſſe too with confuſion, that the Princes diſcourſe gave me an unquietneſſe, which was particular to me.</p>
                  <p>For having had no news of <hi>Vlama,</hi> ſince the time that he departed from the Court, I could not judge what he had done during ſo great a diſorder; this thought troubled me ſo much, as I could not forbear demanding of <hi>Gianger,</hi> whether he knew not what was become of <hi>Vlama?</hi> and whereas I was afraid, leaſt the Princeſſe ſhould condemn me for thinking of <hi>Vlama,</hi> rather then comforting her, I looked on her at the very ſame inſtant, which, as I think, confirmed <hi>Gianger</hi> the more in the opinion, that I have told you, I believed he had. For after he had conſidered me, and then the Princeſs, he told me, that this War having much afflicted him, he knew not very well what had paſſed in it. But to abridge my diſcourſe, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Sarraida</hi> were called in, as well to comfort the Princeſs, as to adviſe on that which they were to do. And whenas <hi>Gianger</hi> had requeſted the Princeſs, ſhe would permit him to tell <hi>Muſtapha</hi> what ſhe had granted him, ſhe anſwered him, that never doing or ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, which ſhe would have to be concealed, he might acquaint him with all that he pleaſed. As ſoon as <hi>Muſtapha</hi> appeared, ſhe advanced towards him, And will you, my Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, be ſo generous, as not to hate a perſon, who weeps for the victories of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman?</hi> and who ſheds tears when ſhe ſees the bounds of an Empire, which is deſtined to you inlarged?

To which end they choſe out an old Officer of <hi>Giangers,</hi> whom they ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with order to tell you the truth of all things. But by ill fortune, you were gone away before, upon a ſecret expedition, wherein <hi>Soliman</hi> had imployed you, although it was but four or five daies after the Triumph, which was celebrated for him at your return from <hi>Perſia.</hi> In the mean time, to facilitate things on all ſides, they believed it would not be amiſſe for <hi>Axiamira</hi> to write once more to ſome one of her ancient friends, and that by this Letter, he, to whom ſhe ſhould addreſſe her ſelf, ſhould be obliged to acquaint the <hi>Sophi</hi> that ſhe was living; and that he ſhould alſo dextrouſly inform himſelf, whether by a marriage of her with a Son of <hi>Solimans,</hi> a peace might not be propounded. The Princeſs ſaid hereupon, that ſhe would never make this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but <hi>Muſtapha</hi> anſwered her, how it would ſuffice, if ſhe did only write a letter, that did make known ſhe was living; and that did likewiſe aſſure, how the letter, which he would write, was of a perſon conſiderable and powerfull enough, to treat of an Affair of this importance.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs, after ſhe had a little thought on it, wrote to the Governor of <hi>Sultania,</hi> who had been alwaies very much affected to her; and by this letter ſhe conjured him to work the <hi>Sophi</hi> to a peace all that ever he could. But before the publiſhing of her being alive, and making the Propoſition, which he ſhould find in the letter, he ſhould ſend her his Opinion, and acquaint her in what terms <hi>Deliment</hi> ſtood with the <hi>Sophi,</hi> whom ſhe denoted unto him, without naming him: ſhe moreover aſſured him, that the Letter then written unto him, came from a perſon, who was able to perform all that he would undertake; and he that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, had order to name him, even <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> The Princes choſe a man for this voyage, who had lived a long time in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that underſtanding the Language and Cuſtomes of it, could eaſily get to <hi>Sultania,</hi> when once he had put on the habit of the Country. This Governor, having with extream joy learnt that the Princeſs was living, and tranſported more by zeal then diſcretion, went; without doing ought that the Princeſſe had injoyned him, to Prince <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> who had been ſet at liberty, as well as my Father, when as nothing could be proved againſt them. For I forgot to tell you, how they had been made priſoners, out of an opinion conceived, that they had cauſed us to be carried away. This man, I ſay, tranſported with an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate zeal, went to Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and reading the Princeſs Letter to him, together with that from <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> they concluded together, that this Propoſition would but exaſperate things, knowing very well that <hi>Deliment</hi> would never conſent to a peace, which put <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> into the power of another, and therefore that it would but inflame the War the more, inſtead of extinguiſhing it.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who was not ignorant how much averſe the Princeſs had ever been from Marriage, could not believe, but that the conſent which ſhe ſeemed to give to <hi>Muſtapha's</hi> Propoſition, was wholly againſt her inclination: ſo that thinking to ſerve her, and conſidering withall, that if ſhe became the Wife of one of <hi>Solimans</hi> Sons, he ſhould loſe her for ever, and me too, becauſe he knew well that I would never abandon her, and that <hi>

                  <p>This Letter being conſigned into the hands of him that had been ſent, and he newly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a ſcruple came into the Princes minde, and a fear that <hi>Axiamira</hi> would be diſpleaſed with him for this deceiving of her; ſo that inſtantly he diſpatched away a Gentleman, that was faithful to him, to the Princeſs at <hi>Amaſia,</hi> for to advertiſe her of the truth of things; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60144:147"/> to tell her, that if ſhe would return to <hi>Perſia,</hi> his deſign was to lay an ambuſh by the means of the Governor of <hi>Sultania</hi> for the taking her out of <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s hands, if he conducted her to that frontire Town, whereof the Letter, which he had cauſed to be written to him in the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s name, ſpake. But whil'ſt he who had been ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was returning to tell us that you were not there; and that they which came from <hi>Sultania</hi> with ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Meſſages, were upon their way towards us, there were ſtrange things a contriving in the <hi>Serraglio;</hi> and the cruel <hi>Roxelana,</hi> making profit of your abſence, meditated deadly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.

                  <p>But I am carryed away, my Lord, in commending theſe two infortunate Princes, without thinking, how you knew them, not better, but longer then I.

So that this wicked woman, judging how all that ſhe could ſay would no longer be ſuſpected, one day, when as ſhe ſhewed one of theſe Letters to <hi>Soliman</hi> which commended the Prince; My Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, (as good <hi>Achmat</hi> recounted it unto us, who underſtood all theſe particularities from <hi>Soliman</hi>'s own mouth) may I dare give thee one mark of my love, in giving thee one of my fear? All that proceeds from ſo noble a cauſe, anſwered the <hi>Sultan,</hi> cannot be but very agreeable unto me.

He thanked <hi>Roxela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for the care ſhe had of the good of his <hi>State;</hi> and aſſured her that he ſhould never take any thing ill which ſhe ſhould ſay to him. That for <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> he beleeved him to be too well born to pluck away the Scepter from him, and to deſpoyl him of an Empire, that was deſtined to him after his death. <hi>Roxelana,</hi> ſeeing that this artifice wrought not all the effect ſhe expected from it, conſults anew with the Traytor <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who told her, that at any rate whatſoever <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was to be made away before you were returned to the Port, and that the eaſieſt way for it would be to ſeek to poyſon him; for which purpoſe they were to ſend a daring and faithful man, with good ſtore of money, to corrupt ſome one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Officers, that waited on him at his Table. But ſeeing a great deal of hazard in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, ſhe could hardly reſolve on it, yet had ſhe conſented unto it, had not an accident fallen out, which made her change her reſolution. But, my Lord, admire here the ſtrange proceeding of things of this world! whil'ſt <hi>Roxelana</hi> and <hi>Ruſtan</hi> ſought for means to deſtroy <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and that all their malice could finde out none, that could fully ſatisfie their cruel hatred, the zeal and fidelity of one of the ancient Officers of this deplorable Prince, furniſhed them with an occaſion for it. This man had been his firſt Governor, when as he went out of the <hi>Serraglio;</hi> and was he to whom <hi>Soliman,</hi> during the youth of his ſon, had given in charge to render him an account of his actions: But whereas the Prince had never done any, but ſuch as were worthy, he could not advertiſe ought, that was not to the advantage of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Now after that <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s age had diſpenſed him from the obedience, which he had yeelded to this man, he had ſtill retained him at <hi>Amaſia;</hi> converſing a little leſs familiarly with him, then with his other domeſticks, by reaſon he was of ſomewhat an auſtere humor, and that his former authority did as yet conſerve ſome awe and reſpect in <hi>Muſtapha</hi> towards him. This man for all that loved the Prince extreamly, who on the other ſide heaped wealth and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity on him. Howbeit he had a ſcrupulous vertue, which perſwaded him, that though he held nothing of that which he enjoyed but from <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> yet that he owed all to <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who had placed him about him; ſo that without conſidering the Princes intereſts, as ſoon as <hi>Soliman</hi>'s came to be in competition with them, he betook him to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s party. This man then, being of the humor I have repreſented unto you, was at <hi>Amaſia,</hi> whil'ſt the Princeſs and I were there; And though he knew that there were two women in his Maſters Palace, who were not known, or ſeen, yet had he not made an affair of <hi>State</hi> of it, but had beleeved that which had been told him, as well as other of the Princes Officers, how we were two of <hi>Sarraida's</hi> kinſwomen, who for certain reaſons would not be ſeen of any body. But it chanced for our ill hap, that this man walking out of the Town encountred that which cauſed all our misfortune. For to clear this Hiſtory unto you, pleaſe you to underſtand, that he whom the Princeſs had ſent to <hi>Sultania,</hi> having been overtaken by him whom Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> had diſpatched away preſently after him, they had travelled together, without knowing that they were come from one and the ſame place, and were going to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So that falling in talk of indifferent things (for the <hi>Perſian</hi> underſtood the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tongue well) and the War, which was then betwixt the <hi>Sophi</hi> and the <hi>Sultan,</hi> being the ſubject of the converſation of all thoſe which knew not one another, they grew ſo hot in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60144:148"/> diſcourſing about it the very day wherein they were to arrive at <hi>Amaſia,</hi> as the <hi>Perſian,</hi> not able to diſguiſe his thoughts, as he had done his language and his habit, burſt out into ſaying, that <hi>Soliman</hi> was an Uſurper; which the other unable to endure, and being become more audacious, becauſe he was nigh to a place where he knew he ſhould be protected, he drew out his ſcimitar, and very fiercely ſet upon the <hi>Perſian,</hi> who, being more dextrous, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mounted then he, quickly decided the combate with three blows that he gave him, which made him fall dead at his feet. This being done without witneſſes, the <hi>Perſian</hi> continued his way, and almoſt a minute after he was out of ſight, <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s ſaid ancient Governor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the place where the combate was fought, and preſently knowing that man, becauſe he had belonged to the Prince, he approached to him, marks whether he gives any ſign of life, and laying his hand upon the region of his heart, he meets there with the pacquet that was directed to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> which that man had put into a little bag that he had hung about his neck. The ſight hereof poſſeſt the Governor with ſome curioſity, ſo that ſeeing no mark of life in that wretched man, but contrarily obſerving all the ſigns of death in him, which are wont to be ſeen in them whoſe end hath been violent, he ſpeedily withdrew from that ſame place, carrying the little bag along with him; and being got far enough out of the way, he opened it, and was much abaſhed, when he perceived the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s ſeal.</p>
                  <p>I leave you to judg, my Lord, whether that exact fidelity, which he had always obſerved to <hi>Soliman,</hi> did permit him to deliberate long upon that ſubject: he never ſtuck at it then; and to teſtifie his reſpect to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as well as his fidelity, he reſolves to ſend him thoſe Letters without opening them. And ſeeing by the ſuperſcription of that which was directed to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> that ſhe muſt needs be in <hi>Amaſia,</hi> he reflected on the being of two women concealed in <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Palace; and calling to minde an hundred petty circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which when they arrived had made no impreſſion in his minde, he certainly beleeved, that the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was in <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s hands: So that perſwaded of this truth, he re-entred into the Town through another gate then that which he went out at; and without making ſhew of what had befallen him, he the next day diſpatches a man away to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> enjoyns him to addreſs himſelf to ſome of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s for to preſent him to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and commands him above all things to uſe great ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Perſian</hi> being arrived at <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and not fearing to be accuſed for the death of him whom he had killed, ſince their combate had been without witneſſes, he comes boldly to the Palace, demands to ſpeak with <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and after he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known to him to be a <hi>Perſian,</hi> and had given him aſſured marks that he came from Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> he deſires to be admitted to the Princeſs; which was granted him. And when he had acquitted him of his Commiſſion, <hi>Axiamira</hi> remained very much ſurprized; for ſhe knew by his diſcourſe, that he whom they had ſent to <hi>Sultania</hi> was too long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, ſince this man, who ſet forth a day after him, was already come. She hoped never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as well as the Princes, that this unquietneſs would ſoon ceaſe; and beleeved that ſome inconvenience having kept this man from coming ſo faſt as the other, he would arrive at laſt, and ſo give an end to their fear. But the day following, the body of him, whom the <hi>Perſian</hi> had ſlain, having been found by ſome that paſſed by, he was brought into the Town, and known to be one belonging to the Prince, who was preſently advertiſed thereof. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was a matter of importance, he went in perſon to cauſe the Letters to be ſearched for, which we beleeved he had hidden ſomewhere in his clothes; but having found none about him, the Princeſs was very much afflicted at it, fearing with a great deal of reaſon, leſt theſe Letters ſhould come into the hands of ſuch, as might give <hi>Soliman</hi> to underſtand that ſhe was in his Dominions. Yet <hi>Gianger</hi> in ſome ſort comforted her, by perſwading her tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this man, who, as he ſaid, was cunning and dextrous, ſeeing himſelf engaged in a combat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, had without doubt thrown them away, for fear they ſhould be found about him, if he ſhould happen to have the worſt in this occaſion. At length, not able to do otherwiſe, ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be ſomewhat perſwaded of it: and after ſhe had conſidered what ſhe was to do, ſhe ſent back the <hi>Perſian</hi> without other anſwer, then that ſhe aſſured Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> of her affection, and that he ſhould within a few days hear from her, not daring to venture more Letters ſo ſoon after this croſs adventure; and deferring alſo the taking of her laſt reſolutions, till they ſhould know what could be expected from you.</p>
                  <p>But when we learnt a little after, by the return of him who had been ſent to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60144:149"/> that you were not there, the unquietneſs of the Princeſs, and of my ſelf, ſtrangely redoubled. Yet we did not know all the occaſions that we had for it: for the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s falſe Letter to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and thoſe which were directed to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> having been delivered to <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> through the ſimplicity of him, which ſhould have given them to none but to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> himſelf, it might be ſaid, how his inconſiderate zeal did that in this occaſion, which all the cunning of <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and the wickedneſs of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> could never have done without him. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> went preſently to her, and opening theſe Letters with a great deal of care to preſerve the Seals of them whole and entire, they found therein wherewithall to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their deſires, and execute their miſchievous deſigns. <hi>Roxelana</hi> took theſe Letters with joy into her charge, and as ſoon as they had ſealed them up again, ſhe ſent word to <hi>Soliman,</hi> that ſhe had ſomething of importance to communicate unto him; whereupon he inſtantly repaired unto her, and was received by her with the accuſtomed reſpect, but with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſadneſs in her countenance, though in her heart ſhe was infinite glad. The <hi>Sultan,</hi> who always loved her dearly, demanded of her with ſome unquietneſs, what it was that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted her? She anſwered him, that being enforced for the good of his Empire, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his perſon, to diſcover a matter unto him, which would much amaze and grieve him, ſhe could not be without affliction. This obſcure diſcourſe having redoubled the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s curioſity, and already even excited ſome trouble in his ſoul, ſhe went on, beſeeching him to remember the ſuſpicions which ſhe had of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> though he had neglected them, and at length intermixing the praiſes of the Prince, with her accuſations againſt him, ſhe preſents the falſe Letter, that was directed to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> unto <hi>Soliman,</hi> tells him (as indeed it was true) that his ancient Governor ſent it unto him; and after ſhe had made him conſider the importance of it, ſhe repreſents unto him, that if <hi>Mustapha</hi> came once to be joyned to <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> it would be eaſie for him to ſeize upon his Throne: That he was not to expect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> againſt the Prince, becauſe his liberality had gained them all; that the people loved him; that the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> feared and eſteemed him; and that <hi>in fine</hi> this affair was ſo important, as it concerned both his Empire, and his life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Soliman</hi> hearing all theſe things, knowing the fidelity of him that ſent him this Letter, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tachmas</hi> ſeal to it; and coming to conſider, that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had with addreſs declined the War of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he no longer doubted but that he was guilty; albeit <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack perplexed him, and kept him from comprehending this pretended marriage. His ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this Prince made him nevertheleſs ſeek in his heart, how he might favorably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the accuſations, which were brought againſt his innocence. But the conjectures were ſo ſtrong, and <hi>Roxelana</hi>'s perſwaſions ſo powerful, as fatherly affection gave place to reaſon of <hi>State.</hi> He would fain have put this affair into the deliberation of his privy Councel, but in regard you were not at the Port, he knew not whom to rely on. He propounded <hi>Achmat</hi> to <hi>Roxelana,</hi> but ſhe, being in fear of this mans vertue, repreſented unto him, that he was too much affected to the Prince to hope for any faithful counſel from him in this encounter. In the end ſhe knew how to ſway the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s minde with ſo much addreſs and malice, as he himſelf commanded <hi>Ruſtan</hi> to be ſent for, who was the onely man that <hi>Roxelana</hi> did not except againſt. He was no ſooner arrived, but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> asked his advice concerning the matter in queſtion. He anſwered at firſt, with a feigned ſubmiſſion, that it was onely for him to execute his Highneſs reſolutions, and not to give him counſel. But after he had cauſed himſelf to be commanded more then once to deliver his opinion, he aggravated the matter with ſo much art, and made ſhew of ſuch dangerous conſequences in this affair if it were neglected, as <hi>Soliman,</hi> being abſolutely reſolved to look to his conſervation, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to make himſelf ready to ſet forth with ſix thouſand men, which ſhould march away under pretext of being ſent to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> as a recruit. That in the mean time, in paſſing by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſia,</hi> he ſhould aſſure himſelf of <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s perſon with as little ſtir as poſſibly he could, for fear of cauſing ſome revolt in that Province.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rustan</hi> having received this Order, thought of nothing but executing it. And whereas the Troops, which he was to conduct, were ready to march, he departed away within a few days, after he had received from <hi>Roxelana</hi> all the inſtructions, that were neceſſary to make the deſign, which ſhe had to ruine <hi>Mustapha,</hi> ſucceed. As indeed, <hi>Rustan</hi> was no ſooner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the frontiers of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> but he wrote unto <hi>Soliman,</hi> that <hi>Mustapha</hi> had gained all the Soldiers; that they would receive no command but from him; that all was full of conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60144:149"/> that the people were every where ready to revolt; that he was not in a condition to oppoſe ſo many Enemies; and in concluſion, that his preſence was abſolutely neceſſary for the calming of this ſtorm. Now that which made <hi>Rustan</hi> advertiſe <hi>Soliman</hi> of all theſe things, was becauſe he certainly knew, that the vertue of <hi>Mustapha</hi> was ſo generally beloved in all that Province, as if he undertook to go with open force againſt him, he would be in danger of being loſt, and of utterly ruining <hi>Roxelana</hi>'s deſigns. He conſidered withall, that if he conducted the Prince to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> all the <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> all the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and all the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This conſideration of his ſucceeded but too well; for <hi>Soliman</hi> no ſooner underſtood ſo much from him, but he reſolved for his voyage. Howbeit that which powerfully carryed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m to do what <hi>Rustan</hi> deſired, was the intelligence he gave him, how by a ſecond Letter from <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Governor he was informed, that the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was in his hands. So that <hi>Soliman,</hi> filled with choller and jealouſie, and thinking that as <hi>Rustan</hi> had eſcaped ſhipwrack, ſo <hi>Axiamira</hi> not being dead might be in the hands of his ſon, who was fallen in love with her, parted inſtantly away, with all the Troops and <hi>Janizaries</hi> which he had about him; leaving no more behinde then ſuch as were neceſſary for the ordinary guard of his <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi> But before he went from <hi>Roxelana,</hi> ſhe made him promiſe her, that he would forget all things to think of his own ſecurity. Vertuous <hi>Achmat</hi> told us ſince, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had a ſtrange combate within himſelf, and that Nature and Reaſon a long time oppoſed the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of this woman. But at length ſhe made him ſee the peril ſo great, and ſo neer unto h m, as in parting from her, ſhe got him to promiſe her two things; the one, that he ſhould not ſee <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and the other, that he ſhould ſacrifice him to his own proper ſafety. With this deadly reſolution he went and joyned with <hi>Ruſtan:</hi> theſe things nevertheleſs were not ſo cloſely carryed, but the <hi>Baſſa Achmat</hi> was advertiſed, how this tempeſt was going to fall upon the head of <hi>Mustapha;</hi> ſo that at the very ſame time, when as <hi>Soliman,</hi> being encamped neer to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> had ſent the Prince a Command to come unto him, to render him an account of the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia, Achmat</hi> diſpatched away a Poſt, to advertiſe him that ſome great deſign was plotting againſt him, and that he was accuſed of ſomething, wherein the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was mentioned: but not able to tell him preciſely what it was, all that he could do in this occaſion, conſidering the ſtate wherein he ſaw things, was to counſel him not to come.</p>
                  <p>I leave you to judg, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> whether, receiving at one and the ſame inſtant <hi>Soliman</hi>'s command, and <hi>Achmat</hi>'s advertiſement, the Princes and the Princeſs were not ſtrangely ſurprized; And ſo much the more, becauſe that <hi>Perſian</hi> was on the very ſame day brought back to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> whom <hi>Axiamira</hi> had returned to Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and had been taken upon the frontire for a ſpy, though he beleeved, that it was for that it had been diſcovered, how he had ſlain that Officer of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s, which came out of <hi>Perſia</hi> with him; ſo that he no ſooner ſaw the Prince, but he caſt himſelf at his feet, confeſſed his crime, begged his pardon for it, and recounted unto him the combate between that <hi>Turk</hi> and him, as I have related it unto you. But whatſoever was demanded of him, he ſtill maintained, that he whom he had killed had not thrown away any Letters during the combate, as we had beleeved; which made us fear more then before, leſt ſome one had gotten them after his death, and ſent them to <hi>Soliman.</hi> Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> was even in deſpair to ſee his brother in trouble for the love of him: <hi>Axiamira</hi> was in an affliction, which I cannot repreſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; the fear of falling into <hi>Soliman</hi>'s hands made her reſolve for death; and the thought of being the cauſe of the ruine of two Princes, to whom ſhe was ſo much obliged, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her grief far more. <hi>Sarraida,</hi> who loved her husband more then her ſelf, was wholly diſſolved into tears, out of her fear of the danger whereunto ſhe ſaw him expoſed; <hi>Mustapha,</hi> though more conſtant, yet was ſenſibly touched with the tears of the reſt; and as for me, if I may be permitted to name my ſelf after ſo many illuſtrious perſons, I was ſo afflicted, as my own misfortunes were never ſo ſenſible to me.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, we knew not what reſolution to take, <hi>Gianger</hi> would go and preſent himſelf to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to juſtifie his brother, and confeſs that he alone was culpable: but as ſoon as he came to think, that he ſhould abandon <hi>Axiamira;</hi> that he ſhould either let her return into <hi>Perſia,</hi> or put her into the hands of <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was both his Father and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60144:150"/> his Rival, he could by no means reſolve on it, but fell again into his deſpair. <hi>Axiamira</hi> on her part found no way to eſcape this peril; ſhe would fain have ſaved theſe two Princes, and ſaved her ſelf too: but not able to go into <hi>Perſia,</hi> neither to ſee <hi>Soliman,</hi> nor reſt ſafe in a place, where ſhe was no longer unknown, ſhe found that death alone could draw her out of ſo many miſeries. As for <hi>Mustapha,</hi> his greateſt ſorrow was to ſee the affliction of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the fear he was in, that his Palace would not be an inviolable ſanctuary to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Axiamira:</hi> for touching the reſt, ſaid he unto her, I am not much troubled. If <hi>Soliman</hi> deals rigorouſly with me, it will always be with injuſtice, knowing as I do, that I have never had a thought againſt the ſervice which I owe to him, and after this ſatisfaction, I fear not death. But that which afflicts me, continued he, is the doubt, that if I go and preſent my ſelf to <hi>Soliman,</hi> they will come and do you ſome wrong in my abſence, and that is it for which I do not ſee how we can finde a remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sarraida,</hi> hearing her husband ſpeak in this ſort, caſt her ſelf at his feet to diſſwade him from this deſign, and to pray him to remember (ſaid ſhe, after ſhe had craved pardon of <hi>Gianger</hi>) how exceedingly <hi>Roxelana</hi> had ſought for a pretext to undo him; that having met with one, he might be aſſured ſhe would make uſe of it to his ruine: and that it was better for him to ſtay in <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and there to defend himſelf, or fly away, then to expoſe himſelf to ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a danger. But <hi>Muſtapha's</hi> generoſity not permitting him to reſolve either for the one or the other; it becomes your affection, anſwered he, to counſel me in this manner, but it becomes not the courage of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to be perſwaded by you: and ſince I am innocent, I will never fly like a guilty man. For <hi>in fine,</hi> though I ſeem to have failed, according to rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and exact policy, in not advertiſing <hi>Soliman</hi> that the daughter of his Enemy was in my power, yet I think that I ſwerve not much from ſoveraign Reaſon in ſerving ſo excellent a Princeſs and my brother; and in contributing nothing to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s unjuſt love, ſo that after this Interior ſatisfaction, I will remit my innocence to the conduct of Heaven, which is always the protector of it. <hi>Gianger</hi> ſeeing his reſolution, deſired <hi>Axiamira,</hi> not to take it ill if he went to dye with his brother; but <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> without giving the Princeſs leaſure to anſwer, told him, that he would not ſuffer it, but he would leave him to guard the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and his dear <hi>Sarraida.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould never have done, if I would report unto you all that, which love, fear, genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and deſpair, made theſe illuſtrious perſons ſay in this ſad converſation. As for me, I heard all their diſcourſe without ſpeaking: when as on a ſudden, the deſire which I had to ſerve them inſpired me with a mean, whereby I beleeved I could ſave <hi>Mustapha,</hi> ſecure <hi>Axiamira,</hi> dry up <hi>Sarraida</hi>'s tears, render <hi>Gianger</hi> more excuſable, ſignalize the affection which I bare the Princeſs, and deſtroy all the wicked deſigns of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Enemies. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this thought poſſeſt me with ſo extraordinary a joy, as it quickly appeared in my eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the tears which I ſhed: but whereas I feared that the Princeſſes generoſity would be an obſtacle to my deſign, I fell at her feet, and beſought her to give me her word, that ſhe would not refuſe a mean, which I thought I had found to draw them all out of the pain and danger wherein I ſaw them. Ah, my dear maid, ſaid ſhe unto me, doſt thou think that a perſon which would receive death with joy, if it were preſented unto her, can refuſe thy aſſiſtance? but I greatly fear, continued ſhe, that thy affection does but abuſe thee, and that the extream deſire thou haſt to ſerve me makes thee beleeve that to be eaſie, which I hold impoſſible. No, no, Madam, anſwered I; and provided you will promiſe me not to oppoſe this deſign, I aſſure you that you your ſelf will finde a great deal of probability in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sarraida,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Axiamira</hi> made not much haſte to anſwer me, preſt her ſo far, as ſhe gave me her word to do all that I would have her. She had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thanks for the permiſſion ſhe gave me to ſerve her, I imparted unto her in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I hoped to ſecure her. And to make her comprehend it the better, I cauſed her to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how the ſame Merchant who ſold her picture to <hi>Soliman,</hi> as being mine, had alſo ſold mine to Prince <hi>Gianger,</hi> as being hers: So that to draw them out of the trouble wherein they were, and to put her in ſafety, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was to conduct me to <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſeeming to beleeve that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia;</hi> which he was likewiſe to confirm by the picture that Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> had of me, and by the teſtimony of the Merchant who had ſold it unto him. And withall <hi>Soliman,</hi> by his own experience, would not have much ado to beleeve, that the Prince might have been deceived, as well as himſelf. That in this ſort <hi>Muſtapha</hi> might deny
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60144:150"/> the having of the right Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> in his hands, and conſequently that ſhe would be in ſafety. That for me, I was to ſay, how having been found on the Sea-ſhoar after our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, they had preſented me to <hi>Sarraida,</hi> who out of her goodneſs had received me into her Palace, where I had almoſt ever ſince been ſick: And that not above eight days before, <hi>Gianger</hi> had ſeen me at his brothers, and taken me for the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by means of my picture that he had. That inſtantly thereupon he purpoſed to have carryed me to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> being ready to ſet forth on that voyage, juſt as he received <hi>Soliman</hi>'s command. I told them further, that if by ill fortune the Letters from <hi>Perſia,</hi> which had been loſt, were in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s hands, he was boldly to deny any knowledg thereof, ſince no body could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of it. And that he was to ſay, how without doubt it was an artifice of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who having underſtood by ſome way, unknown to him, that the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was in his power, had counterfeited thoſe Letters, for to bring him into hatred with <hi>Soliman.</hi> And as for me, ſaid I to the Princeſs, never trouble your ſelf, Heaven, which hath inſpired me with this deſign, knows how to preſerve me, if I be worthy of protection; if not, I ſhall ſtill dye with joy, if I dye for the ſaving of ſo many excellent perſons. Ah, <hi>Felixana!</hi> ſaid the Princeſs unto me, I will not be ſaved with the loſs of you; and if your zeal carries you to this reſolution, reaſon will not let me conſent unto it. You have promiſed it me, Madam; ſaid I interrupting her; and I cannot think that a great Princeſs will ever break her word. And then again I do not ſee that my loſs is undoubted; for howſoever, continued I, <hi>Soliman</hi> cannot accuſe me but for a little while receiving the honors, which were rendered to me as to the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> though I were not ſhe; but thereunto I am to ſay, that to be in the more ſafety out of the reſpect which was beleeved to be due to my condition, I had not diſabuſed the Prince, ſtaying to make my ſelf known for that which I was, till I was at his Highneſs feet, to beg his pardon, and to beſeech him to grant me my liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sarraida,</hi> ſeeing a great deal of likelyhood in that which I ſaid, earneſtly intreated <hi>Axiamira</hi> no longer to reſiſt this deſign. <hi>Gianger</hi> called me his Deliverer, and ſaid ſuch obliging things unto me, as I ſhall never forget the remembrance of them. For <hi>Mustapha,</hi> though he ſaw ſome probability of that which I propounded, yet his great heart could not reſolve to diſguiſe the truth; and had he not certainly known, that it was the only way which could permit him to hope, that he might put the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> in ſafety, he had never conſented unto it. But that conſideration, joyned to the extream affection which he carried to his brother, made him reſolve at length for all that was deſired of him. We prepared our ſelves then to depart the next day; I will not relate unto you what the ſeparation was between the Princeſs and me, between <hi>Gianger</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> between <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Sarraida,</hi> ſince it would but renew our ſorrows for a matter that is not abſolutely neceſſary you ſhould know. But I will only tell you, that the ſeparation of the Soul and body is never made with ſuch violent grief as ours was, at the ſad moment of that deadly and laſt farewell. I was put into a Charet, with two women which <hi>Sarraida</hi> gave me to wait upon me, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> accompanied with a ſmall train, to ſhew the more confidence, marched on horſeback ſome fifty paces before us. We arrived at the Emperors Camp a day later then we thought we ſhould, becauſe the Charet, wherein I was, being broken, took up ſo much time to re-accommodate it. And you will know, my Lord, by the ſequel of my diſcourſe, how it is not without cauſe that I have noted this unto you. We were no ſooner lighted at a Tent, which had been prepared for us, but Prince <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who thought he ſhould have conducted me to <hi>Soliman,</hi> received an Order to attend his Commandments there, and to remit me into the hands of a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who was to preſent me to his Highneſs. I confeſs that this proceeding amazed me, and that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be in fear for the Prince. At the very ſame inſtant he received ſundry advices, that his ruine was reſolved and certain, if he did not repel force with force: the Chieftains of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> gave him to underſtand, that if he would they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and not only ſave his life, but ſet the Crown upon his head. To all this he anſwered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſave that he might well be unhappy, but he could never be guilty; that he had rather dye with injuſtice, then raign unjuſtly; and <hi>in ſine</hi> that their zeal going too far for the love of him, he could not recompence them better for it, then in keeping them from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As for me, when I went out of his Tent with tears in my eyes, he requeſted me, that at my coming before <hi>Soliman</hi> I ſhould obtain of him, that he might in perſon juſtifie himſelf of the accuſations that were brought againſt his innocency; and that he would be ſo good as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60144:151"/> not to condemn him without hearing him. I promiſed him all that he deſired of me, without ſcarcely knowing what I did, ſo much was my mind troubled, through the fear I was in, that my deſign would not ſucceed. Howbeit I ſtrove to ſettle my countenance before I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before <hi>Soliman;</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi> that conducted me had the goodneſs not to haſten me too much, ſo that I had the leaſure to recollect my ſelf a little. I was made to paſs through three Tents, before I arrived at the <hi>Sultans,</hi> but every one that I ſaw ſeemed ſo ſad unto me, and I heard <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſo often named ſoftly, as from that very time I perceived but too well that he was utterly loſt.</p>
                  <p>At my firſt appearance <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeemed to be very much ſurprized; and beholding me with an angry look, he demanded of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> that brought me, where the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was? My Lord, ſaid he unto him, Prince <hi>Muſtapha</hi> delivered no other then this perſon unto me, whom I ſaw him treat as if ſhe were the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia.</hi> I no ſooner heard this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (for I had already learned a little of your language) but I caſt my ſelf at the <hi>Sultans</hi> feet, and humbly beſought him to hear me. I will hear no lying, anſwered he. My Lord, replyed I, it is not to keep thy Highneſs from puniſhing it, that I beg the favor of thee to be heard, but to keep thee from confounding the innocent with the guilty; for <hi>in fine,</hi> my Lord, I am faulty, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> is abſolutely innocent. I would I had given thee, anſwered the <hi>grand Signior</hi> thereupon, the half of my Empire, that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> were not guilty. My Lord, replyed I with more confidence then before, I do crave but two things of thee to give thee that ſatisfaction; the one is, that thou wilt hear me without interrupting me; and the other, that thou wilt permit the Prince to juſtifie himſelf in perſon. This laſt, anſwered he, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but for the other I do grant it thee; and promiſe thee moreover, that if thou doſt juſtifie <hi>Muſtapha</hi> (which I do not believe thou canſt do) there is nothing which thou ſhalt not obtain of me. I did not yield at the very firſt; I beſought him that he would ſee the Prince; I labored to vanquiſh him with my reaſons; but at laſt ſeeing I nothing prevailed, I declared the matter unto him, as we had reſolved it; and that with ſo much ingenuity, as I well perceived he beleeved me. I repeated this Hiſtory from <hi>Ruſtans</hi> arrival at <hi>Mazanderon,</hi> and coming to ſpeak of our ſhipwrack, I lamented the loſs of the Princeſs, I ſpake of her as beleeving her to be dead; and recounted alſo, how <hi>Sarraida</hi> had received me from thoſe, who had found me on the Sea-ſhoar; and conſequently, how a little before Prince <hi>Gianger,</hi> having ſeen me with <hi>Sarraida,</hi> where I had been for the moſt part ſick, had beleeved that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by reaſon of a picture which he had of me, and which a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who had deceived him, had ſold him for <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s: I told him moreover, that as ſoon as <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was perſwaded, that I was the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he had prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the conducting of me to his Highneſs. That for me, I had not diſabuſed him, as well to be the more ſecured, as for that I hoped I ſhould the more eaſily obtain my liberty, when as I ſhould requeſt it of him by the memory of the infortunate <hi>Axiamira.</hi>

                     <hi>Soliman,</hi> moved with my words, fetched a great ſigh, and teſtified both by his carriage and his diſcourſe, that he was afflicted for the loſs of the Princeſs; and yet that he had ſome joy, in regard he could hope that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was not ſo faulty as he had beleeved him to be, and that in the end he might juſtifie himſelf. In this thought, the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſpake very gently unto me; and truly I muſt acknowledg, that I never ſaw a more charming Majeſty, then that of this Prince. But, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> of how ſhort a continuance was that happy inſtant! for you muſt know, that <hi>Rustan,</hi> the wickedeſt of men, ſet forth with <hi>Soliman</hi>'s conſent at that very time, when as <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was ſent for to come to the Camp: but he went to <hi>Amaſia</hi> through a by-way, followed by a thouſand archers on horſeback; having ſent two ſpies into that Town, to advertiſe him when <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was gone from thence, to the end he might take <hi>Sarraida,</hi> and from her draw out the truth, in caſe the Prince ſhould deny it: this cunning brain imagining, that a jealous woman would be capable of telling all. But the principal ſubject of that voyage, was to ſeize upon the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> if the Prince did not bring her along with him; and to ſearch in <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Cabinet for ſome other Letters from the <hi>Sophi,</hi> which might alſo convince him of intelligence with the Enemies of the <hi>State.</hi> So that one day after we were parted from <hi>Amaſia Rustan</hi> arrived there, with an abſolute Order, to him that commanded in that place in the abſence of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> to obey <hi>Rustan</hi> as if it were his Highneſs himſelf. You know, my Lord, that theſe kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands do ſeldom finde any rebellious in this Empire: and ſince there have been many times

                  <p>I leave you to imagine in what a caſe this Prince was when he beheld <hi>Ruſtan</hi> at <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>'s Palace gate, followed by ſo great a number of armed men. The firſt thing he did, was to go with ſpeed to <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s lodging, either to endevor the ſaving of her, or to dye in her defence. But this thought of affection was that, which cauſed her to be taken the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for <hi>Rustan</hi> had no ſooner marked the way which <hi>Gianger</hi> took, but leaving one part of his forces at the gate, he followed the Prince in haſte with the other, even to <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s chamber, whereinto he entred by force with him.

In the mean time, to ſeparate <hi>Gianger</hi> from the Princeſs, <hi>Rustan</hi> told him that he had a matter of importance to communicate unto him; but the Prince anſwered him, that having no intereſt ſevered from <hi>Axiamira,</hi> he might ſpeak before her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruſtan</hi> ſurprized with the liberty of this diſcourſe, began to deal in another manner; and letting <hi>Gianger</hi> ſee the abſolute power which he had, he put the Princeſs into deſpair, and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anger</hi> into fury, who, without conſidering that his reſiſtance would render him culpable, left not, quite unarmed as he was, to do ſtrange things in oppoſition of <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force. He would have ſnatched <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s ſcimitar from him, to have uſed it againſt him, and doubtleſs he had done it, if thoſe with whom he was accompanyed had not hindred him. He ſought all about the chamber for ſomething wherewith he might have defended himſelf; but at length ſeeing all his endevors vain, he paſt from one extremity to another, and after he had exceedingly reviled him, he on a ſudden conjured him with tears in his eyes, that he would have ſome pity on him in the perſon of the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira;</hi> that he would remember he was the ſon of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> whoſe daughter he had marryed, being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if the <hi>Sultana</hi> his Mother knew his deſigns, ſhe would approve of them; that he would conſider how <hi>Muſtapha</hi> coming one day to raign, he could not meet with a better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſecure his fortune, then to oblige him in this encounter; that beſides, knowing how conſiderable the intereſts of the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen were to him, he found that he ſhould not do her any very good ſervice in conducting a Princeſs to <hi>Soliman,</hi> with whom he was deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe things, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> anſwered with an inſolent coldneſs, how he remembred very well, that he was the ſon of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and for that onely reaſon <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould not know of the reſiſtance he made to the execution of his commandments; that he feared not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging of <hi>Roxelana</hi> by conducting <hi>Axiamira</hi> to his Highneſs, ſince ſhe could be but his Slave, and that <hi>Roxelana</hi> would always be the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen. His Slave I anſwered <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anger</hi> and <hi>Axiamira</hi> both together, ſurprized with ſo inſolent a ſpeech, that ſhall never be. I ſhould abuſe your patience, if I ſhould repeat unto you all that love, fury, and deſpair, made Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> ſay upon this occaſion; and all that ſorrow and generoſity put into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes mouth in ſo grievous an encounter: but in concluſion they muſt give way to force, and obey <hi>Sarraida</hi> alſo had a command to enter into a charet with <hi>Axiamira,</hi> which ſhe did without any reſiſtance, as ſoon as ſhe had obtained, that an onely ſon, which ſhe had, ſhould not abandon her; but contrarily, ſhe ſeemed to have ſome conſolation, out of the thought that ſhe was going to meet with her dear <hi>Muſtapha</hi> again. As for <hi>Gianger, Rustan</hi> told him, that he might do what he pleaſed, but this Prince was not in an eſtate to reaſon upon that he had to do. It is eaſie for you to comprehend the deplorable condition wherein he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and what the ſeparation was between that Prince and the Princeſs. He earneſtly deſired
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60144:152"/> her to think of her conſervation; and to comfort her in ſome ſort, he told her, how he hoped that <hi>Soliman</hi> could not reſiſt her tears; that he had a great and generous ſoul; and that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided love did not prove ſtronger in him then reaſon, he was moſt aſſured that ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main very well ſatisfied of him; that in the mean time he promiſed to do all things poſſible for her ſervice; and that if by ill fortune he ſaw things deſperate, he would deſpair himſelf, and at leaſt-wiſe for the love of her, ſince he had not been able to live for her. A diſcourſe ſo tender drew tears from the fair eyes of the Princeſs, as ſhe aſſured me afterwards. She reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out her hand to him in turning away her head to conceal her weeping from him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that whatſoever Fortune could do, ſhe ſhould never deſtroy the friendſhip and eſteem which ſhe had for him: That ſhe promiſed him, for a teſtimony that ſhe would not be ingrateful, to think as much of the conſervation of <hi>Mustapha,</hi> as of her own, and not to attempt any thing on her life, if nothing were attempted on her honor. This diſcourſe had laſted longer, if cruel <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who had been buſie in ordering of his men, had not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them, and cauſed the Princeſſes, and the little Prince to part away, whom he placed in the midſt of the thouſand Archers, which had accompanyed him thither. <hi>Gianger</hi> ſeeing he could enterprize nothing for the ſaving of the inconſolable <hi>Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, my Lord, I have, already told you, I think, that <hi>Ruſtan</hi> arrived at <hi>Amaſia</hi> the next day after <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and I were gone from thence; ſo that our voyage having laſted a day longer then it ſhould have done, by reaſon of that breaking of the charet, whereof, if I be not miſtaken, I have ſpoken to you before; and <hi>Ruſtan</hi> having cauſed the Princeſſes to ſet forth two hours after his arrival; chance, or to ſay better, our ill fortune, brought the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about with ſo ſtrange a juſtneſs of time, that at the very ſame inſtant, when as I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching <hi>Soliman</hi> by the memory of the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira;</hi> when as I was lamenting her untimely death, and was all in tears with the grief that I ſaid I was in for her loſs, I ſaw her come in followed by <hi>Sarraida,</hi> and conducted by <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who at the very firſt named her to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> To tell you, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> what a caſe I was in, and that which this ſight effected both in <hi>Soliman</hi>'s minde and mine, is abſolutely impoſſible for me: the <hi>Sultan</hi> beheld me with an eye of indignation and fury, and turning himſelf towards me, he ſaid unto me with a ſtrong and impetuous voyce; <hi>Is it in this ſort then, that thou juſtifieſt</hi> Muſtapha! <hi>but know,</hi> continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It was but for <hi>Soliman</hi> that ſhe was dead! or to ſay better, it is but for the happy <hi>Muſtapha</hi> that ſhe hath eſcaped the Sea, and is living. I know very well that the violence of the love, which I was in for her beauty, hath made me commit one againſt her, which ſeems to make me unworthy of her affection; but the tears which I have ſhed for her loſs, have throughly defaced that crime. In the mean time, O pitileſs Enemy! whil'ſt I ſigh for her death, whil'ſt I ſhed tears, and conſume my ſelf with grief, the happy <hi>Muſtapha</hi> laughs at my tears and ſighs, becomes my Rival, or to ſay better, mine Enemy, and the Enemy of mine Empire, in retaining a perſon whom I loved, or to regard the matter with another face, in retaining the daughter of mine Enemy; in making ſecret Treaties with him, and in deſiring without doubt to pull me out of my Throne, for to place you and himſelf there. For to think, that <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> hath not underſtood from you by what adventure you ſuffered ſhipwrack, is that which I will never be perſwaded to. To beleeve, that he hath treated this marriage without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprive me of my Crown, is very improbable. I have ſuch proofs of it, as cannot be deſtroyed, and nothing can make me beleeve the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Yet I, my Lord, muſt undertake to do it, ſaid the generous <hi>Axiamira,</hi> to whom he had ſtill ſpoken in her own Tongue, and with a diſcourſe, wherein the very truth ſhall appear, make thee know, that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> is not culpable, that <hi>Sarraida</hi> is innocent, and that this maid, whom thy Highneſs beholds with ſo much choller (ſaid ſhe, in ſpeaking of me) merits extream praiſe, for expoſing her ſelf to the peril, wherein I finde her, onely to ſave me. <hi>In fine,</hi> my Lord, I purpoſe to ſhew thee, that if this tempeſt, which I ſee is riſen in thy ſoul, cannot be appeaſed without falling on the head of ſome one, it muſt be upon mine, for that I am the

But do not believe, that in hearing me acknowledg this innocent crime, I have forgotten thine, or that I am baſe enough to flatter thee: no, no, I ſtill remember that I am the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s daughter, and that with a uſage unworthy of my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one of thy Slaves carried me away by force. But whereas the preſervation of them that I love is dearer to me then mine own, I will not ſpeak to thee in this occaſion but of thoſe, in favor of whom Nature ſpeaks to thee as well as I.</p>

I am undone, replyed <hi>Gianger,</hi> love or choller hath been the cauſe of this Command, and howſoever it be, I am equally unhappy. Comfort your ſelf, ſaid the Princeſs to him, and be ſure that <hi>Axiamira</hi> will never do any thing unworthy of her birth, of her courage, and of the eſteem which you have of her: But in the mean time if it be poſſible endeavor to aſſiſt Prince <hi>Mustapha.</hi>

Not being able to do otherwiſe then, he went to <hi>Achmat</hi>'s Tent, there to attend his return, with a great deal of grief and impatience. He ſaw his brother accuſed and in danger for the love of him, his ſiſter in law in priſon, and his Miſtreſs in the hands of his father and his Rival, and of a Prince that was both the Lover and the Enemy of <hi>Axiamira.</hi> He equally feared the hatred and the love of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and there was not any of all the paſſions, of whoſe effects he was not

He anſwered him, that the more <hi>Soliman</hi> had loved him, the more ingrateful he was in betraying him; that the brave things he had done, were not ſo much for the good of the Empire, as for the ruine of it, ſince he did not make uſe of the reputation he had gotten, and of the rare qualities which were in him, but to ſubborn the Commanders and Soldiers, and prepare them for a Revolt, when need ſhould require, as <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had been well advertiſed of it a good while before; that moreover, <hi>Mustapha</hi> did not believe he ſhould ſtain his reputation, in going about to ſet the Crown on his own head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaying till the death of the Emperor ſhould give it him lawfully, ſeeing there were dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Examples of ſuch like things in the <hi>Othoman</hi> Family, which ſeemed to authorize it; that the lives of Kings and Fathers had not always been ſacred and inviolable to their ambitious children: whereby this wicked man denoted, without naming him, cruel <hi>Selim,</hi> the father of <hi>Soliman,</hi> who had made away his; to the end, that an example ſo freſh and ſenſible might make the more impreſſion in his Soul, and might give him a ſtronger and juſter fear of his ſon; that this affair was no way intricate to them who had nothing elſe in recommendation but the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s intereſt; that the knowledg of the matter being ſo certain, <hi>Soliman</hi> was not to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of being vanquiſhed by the motions of Nature in ſeeing his ſon, for fear of being vanquiſhed a ſecond time by him in a more dangerous manner; that it was not neceſſary <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſhould condemn himſelf by his own confeſſion, ſince the Laws condemned him; that clemency indeed was a great vertue, but leſs needful then juſtice; that it was never to be made uſe of but towards the weak, and the other to be always exerciſed againſt the mighty; that in the eſtate wherein things were, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> could not be ſaved without putting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And then after he had confeſſed unto him the Order he had given <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go with all ſpeed to revoke it. But, my Lord, there was no more time for it, becauſe as ſoon as <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had gotten permiſſion to exerciſe his cruelty, the wicked man had taken four Mutes along with him, having each of them a Bow-ſtring in his hand, for in that manner it is, as you know, that the children of the Royal Family are here put to deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Tyger ſtaying without the Tent with them that had accompanied him, as well to keep any body from entring, as to hear what this miſerable Prince would ſay in breathing out his laſt, his Executioners began to attempt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of their charge.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Muſtapha</hi> firſt ſaw theſe four Mutes enter, he made no doubt but he was loſt; yet being ſtrong and courageous, he could not reſolve to ſuffer himſelf to be ſtrangled without ſome defence. The firſt that would have put the ſtring about his neck, he layd at his feet, the like he did to the ſecond; and having put himſelf in a poſture that he could not be ſeized upon behind, he not a little troubled his Executioners.

The people have bruted abroad, how by a communication that was there, from <hi>Soliman</hi>'s Tent to <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s, that Prince had the cruelty to excite the Mutes to ſtrangle his ſon; but very far from that, <hi>Achmat</hi> arrived within a moment after <hi>Mustapha</hi> expired, who, as I have told you, came to change the fatal Order, which <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had but two well executed. This Prince was no ſooner dead, but <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> as if ſome glory would have redounded to him by ſo barbarous an act, went to render <hi>Soliman</hi> an accompt of it, without knowing ought of the alteration of his mind; for <hi>Achmat</hi> had been ſo ſurprized and afflicted to find this Prince, to whom he was bringing life, already dead, as he had not ſaid

                  <p>This firſt motion of ſorrow being over, the vertuous <hi>Achmat</hi> believed that he owed the conſervation of <hi>Gianger</hi> to the memory of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All the Commanders did the like; there were nothing but cries and lamentations; ſome threw themſelves upon his body, and embracing him wet him with their tears; others ſaid aloud, that they muſt revenge his death, teer out <hi>Rustan</hi>'s heart, remove <hi>Soliman</hi> from his Throne, go and burn <hi>Roxelana</hi> in her <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and declare <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s ſon Emperor, though he was but a child. Some again, leſs violent and ſeditious, threw down their arms, made a vow never to bear any, and having thereof framed as it were a Trophy, which they erected to the vertue of this Prince, they layd his body upon it, and abode round about it weeping the loſs they had ſuſtained. Never was there a more general conſternation ſeen; all the Soldiers continued four and twenty hours without eating: and if the prudence of <hi>Achmat</hi> had not ſhewed it ſelf in this occaſion, <hi>Soliman</hi>'s Throne had been overturned, and his perſon in danger. As for us, we heard indeed a great noiſe, but it was impoſſible for us to comprehend what it might be; and they whom <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had left to guard us were ſo faithful unto him, as they would not clear it unto us. We imagined with our ſelves, that peradventure Prince <hi>Gianger,</hi> having made one part of the Soldiers to riſe, endeavored to deliver <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> to the end he might come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and deliver us alſo; and in this eſtate we were between fear and hope. In the mean while <hi>Ruſtan</hi> was gone back to <hi>Soliman,</hi> who ſeeing him enter alone, demanded of him what <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſaid of his clemency. My Lord, anſwered he mightily ſurpriſed, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> is no longer in a condition ever to ſay any thing to thy Highneſs that may diſpleaſe thee. Ah! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate that I am, and moſt baſe as thou art, continued <hi>Soliman,</hi> how readily haſt thou obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in a wicked action? He asked him then whether he had not ſeen <hi>Achmat;</hi> and having underſtood that he arrived not till after the death of the Prince, he ſhewed ſuch exceſſive grief, as the like was never ſeen. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> amazed at ſo ſudden a change, would have repreſented unto him, how much this death aſſured the quiet of his Empire; but the <hi>Sultan,</hi> exceedingly moved with choller, chaſed him from his preſence, and forbad him for ever appearing before him again.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Soliman</hi> not knowing whom to make his moan to about his crime and his misfortune, commanded <hi>Achmat</hi> to be ſent for again to him. He was ſought for, and found with Prince <hi>Gianger,</hi> much buſied in moderating the violence of his grief, for he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the death of his brother. Theſe two Princes had always loved ſo dearly together, as never was there a more perfect and diſ-intereſted amity then theirs; ſo that it is eaſie to imagine the deſpair <hi>Gianger</hi> was in, when he knew not only that his brother was dead of a violent death; but that which touched his heart more nearly, that he dyed for his ſake, without being culpable of any thing, but of too much loving him.

Whereupon ſhe held her peace to wipe her eyes, and to give them leaſure alſo to do as much; and when her ſighs and theirs had had all the liberty could be required for them, and that a ſad and heavy ſilence had renewed their attention, ſhe proceeded in this ſort. <hi>Achmat</hi> having received the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s command for his repair to him, thought it was fit for him to obey: He left Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> then in the guard of five or ſix of his followers, with order carefully to obſerve him, and not to leave him out of their ſight. In going from his Tent to the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> he diſcerned the beginning of a Tumult amongſt the Soldiers, he heard not onely their lamentations and their cries, but alſo the propoſitions which they made, againſt <hi>Rustan,</hi> and even againſt the Emperor himſelf: So that being come to him, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60144:154"/> perceiving by his tears and diſcourſe his true repentance for his violences, he repreſented unto him, how it was requiſite for his ſafety, and for the good of the Empire, that he ſhould ſhew unto all his Soldiers the ſorrow he was in for the death of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> That he could not do it better, then in taking care to preſerve that which had been dear to him in his life-time; to which effect he was to give a place of retrent to <hi>Sarraida,</hi> have a good regard of <hi>Axiamina,</hi> and labor to appeaſe the grief of <hi>Gianger,</hi> who was come with them to the Camp, and whoſe affliction was ſo great, as it was capable of putting him into deſpair.</p>

He no ſooner heard it, but he beleeved it, and loſing the little reaſon he had reſting, he got out like a mad man, ſpight of them whom <hi>Achmat</hi> had left with him: and without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither he went, he found what he ſought for, that is to ſay, the body of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> which could not yet be drawn out of the Soldiers hands, who had layd it, as I have already told you, upon a great heap of their arms. As ſoon as <hi>Gianger</hi> approached to it, they made way for him to paſs through them; and redoubling their cries and lamentations, ſome of them offered him to revenge this death, and all of them together proteſted that they would have the ſame affection for him they had had for his brother. But he, without harkening to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, their offers, or their prayers, throws himſelf upon his brothers body, wets him with his tears, then looking round about him, as it were to ſeek for ſomething, he eſpyed a dagger amidſt that great number of arms, which he layd hold on; and then lifting up his voyce, with a more quiet countenance then before, Let ſome of you, O Soldiers (ſaid he) if the memory of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> be dear unto you, declare unto <hi>Soliman,</hi> that in giving my brother his death, he hath put this ſteel into my hand; and let the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> know alſo, that I did not dye till I had loſt the hope of poſſeſſing her: ſaying this, he ſtab'd the dagger into his heart, no body being able to prevent him, and fell down dead upon the body of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Alaſs! my Lord, I know this truth but too well; for by ill fortune, the charet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were paſſed ſo neer to that place, as I ſaw <hi>Gianger</hi> when as he ſtab'd himſelf. This ſight, and this action then made me give a great skriek. Is there (ſaid the Princeſs unto me, who did not look that way) ſome more new misfortune befallen us? Ah! Madam, ſaid I unto her, the greateſt that can happen to you in the eſtate wherein you are. We heard a redoubling then of the wailings, lamentations, and cries of the Soldiers, who making the name of <hi>Gianger</hi> to reſound all about, ſaid ſo much of his death, as they had acquainted her but too well what this misfortune was, without putting me to the trouble of telling it her. She commanded the charet, wherein we were, to ſtand ſtill; but the confuſion was ſo great, and the noiſe ſo dreadful, as her Order could not be heard; beſides, they that conducted us, took ſuch care to get us ſpeedily out of the Camp, as I beleeve if they had heard what ſhe ſaid, they would not have obeyed her; ſo that we went away in this manner, without more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly knowing the death of this miſerable Prince: having not learnt all that I have recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, and all that I ſhall tell you hereafter, till we came hither, where the generous <hi>Achmat</hi> imparted it unto us.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie, my Lord, to comprehend, what the grief of <hi>Axiamira</hi> was; That great and generous Soul, which never fainted under her own misfortunes, found it ſelf then too weak, to ſupport thoſe of another. For though love had no place in her heart, amity, compaſſion, and the obligations wherein ſhe ſtood engaged to Prince <hi>Gianger,</hi> produced the ſame effects in her upon this occaſion. What ſaid ſhe not to teſtifie her affliction! or to ſay better, what did ſhe not that ſhe might not ſurvive this laſt miſhap! ſhe abſolutely declined the care of her preſervation, ſhe refuſed to eat, and I dare ſay, ſhe would never have reſolved to live, if with my tears and prayers I had not conjured her not to leave me in the hands of a Prince, which might entreat me as one culpable. It was not becauſe I was poſſeſt with that fear; but ſeeing this Princeſs no way ſenſible of her own conſervation, I beleeved, that the ſame generoſity, which made her deſpiſe her life, to lament anothers misfortune, would induce her to preſerve it for the eaſing of mine. As indeed, after that ſhe ſuffered me to take a care of her, and without abandoning her grief, ſhe reſolved to attend death, and not to ſeek it.</p>
                  <p>We in this ſort arrived at this place where we are; and where afterwards we underſtood, that <hi>Gianger</hi> had no ſooner ſtabbed himſelf to the heart with a dagger, but the Soldiers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, anger, and fury redoubled far more. They which had thrown down their Arms took them up again, maugre the vow which they had made, and teſtified by their threats, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60144:155"/> they had ſtrange deſigns. It ſeemed to them that they had a ſecond time loſt <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Gianger,</hi> for the love of theſe two Princes was ſo generally known, as they regarded him as another himſelf. This tragique news was inſtantly carryed to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who received it with ſo much grief, as the abundance of tears which he ſhed in that occaſion hath almoſt defaced his crime; and if <hi>Achmat</hi> had not provided for his conſervation, he would peradventure have let the Soldiers gone on in their fury, without applying any remedy unto it. But whereas he was faithful unto him, and had no leſs prudence then affection, he counſelled him not to conceal his tears, to ſhew himſelf to the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to calm a ſtorm, which certainly had cauſed ſome ſtrange diſorder, if this wiſe ſervant had not diſſipated it. For the matter went ſo far, notwithſtanding <hi>Achmat</hi>'s providence, that the Soldiers who would revenge the death of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Gianger,</hi> ſeeing one part of their companions content themſelves with weeping, and not take up Arms againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign as they did, aſſaulted them with ſuch violence, as the others being conſtrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, there was ſo terrible a confuſion in this fight, that the two parties could not be diſtinguiſhed; and with an enraged fury they killed one another, not knowing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Already ſome of them were preparing to go to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Tent, when as he cauſed it to be publiſhed over all the Camp, that he deprived <hi>Rustan</hi> of all his Commands, and gave them to the generous <hi>Achmat.</hi> This Declaration ſuſpended the fury of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who notwithſtanding their deſpair and rage, ſoon quitted their Arms, to go and gather up the money which was thrown amongſt them; <hi>Achmat</hi> having cauſed this largeſs to be given them from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as it were for a recompence of the zeal they had ſhewed to the Princes. This preſent liberality made them forget that of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> and the very ſame Soldiers, who would have carryed fire even to the Emperors Tent, cryed, <hi>Long live the Sultan,</hi> a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour after, when as in perſon he made a turn about the Camp. He commanded the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the two Princes to be put into one Coffin, and the ſame being placed in a Charet covered with black velvet, he ordained them to be carried to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and laid in the ſame tomb, which he had prepar'd for himſelf neer to the Moſque he had built. He willed alſo that the ſaid Charet ſhould be attended upon by half of his Army, and that this funeral pomp ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with the ſame magnificence, as if it had been of an Emperor that had dyed in the Wars. As for himſelf, he had a purpoſe to have gone to <hi>Mecqua</hi> to expiate his fault, and to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and the holy Prophet for the Souls of the Princes: but the affairs of <hi>Perſia</hi> preſſing him, he contented himſelf with going to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where he gave ſo many teſtimonies of his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and grief, as it was eaſie to know, that this Prince had not acted by his own inclinations.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, whil'ſt <hi>Soliman</hi> gives marks of the ſorrow he is in for his violence, <hi>Roxelana</hi> repents her not of her wickedneſs, and far from having ſo good a motion, ſhe thinks of new cruelties. I have told you, if my memory fail not, how <hi>Ruſtan</hi> was chaſed from <hi>Solimans</hi> Tent, but I have not told you what became of him afterwards: You muſt underſtand then how ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving executed that which <hi>Roxelana</hi> had ſo ardently deſired, he thought it was not fit for him to expoſe himſelf inconſideratly, and that having nothing more to do there for the ſervice of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he might go and render her an account of his doings. He parted immediately then as ſecretly as poſſibly he could; but he ſtayd nevertheleſs at the firſt Town he came to, where one of his ſervants, whom he had given in charge about it, came and acquainted him with all that had been done in the Camp; I mean, the revolt of the Soldiers, the death of <hi>Gianger, Soliman</hi>'s extream repentance, the retreat which <hi>Sarraida</hi> had choſen, and briefly all that had paſt there. This cruel man, fully informed of all things, went with all ſpeed to <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and as he related it himſelf, as <hi>Achmat</hi> hath told us, although ſhe was acquainted both at one time with the death of <hi>Gianger,</hi> and that of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> yet the loſs of this laſt comforted her for that other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was her own ſon. There remained an unquietneſs yet in her minde, the blood of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had not fully ſatisfied her rage; ſhe would alſo have the life of his ſon, to the end the race of him might be utterly aboliſhed. So that to content this horrible deſire, ſhe told <hi>Rustan,</hi> that knowing the power ſhe had over the ſpirit of <hi>Soliman,</hi> he might beleeve that ſhe would appeaſe his anger, and that it would be eaſie for her to re-eſtabliſh him in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but he muſt firſt deal in ſuch ſort, as the race of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> might be quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the perſon of his ſon. <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who never found any thing difficult, when it concerned the committing of crimes, not onely promiſed it to her, but executed it.</p>

                     </hi> been two months at <hi>Pruſa,</hi> ſcarcely had ſhe had leaſure to dry up her firſt tears, when as the Traytor <hi>Ruſtan</hi> gave her a new cauſe of weeping. He went diſguiſed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60144:156"/> to the parts about <hi>Pruſa,</hi> and from thence ſent to <hi>Sarraida</hi> one of the miniſters of his fury, who was his Slave, and who made ſhew that he was come to this excellent Princeſs from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to aſſure her of the continuance of his good-will and protection. He alſo brought preſents to her ſon, as being gages of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s affection. He told her further, that his Highneſs would make <hi>Muſtapha</hi> revive in the perſon of this young Prince; and that he commanded her to have a great care of his health and education. This infortunate mother, who knew by the publique voyce how much <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeemed to repent him of his violence, ſuffered her ſelf to be perſwaded that all which this wicked man ſaid was true. In the mean time he thinks of executing his deſign any way whatſoever; and ſeeing it was hard for him to remove this young Prince from <hi>Sarraida,</hi> either to finde means to poyſon him, or to do any violence in a Town, where the memory of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was in ſo much veneration, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought him to perſwade <hi>Sarraida</hi> that ſhe would accuſtom her ſelf to take the ayr, for fear leſt keeping always in that ſort within doors, her melancholly ſhould paſs unto her ſon, and ſo prove prejudicial to his health. After he had gotten this Princeſs to yeeld unto that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, he propounded to her a thing, which, very much agreeing with her ſad and heavy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, ſeemed to be a very fit and pleaſing entertainment for her; which was to go and ſee the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Tombs, that were four or five miles diſtant from this Town, and whoſe ſtately Moſques are to this day very carefully maintained. Now, my Lord, that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Traytor to give <hi>Sarraida</hi> this counſel, was, that having ſuborned him, who was to drive her Charet, he had broken the axletree of it, not quite through, but in ſuch a manner, as he foreſaw how upon their arrival at a very difficult paſſage, which was juſt in the midſt of the way, that which he expected would aſſuredly come to paſs, as indeed the matter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded accordingly. In helping the Princeſs into her Charet, he perſwaded the young Prince to go with him on horſeback, who, according to the cuſtom of children, was raviſhed with this propoſition. <hi>Sarraida,</hi> out of a thought of tenderneſs, or it may be out of an inſtinct that advertiſed her of her misfortune, oppoſed it as much as ſhe could; but ſeeing her ſon afflicted at it, and that this man promiſed her to hold him in his arms, and to have a great care of him, ſhe conſented to it. She was no ſooner out of the Town, but this Traytor who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the young Prince, began to get before, and by little and little going farther from the Charet, as if he had not done it of purpoſe, <hi>Sarraida</hi> loſt the ſight of him.</p>
                  <p>This infortunate Princeſs ſeeing her ſon no longer, began to fear without knowing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereupon ſhe commanded her Charet-man to drive as faſt as he could, but whereas he was ſuborned, he obeyed not at firſt, howbeit ſhe threatened him in ſuch anger, as he was conſtrained to do what ſhe would have him; but this ſpeed was that which retarded her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the more; for the axletree (as I have told you) being half broken, and the Charet going violently on, it broke ſooner then otherwiſe it would have done. <hi>Sarraida,</hi> beholding it overturned, and no longer ſeeing her ſon, never conſulted on that which ſhe was to do; ſo that abandoning her Charet, and walking on foot, followed by two women that accompanied her, ſhe continued in the way which ſhe had taken, with a trembling of her heart, and an extream grief. And whereas ſhe was carryed by affection, ſhe went ſo faſt, as but one of her women could follow her. She arrived then neer to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Tombs, but alaſs! what was the object which ſhe encountred there? ſhe beheld her ſon ſtrangled, ſtill warm, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and almoſt in the laſt pangs of death. This deadly ſpectacle touched her in ſo ſtrange a manner, as ſhe fell down as it were dead upon the body of her ſon.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time he that had driven <hi>Sarraida</hi>'s Charet, being returned to the Town, and the remorſe of his crime making him to anſwer thoſe from the purpoſe which demanded of him where the Princeſs was, a great part of the Town, men and women, went themſelves to learn ſome news of her, ſo much was this vertuous Princeſs beloved in that place. They found her ſtill in a ſwoon, neither the woman that ſerved her, nor another that was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance, and had ſeen the death of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s ſon, having been able to bring her to her ſelf again. The care which they altogether took about her, got her to open her eyes, and ſo far to recover the uſe of reaſon, as to underſtand from the woman, which ſhe found there, with what conſtancy that young Prince had reſolved to dye. She recounted unto her, how going to <hi>Pruſa,</hi> and feeling her ſelf weary, ſhe had reſted her ſelf in one of the Niches of the Moſque, and that being fallen aſleep there, ſhe was wakened with a noiſe that an horſe made; that ſhe had ſeen a man holding this young child in his arms, who as ſoon as he was alighted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60144:156"/> had ſhewed him a Bow-ſtring, and had told him that he had a Command from the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> to put him to death; that upon this diſcourſe the child was no whit daunted, and ſaid, that it was not <hi>Soliman,</hi> but Heaven that would have it ſo, and that therefore there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more reſting for him but to obey, and yield his neck to him, as he had done with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous conſtancy; that for her part, ſhe had done what ſhe could to hinder ſo horrible a fact, but it was impoſſible for her; that as ſoon as the child was dead, his Executioner got to horſe, and fled away withall ſpeed; that afterwards ſhe could not find in her heart to abandon this poor infortunate child, for fear leſt ſome wilde beaſt ſhould devour him. <hi>Sarraida,</hi> having heard this woman, firſt lift up her eyes to Heaven, then caſting them down on the body of her ſon, ſhe ſuddenly cloſed them up, without ſhedding ſo much as a tear, grief ſuffocated her in ſuch ſort, as all that ſhe could ſay was, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> is dead, and his ſon is no longer living, let as follow them then willingly, ſince there is nothing left for us to loſe. After this ſhe never ſpake more, but dyed in the ſame place where her ſon had yielded up the ghoſt: ſo that they were both carried back to <hi>Pruſa,</hi> where this accident cauſed ſo general a mourning, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one ſo ſenſibly, as there was not any teſtimony of affection, or mark of honor, which they of this Town did not render to the Corps of <hi>Sarraida</hi> and her ſon, which of their own authority they layd in the Sepulchres of the ancient Emperors, a thing without example. The chiefeſt amongſt them went in all haſte to purſue the Murtherer of this young Prince, but he was already gotten far enough off with <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who no ſooner underſtood that his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was executed, but away he poſted to carry <hi>Roxelana</hi> the news of it, who received it with unſpeakable joy.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the <hi>Sultan</hi> was to arrive within two days, ſhe counſelled him to conceal himſelf, until ſhe had appeaſed his diſpleaſure. In the mean time ſhe willed him ſo to order the matter, as it might be believed, that the death of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s ſon came by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Soliman,</hi> for fear leſt he being ſuſpected for it, ſhould draw the peoples hatred upon him, who would eaſily be perſwaded of that which they were willing ſhould be. As indeed, the moſt part were of that opinion, though it were otherwiſe; for that Slave of <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ong ſince confeſſed it on his death bed. <hi>Soliman</hi> at his return underſtanding the death of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s ſon, teſtified a great deal of ſorrow and anger for it; but <hi>Roxelana</hi> accuſtomed to prevail over the ſpirit of this Prince, with her wiles and tears, told him, that this action it may be was not too much diſadvantageous to the quiet of his Empire, for ſhe had been informed, that <hi>Sarraida,</hi> ſince her being at <hi>Pruſa,</hi> had continually inſpired her ſon with thoughts of revenge; that all they of that Town, whenſoever he paſſed through the ſtreets, did nothing but wiſh him a longer life then his father, to the end he might revenge his death, and mount up to a Throne which appertained unto him; that without doubt ſome man zealous for his Highneſs had undertaken this bold action; and therefore according to her ſence the Author of it was not to be much looked after. This diſcourſe, which ſhould have begot a ſuſpicion in the mind of <hi>Soliman,</hi> perſwaded him, and was ſo prevalent with him, as there was no further enquiry made of this crime, which confirmed the people in the opinion, that it had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Order. After this, <hi>Roxelana</hi> did her uttermoſt endeavor to obtain <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s grace, but ſhe could not poſſibly do it. In the mean time the vertuous <hi>Achmat,</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood more particularly the extream affection, which Prince <hi>Mustapha</hi> and Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> had born to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> to ſhew how dear their memory was unto him, had obtained the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſee her, which he hath done as often as his occaſions would ſuffer him. And it is by him alſo that we have underſtood, how <hi>Soliman</hi> would not ſince his return let any body ſpeak to him of buſineſs, being in ſo deep a melancholy, as <hi>Roxelana</hi> her ſelf with all her artifices could not divert him from it.</p>
                  <p>Behold, my Lord, what hath been the fortune of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Gianger,</hi> what is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and that which ſhe hath commanded me to tell you.

It is certain, Madam, anſwered <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that it is hard to cure them throughly, but not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to eaſe them. And then he aſſured her, that if he had not loſt his credit with <hi>Soliman,</hi> he would obtain one thing of that great Prince, which according to his judgment would cauſe her to lead a more pleaſing life, till Fortune, weary of perſecuting her, would permit her to return into <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Princeſs, not able to believe a thing wherein ſhe ſaw ſo little likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, requeſted him to tell her by what means he hoped to do that which he ſaid: but our illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa</hi> being loth to acquaint her with his deſign till he was able to execute it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her to diſpence with him for it, and to give him only two days to make good his word unto her. That in the mean time ſhe would live aſſured, that whatſoever he had hitherto done at the only intreaty of <hi>

                  <p>After this diſcourſe they parted, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> leaving <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and himſelf charged with extream grief, to ſee that this Prince, whom he ſo dearly loved, had been ſo weak, as to ſuffer himſelf to be carryed to the greateſt cruelty that can be exerciſed, he who out of his own inclination was one of the beſt Princes of the world. This thought begetting another, the image of others misfortunes ſo lively repreſented unto him his own, that he returned to his Palace with ſo much heavineſs, as if ſome new occaſion of afflicting himſelf had arrived unto him, though, to ſpeak rightly of things, he was capable of no ſorrow after that, which he had endured in abſenting himſelf from <hi>Iſabella.</hi>

               <p>THe next day <hi>Ibrahim</hi> went to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and with a dextrous diſcourſe he gave him to underſtand, that he had learned what he durſt not tell him.

               <p>After all theſe reaſons, <hi>Soliman</hi> anſwered him, that they were needleſs, ſince his entreaty alone ſufficed to make him conſent to all that he could deſire; there being but one onely thing which he could never obtain of him. The <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> not daring to be curious in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, for fear of receiving ſome diſtaſte by it, contented himſelf with giving <hi>Soliman</hi> thanks, and omitting no time, he went and gave order to have a ſtately equipage provided for <hi>Axiamira.</hi> And whereas he was exact in all things, he uſed ſuch diligence, as the day after all was in the ſtate which he deſired it to be. He went the next morning to the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers, where in few words he propounded to the Princeſs her going to <hi>Biti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſa,</hi> whereof <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was Governor, and where ſhe ſhould have no ſtraiter a priſon then the walls of the Town, nor other guard then his and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s faith. He told her moreover, how in that place ſhe ſhould finde every one diſpoſed to ſerve her, and to render her all kinde
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60144:157"/> of obedience, by the order which he would give for it; that means ſhould be ſetled on her to maintain her like a perſon of her quality; that there ſhe would be far enough from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> for ever being in fear of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and neer enough to her Country, to keep cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> her brother, and to procure it may be a general peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two great Empires. That for his part, he promiſed her, to be always moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of her intereſts, and not to ſuffer any propoſitions to be accepted, which the <hi>Sophi</hi> might happen to make for the drawing her out of <hi>Soliman</hi>'s hands, unleſs they were ſuch, as ſhe needed not be longer afraid of the violences of <hi>Deliment.</hi>

                  <hi>Axiamira,</hi> raviſhed with the generoſity and prudence of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> rendred him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thanks, and requeſted him to furniſh her with ſome means, that ſhe might not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ingrateful. You may, Madam, anſwered he, not only pay me for the ſervices which I intend to do you, but alſo make me beholding to you all the days of my life, provided you will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſelf to be perſwaded, that his Highneſs had never any intention to have the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> be carryed away by force; that he hath not been violent towards <hi>Mustapha</hi> his ſon, but at the inſtigation of others; that the onely defect of this Prince is onely a facility, whereof love and his gentle nature are the cauſes: and that <hi>in fine,</hi> he hath ſo many rare qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as he is not unworthy the eſteem of the incomparable <hi>Axiamira.</hi> The affection wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And though he be in ſome ſort the cauſe of the greateſt part of my miſeries, yet I promiſe you, O generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to give credit rather to your words, then to mine own experience; and never to ſpeak of this Prince, but as you ſpeak of him your ſelf. I will complain of Fortune, without murmuring againſt <hi>Soliman;</hi> and albeit I am reſolved to weep all my life-time for the loſs of thoſe two illuſtrious children of his, yet will I not accuſe any for it but the cruel <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and the perfidious <hi>Rustan.</hi> This converſation laſted yet a good while longer, and was ſpent in civility on either part. <hi>Felixana</hi> in her particular gave <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> a world of thanks, and aſſured him ſhe would render <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> an exact account of that which he had done for her, to the end he might help to acknowledg it in publiſhing it, ſince they could never acquite themſelves of it other-ways. Preſently thereupon, the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> took his leave of the Princeſs, and told her, that ſhe might depart the next morning, if her health would permit her: As indeed all her equipage was ready accordingly, but with ſuch magnificence, as if ſhe had been in <hi>Perſia.</hi> This excellent Princeſs had made her ſelf to be ſo beloved of them that guarded her, as they could not ſee her part without abundance of tears, though they very much rejoyced for all that to know, that her priſon ſhould not be thence forward ſo ſtrait. But amongſt the reſt, <hi>Halima</hi> was ſo afflicted at it, as ſhe was not to be comforted; ſhe gave her two Slaves, who had always waited upon her during her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; and <hi>Axiamira,</hi> in recompence thereof, gave her a chain of Diamonds, which ſhe had ſtill kept in all her misfortunes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had ſent away <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Slave, whom he had brought away from the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers the day before, to advertiſe his Maſter to repair to <hi>Biti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſa,</hi> if his ſtrength would permit him, there to receive the Princeſs. But in caſe he ſhould no be able ſo to do, he diſpatched away another man, with a command from the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to all the Governors of thoſe Towns, which were upon the road, whereby ſhe was to paſs, to render her as much honor, as if ſhe had been the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen. And the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> to omit nothing that might be for the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s ſafety, had alſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five thouſand <hi>Janizaries</hi> to be her convoy, whom ſhe found ready attending for her a days march from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This Princeſſes journey had as proſperous a ſucceſs, as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had wiſhed it ſhould. She was received with a great deal of magnificence at all the places where ſhe paſſed, and without having any other commodity then that, which the wearineſs of ſo long a way might occaſion, ſhe arrived at <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> whither <hi>

               <p>But whil'ſt <hi>Ibrahim</hi> aſſwages other folks ſorrows, his love renders him every day more unhappy. The more he ſees <hi>Soliman,</hi> the leſs appearance he ſees of obtaining his liberty, which he had reſolved to demand of him at his departure from <hi>Monaco.</hi> This Prince ceaſed not dayly telling him, that he had been dead if he had not returned; that he was the ſoul of his Empire; that he could not ſubſiſt without him; that ſix months abſence of his had been the cauſe of more misfortune to him, then he had had in all his life beſides; and that <hi>in fine</hi> not being able to live without him, he muſt reſolve to dye with him. To all theſe particulars the illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa</hi> made no other anſwer then with low ſubmiſſions, but by his ſighs and ſilence he teſtified ſufficiently to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that he expreſſed not all his thought; and that the ſight of his Miſtreſs had rather augmented his love, then diminiſhed his unquietneſs. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whereas the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was deſirous to avoyd all occaſions that might conſtrain him to refuſe <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he made as though he did not perceive his ſadneſs, but endevored to gain him abſolutely, and divert him from his melancholy, by all the honors, by all the liberalities, and all the careſſes, that a great Prince can confer on a great Miniſter. But the more the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaw himſelf obliged, the more affliction he had: He received the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s preſents, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new chains, which tyed him unto him; his favors were torments unto him; and though in his heart he loved this Prince dearly, yet would he not have been loved of him, ſo certain it is that love is ſtronger then amity.</p>
               <p>In this deplorable eſtate lived <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with an extream conſtraint; he delt no longer in affairs as he was wont; he declined the world as much as he could; yea the very ſight of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> became inſupportable to him; and not daring to deſire of him the power to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> out of the opinion he had that he ſhould be denyed, he ſought no longer for any thing but onely ſolitude. It was not becauſe his grief was the leſs ſenſible to him by it, but it was becauſe he knew, that the liberty to bewail ones ſelf is ſome kinde of conſolation to an afflicted perſon. At length, after he had well conſulted with himſelf, he reſolved to ſpeak plainly to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> with an intent if he were refuſed (as he almoſt made no doubt but he ſhould) to abandon himſelf in ſuch ſort to grief, as death would be conſtrained to ſuccor him; but he knew not, when he took this reſolution, that he could not execute it: for as often as he went to the <hi>Serraglio</hi> for that purpoſe, <hi>Soliman</hi> with ſo much addreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded all manner of diſcourſe that might carry the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to ſpeak to him of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and always took ſuch care to let him know the neceſſity he had of his preſence, as the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> no longer doubting, but that <hi>Soliman</hi> would deny him if he demanded his liberty of him, undertook not to augment his diſpleaſure yet further, by the certainty of an evil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was already but too well aſſured. He remained then without ſpeaking, and ſhutting up his thoughts in his heart, he grew to be the melancholickeſt man in the world. He aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the care of affairs, and making to himſelf a priſon of his Palace, he went no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but now and then to go to the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and that too very ſeldom. His preſence, which was wont to charm all <hi>Soliman's</hi> unquietneſſes, now begot nothing but grief in him; for he ſaw him ſo altered, his eyes ſo ſunk into his head, his face ſo pale, his humor ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After ſo right and ſo well-grounded a debate, they told the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> freely, that they could not warrant <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life; that they were Phyſicians for the diſeaſes of the body, and not for that of the minde; that in the eſtate wherein the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was, he was to be his own Phyſician himſelf; though, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their opinion, he was in terms, rather of being the cauſe of his death, then of his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60144:158"/> health; that for their parts, all they could do with their remedies was to fortifie Nature as much as they could; but at length ſo long and ſo violent a melancholy would make an end of him, and ſo much the rather for that the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to be rid of them, ſaid, that he was not ſick, and conſequently had no need of remedies.</p>

For not ſeeing any reaſon that he had to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but for the abſence of the perſon whom he loved, he was aſſured that love was the cauſe of his heavineſs. In this opinion he diſmiſſed his Phyſicians; howbeit he was no ſooner alone, but accuſing himſelf for the loſs of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he was almoſt reſolved to go and ask of him what he would have, (without conſidering how in this occaſion, he deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the onely conſolation he had, and of the onely perſon he could love) when as the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> Queen entred into his chamber, according to the priviledg which ſhe had for it. As ſoon as ſhe looked on him, ſhe knew that he was ſomewhat troubled in his mind; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhe was not able to diſcern, whether it were an effect of choller, or of affliction, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all her addreſs to be cleared therein. <hi>Soliman</hi> had no longer that violent love for her, which had ſo often blinded him, yet had ſhe ſtill that Empire over him, as he could never refuſe her any thing, but the grace of <hi>Rustan;</hi> ſo that in this occaſion he almoſt ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be vanquiſhed by her.

When he was in her chamber, ſhe told him, that whatſoever ſhe could do, it was impoſſible for her to obtain his grace; and that ſhe thought he would never obtain it, but by ſome very extraordinary way; that there was one did then preſent it ſelf, which ſhe would propoſe unto him, to the end that if he ſaw any likelyhood in it, ſhe would finiſh that which ſhe had begun; and then ſhe recounted unto him what <hi>Soliman</hi> had ſaid to her, and what ſhe had anſwered. But it appeared that <hi>Rustan</hi> was better informed of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s fortune, them ſhe imagined; for this man, who thought of nothing but his re-eſtabliſhment, had ſuborned one of the <hi>Grand Viſiers</hi> ſervants, to endevor to finde out, whether this illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa</hi> were the cauſe that he was not reſtored.

We muſt then, continued ſhe, ſave <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life at this time to obtain your re-eſtabliſhment; and then we will proceed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner afterwards, if it be offenſive to us. <hi>Roxelana</hi> then propounded unto him the demanding of an Army of <hi>Soliman</hi> to bring away this Princeſs by force, whoſe abſence cauſed <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s ſuffering: but <hi>Rustan</hi> replyed, that as long as one could work by addreſs, no recourſe was to be had to force; that for him, he knew better how to beguile, then to fight; and in the end, without explaining his deſign unto her, he promiſed her to periſh, or to bring this Princeſs to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> provided he might be furniſhed with a man of war, throughly provided; and might be permitted to ſay, in the places where he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, that he was going to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the quality of a <hi>Chaoux,</hi> from the <hi>Grand Signior.

At firſt <hi>Rustan</hi> craved pardon of him, but when as <hi>Soliman</hi> preſſed him to tell him, which way he hoped to make his deſign ſucceed, wherewith <hi>Roxelana</hi> had already acquainted him. My Lord, anſwered he, I do not think it a harder matter to carry away a Princeſs of <hi>Italy</hi> by force, then a Princeſs of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> wherefore let thy Highneſs be aſſured, that if that be given me, which the <hi>Sultana</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt hath demanded of thee for me, and that thou wilt make me hope I may re-enter into thy favor, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſhall quickly be the happieſt man on the Earth; for wanting nothing to make him ſo, but the poſſeſſion of this Princeſs, I will bring her to him ere it be long, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſave death alone being able to keep me from performing it. <hi>Soliman</hi> had at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome averſion to this violence, but coming to conſider, that it was the onely way to retain <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with him, he forgot all other conſiderations. So that before he diſmiſſed <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> he was abſolutely reſolved to attempt the matter, and therefore he aſſured him that he ſhould depart within two days: but in the mean time he charged him to entreat the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Monaco,</hi> who was ſhe that he was to bring away, with the ſame reſpect as he was obliged to have for the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen.</p>
               <p>Things being in theſe terms, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> cauſed all <hi>Rustan</hi>'s equipage to be made ready, with all the diligence that poſſibly could be; he furniſhed him likewiſe with great ſtore of mony and jewels, in caſe he ſhould have need of it; he had alſo his diſpatch, as if indeed he had been ſent to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the quality of a <hi>Chaoux:</hi> and lacking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe for his voyage, he ſet ſail in as favorable a ſeaſon as might be. This happy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Navigation gave no falſe hopes to the Pilot, who made ſuch uſe of the advantage of the wind and fair weather, as, his veſſel being an excellent ſailer, he made this cut with a ſpeed, the like whereof hath not been heard ſpeak of in all the ſeas of the Levant. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Monaco,</hi> ſent his skiff with one of his ſervants, and an interpreter, to demand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Princeſs for his entrance into the Port, there to mend his veſſel, which he ſaid was bruiſed with the fury of the Sea, and he had cauſed one maſt and ſome of the tackle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be really broken, to the end, if what he deſired were not granted, he might have a pretext to ſtay in that place, and ſo might be able to ſeek out ſome means for the executing of his deſign. But it happened that the Princeſs, having been conſtrained to go to <hi>Genoua</hi> for ſome important reaſons, which had obliged her thereunto, was not then at <hi>Monaco:</hi> ſo that he, who commanded in her abſence, anſwered <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s meſſenger, that the Princeſs at her departure had given him order, to let no man of war enter into the Port, as long as ſhe was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rustan</hi> underſtanding by the return of his skiff that this Princeſs was not at <hi>Monaco,</hi> ſeemed at firſt to be much afflicted at it; but ſuddenly being of another minde, he thought on the contrary that it would be advantageous to him, ſince ſhe being queſtionleſs to return from <hi>Genoua</hi> to <hi>Monaco,</hi> it would be eaſier for him to carry her away at ſea, then out of a Town. He reſolved then to go to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and ſhew the <hi>State</hi> his diſpatch, to the end he might be the better received by them, and might make his abode there till the Princeſs ſhould depart from thence to <hi>Monaco,</hi> under colour that he waited for one of his ſhips, which he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60144:159"/> would ſay was ſevered from him by a Tempeſt. The matter being thus reſolved, he executed it accordingly; and taking into the main Sea again, to the end he might be ſeen to come from the Levant, he ſailed to <hi>Genoua,</hi> where he was received, not only as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Chaoux,</hi> as ſoon as he had ſhewed his diſpatch, but as one ſent from a Prince, to whom the Republique had a great obligation. In the mean time he dextrouſly enquired after the place where the Princeſs of <hi>Monaco</hi>'s Palace was; and having learnt it out, he made one of his Slaves watch always in the ſame ſtreet to diſcover, whether any preparations were a making thereabout for a Voyage. He cauſed ſome to obſerve at the Port, whether any Galley were ready to ſet forth, and all to be informed when ſhe went; In concluſion, he omitted nothing that might ſerve for his deſign. He was certain days in this expectation with a great deal of impatience; but Fortune, that would not yet abandon him, furniſhed him with a far more favorable occaſion to carry away the Princeſs, then that which he attended.</p>
               <p>One night, when as he was in his Veſſel, which notwithſtanding the intreaties of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate he would never abandon, after he had heard a dreadful noiſe of armed men, both at the Port, and in the City, he was advertiſed by thoſe whom he had ſent thither, that all was in confuſion there; that the gates were all open; that the Port was no longer cloſed; and that in this diſorder, it could not be comprehended who were the enemies. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> making profit of this occaſion, and others misfortunes, leaves one part of his Souldiers in his V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs fearing he might be miſtaken, he cauſed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi> whom he ſaw to be more richly apparelled then the reſt, to be likewiſe carried away; for although it was night, yet had all the women of <hi>Genoua</hi> their clothes on, being riſen out of their beds upon the fearful noiſe they had heard in the City. And then again it was eaſie for them to carry away <hi>Emilia,</hi> who ſeeing the Princeſs born away, did only cry out in the ſtreets as they went along to oblige ſome to ſuccor them: As indeed there were thoſe, who knowing her voyce would have withſtood this rape, but it was in vain; for <hi>Rustan</hi> making uſe both of the valor of his men, of the diſorder of the City, and of the darkneſs of the night, cauſed theſe two fair afflicted ones to enter into his Veſſel, which had been made ready whil'ſt he was gone to this Execution; and from thence into <hi>Doria</hi>'s Galley, whereof the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slaves had rendered themſelves Maſters: ſo that he was no ſooner aboard it, but cauſing them preſently to weigh Anchor, he made out of the Port, and ſhaped his courſe for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſtill languiſhed, and his grief made him lead ſo ſad and weariſom a life, as the thought of death was the moſt pleaſing to him of any other. <hi>Soliman,</hi> for his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The hope of <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s return did many times diminiſh his diſpleaſure, but the incertainty thereof permitted him not to be long without unquietneſs; which augmented much more, when as the Term, which he had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in his mind for the execution of this enterpriſe, was arrived. He beleeved that <hi>Ruſtan</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d ſuffered Shipwrack; or that his deſign had been diſcovered; or that he had been killed; or at leaſtwiſe retained a Priſoner. He ſaw that the <hi>grand Viſiers</hi> grief abated not; and that the remedy would arrive too late, if the ſuccoring of him was never ſo little retarded. He had oftentimes a deſire to diſcover <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s Voyage unto him; but the fear of aggravating his d ſpleaſure, in ſtead of moderating it, ſtraightway reſtrained him from it. He knew very w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> could not chuſe but rejoyce at the ſight of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but he with reaſon feared, that he would be infinitely afflicted to know that violence ſhould be offered to the perſon he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60144:160"/> ſo loved; and that ſhe ſhould be expoſed to all the dangers of the Sea. So as all that <hi>Soliman</hi> could do was to bewail him, and to go and ſee him ſometimes againſt the cuſtom of the <hi>Grand Signiors,</hi> who ſeldom viſit their ſubjects. Theſe viſits gave no great ſatisfaction, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him that received them, or to him that rendred them. <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s melancholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled by ſeeing that which <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhewed in his countenance; and <hi>Soliman</hi>'s grew the greater by obſerving in his <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s face all the ſigns of an extream grief: Yet would he for all that conſtrain himſelf ſometimes; he thanked <hi>Soliman</hi> for his goodneſs to him; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him, that if he could loſe his life in ſerving him, he ſhould dye with ſome conſolation. <hi>Soliman,</hi> feeling himſelf pierced with grief by ſo kinde a diſcourſe, could not endure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, but was conſtrained to quit him, after he had conjured him to live for his ſake.</p>
               <p>The unquietneſs and fear which <hi>Soliman</hi> was in of loſing the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> took him up in ſuch ſort, as though the affairs of <hi>Perſia</hi> were extream preſſing, yet could he not reſolve to frame any deſign, contenting him onely with giving <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> order to oppoſe the Enemy as much as he could, if he attempted any thing; but not to enterprize ought againſt him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had a new order from him. This commandment no whit diſpleaſed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama;</hi> for albeit he was one of the valianteſt men of his age, yet was he very glad that the War did not keep him from abiding ſome time with <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana.</hi> The Enemy himſelf contributed alſo to his deſign; for though he had gotten the advantage in the laſt occaſions, yet was he a long time without undertaking any thing. That which cauſed this ſuſpenſion of Arms was the news, which was brought to the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Court, how <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> were in the hands of <hi>Soliman,</hi> who retained them priſoners. This laſt circumſtance exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Deliment:</hi> they did not wonder, to know certainly that they were not dead, as all the world had beleeved them to be; not to underſtand that they were in <hi>Turkis,</hi> becauſe they aforetime ſuſpected that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> had carryed them away; but to ſee him Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Army in <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s abſence, and to hear at the ſame inſtant that his Miſtreſs was a Priſoner, was a matter which they could not comprehend. They reſolved nevertheleſs to endevor to be cleared therein, by the means of thoſe ſecret intelligences, which all great Princes have in their neighbors Courts; and in the mean time to make great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for war, that they might ſerve their turns of them according to occaſion. <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who was acquainted with this news better then they, teſtified a great deal of joy for it; It was not becauſe he was not ſorry to know that <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> were in priſon, but having beleeved them to be dead, or in the power of <hi>Tachmas</hi> and <hi>Deliment,</hi> he was raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to underſtand that they were living, and out of their tyranny; not being able to imagine that two perſons of that importance could be ill entreated in a place, where <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was ſo powerful. <hi>Mahamed</hi> was not he alone, who was glad to know that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was not dead, for this Princeſs was ſo generally beloved throughout that Empire, as this news being ſpred amongſt the people, every one gave ſuch marks of an unſpeakable rejoycing, as if a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable victory had been obtained over the Enemy. All the women of quality of the City of <hi>Sultania,</hi> where <hi>Tachmas</hi> was reſident, when as he received this advice, ſent humbly to beſeech him, if there needed a ranſom for the redemption of the Princeſs, that he would be pleaſed to let all their jewels ſerve for a part of it; eſteeming themſelves more then happy, if with the loſs of their liberty they could buy out the Princeſſes. This generous mark of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they bore to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> was not received as it deſerved: for the ſubtle <hi>Perca,</hi> who was mad to ſee that her ſiſter left not to reign in <hi>Perſia,</hi> though ſhe was a priſoner at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> perſwaded <hi>Tachmas,</hi> that this extream affection, which the people carryed to the Princeſs, might cauſe great miſchiefs in the continuance of the war; that the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Axiamira</hi> was without doubt an artifice to deceive him; that it was without all likelyhood that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſhould be in good terms with <hi>Soliman,</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> be ill entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that there was ſomewhat in it, which was not apprehended; that it was to be feared, leſt whil'ſt <hi>Axiamira</hi> ſeemed to be in priſon, ſhe had not ſome intelligences in the Country; that if it were ſo, and that ſome one ſhould be ſo daring as to riſe, the name of <hi>Axiamira</hi> might quickly draw the people to her party; and that finally it was fit to let them know in good time, that this rejoycing was criminal; yea and that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was to be declared guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of high treaſon, for withdrawing her ſelf out of his dominions. She added further to this, that to extinguiſh the ardent love which the people bare the Princeſs, ſhe was to be taken by her own intereſt, in publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60144:160"/> the cauſe of the ruine of the whole Empire; that ſhe alone had made <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> revolt; and that ſhe alone had drawn <hi>Soliman</hi> to take up Arms: ſo that there needed no ranſom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem her, but a puiſſant Army to pluck her out of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s hands, and make an example of her to poſterity. <hi>Tachmas,</hi> having heard <hi>Perca</hi>'s diſcourſe, told her, that he ſaw a great deal of probability in that which ſhe ſaid; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd that he was reſolved to deal after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but that ſhould not keep him from doing what he could to draw home <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana,</hi> by the means of an Embaſſador; that it was for the dignity of the Empire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in that ſort; and for a wiſe Politician always to lay the blame on the Enemy. <hi>Deliment</hi> being arrived at the end of this converſation, confirmed <hi>Tachmas</hi> yet more in his deſign; having been advertiſed by a Governor of one of the frontire Towns, that <hi>Axiamira</hi> was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onger a priſoner at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> that ſhe had been conducted to <hi>Bitiliſa</hi> with a moſt magnificent Train; and that ſhe had been received there by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> with all the marks of honor that could have been rendred her in <hi>Perſia.</hi> This laſt news touched the <hi>Sophi</hi> ſenſibly; when he had underſtood that <hi>Felixana</hi> was a priſoner, he had at leaſt had the conſolation to hope that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſhould not ſee her no more then he; but hearing that ſhe was in a Town, whereof he was Governor, jealouſie tranſported him in ſuch ſort, as he ſcarcely knew what he ſaid. For <hi>Deliment,</hi> whereas he could not be jealous, the deſpight to ſee himſelf contemned, and the rage he was in for that he could not poſſeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> excited as much trouble in his ſoul, as jealouſie did in the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>As for the ambitious <hi>Perca,</hi> the onely deſire that ſhe had to reign made her to move; and that ſhe might riſe to that ſupream greatneſs, ſhe thought there was but two things wanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o her; the death of <hi>Deliment,</hi> and the peoples hatred to <hi>Axiamira.</hi> For touching <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Mahamed,</hi> ſhe did not beleeve that the ſtupidity of the one, and the blindneſs of the other, would permit them to oppoſe her. So that to execute her intention, ſhe perſwaded <hi>Deliment,</hi> that he was at this time to hazard all things; that it was not for his honor, to know <hi>Axiamira</hi> was ſo neer the frontire, and not do his uttermoſt to draw her out of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s hands: And for <hi>Tachmas,</hi> ſhe made him do that which by her counſel he had reſolved upon. He ſaid before all his Court, that he took it very ill, ſuch joy ſhould be teſtified upon notice had that his daughter was in the power of his Enemy; that the belief of her death had touched him leſs, then the news he had received that ſhe lived in that manner; and then he publiquely declared her guilty of high Treaſon, aggravating all that <hi>Perca</hi> had ſaid to him. But though this Manifeſt had ſome appearance of truth, yet found it no credit, either with the <hi>Grandees,</hi> or the people. The violences of <hi>Deliment,</hi> the wickedneſs of <hi>Perca,</hi> and the vertue of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> were too well known to have the matter ſucceed, as <hi>Tachmas</hi> hoped it would. And the people, on the contrary, ſeeing ſo great marks of animoſity in a father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his daughter, in a ſiſter againſt her ſiſter, were ready to rebel, and be carryed to ſome ſtrange reſolution.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Deliment</hi> thinks of levying of Troops, and making up ſo mighty an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as, vanquiſher or vanquiſhed, it ſhould abſolutely decide the fortune of this war; being reſolved to dye, or to return with <hi>Axiamira. Tachmas</hi> on his ſide, following his reſolution, diſpatches an Embaſſador to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to demand his daughter, and <hi>Felixana</hi> of him; offering two millions for their ranſom, though by law he beleeved not himſelf obliged to give any thing for two perſons, that were not priſoners of war. He ſent away divers ſpies at the ſame inſtant to <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> to learn what paſt there; but all of them reported, that the Princeſs and <hi>Felixana</hi> ſeemed to be abſolutely at liberty; that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> rendred them all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable civilities; and what care ſoever they took therein, they could not diſcover for what reaſon the Princeſs had been conducted to <hi>Bitiliſa;</hi> the people ſaying no other thing, but that it was beleeved ſhe was come neer unto <hi>Perſia</hi> to make propoſitions of Peace. A few days after, a Meſſenger ſent by <hi>Axiamira</hi> came and brought him a Letter from this Princeſs, who not doubting but that the <hi>Sophi</hi> had heard where ſhe was, thought it was fit for her to write unto him, to the end ſhe might not be wanting in that duty which ſhe owed him, as being her father. When he received this Letter, <hi>Perca</hi> and <hi>Deliment</hi> were there preſent, who would have obliged him not to have read it, for fear leſt he ſhould have been moved therewith, but they could not prevail with him; for this Prince, provoked more by curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the thought that he ſhould finde ſomething in it which regarded <hi>Felixana,</hi> then by any kindneſs, opened it, and reading it aloud, he ſaw that was thus.</p>

               <p>The reading of this Letter touched the <hi>Sophi</hi> in a diverſe manner; he felt tenderneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and anger; and it may be if he had been alone, Nature and Reaſon had prevailed ſo powerfully for <hi>Axiamira,</hi> as ſhe had carried away the victory from her enemies; but the counſels of <hi>Perca,</hi> and the ſpeeches of <hi>Deliment,</hi> wrought a clean contrary effect in him. <hi>Perca</hi> told him, that it was too daring a part in her to be ſo bold, as to write ſuch things to him of a man whom he loved; that without doubt <hi>Axiamira</hi> ſpake not thus, but becauſe ſhe was well aſſured, that whatſoever ranſom was offered, ſhe ſhould never be remitted into his power; that he was to teſtifie a great deal of reſentment for this inſolent proceeding, and to intreat him ill whom the Princeſs had ſent, who queſtionleſs was come to Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> or as a Spy, rather then to bring him this Letter, which could not ſerve <hi>Axiamira</hi> for ought, whether ſhe remained in the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Dominions, or whether ſhe returned into his Empire. <hi>Deliment</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Sophi</hi> ſufficiently incenſed, took a different way from that which <hi>Perca</hi> had held, which yet produced the ſame effect. He beſought the <hi>Sophi,</hi> with a falſe generoſity, to permit him to withdraw himſelf from affairs, and from about him, for the contenting of <hi>Axiamira.</hi> But the <hi>Sophi,</hi> as <hi>Deliment</hi> had rightly forecaſt it, forbad him the further proſecuting of this diſcourſe, his anger redoubling ſo much the more by this artifice. And for a concluſion, he called the party before him, who had brought him the Letter from <hi>Axiamira,</hi> charged him never to come within his Dominions again, and told him, that if he had not pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Then he willed him to ſay unto her that had ſent him (for he would not call her the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, his Daughter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>After this cruel anſwer, the <hi>Sophi</hi> commanded this man to be ſearched, to ſee whether he had any Letters about him for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> or his Governor: this ſearch was not vain; they found one for the Prince, wherein what care ſoever <hi>Axiamira</hi> had taken that it ſhould not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60144:161"/> prejudice him if it were met withall, yet had ſhe not ſufficiently concealed the extream affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was between them, and the intelligence they had held together, when ſhe was at <hi>Amaſia.</hi> So that as ſoon as it was read, it was reſolved, for fear <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſhould receive others by ſome more ſecret way, to have two things done. The firſt, to change all his Houſe, to the end that having none that he could truſt about him, he might not receive any news from <hi>Axiamira.</hi> And the ſecond, to ſecure his perſon, leſt ſome abroad ſhould attempt that which was doubted from them. This deſign being reſolved, was quickly executed. <hi>Deliment,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wonted inſolency, went himſelf to command the blind Prince from the <hi>Sophi</hi> not to ſtir out of his lodging, and to charge both his Governor and all his ſervants to be gone from him: That done, he placed a Guard about him, and left this Prince in an affliction, the like whereof he had never felt before. All that came near him were his Enemies Agents, and whether he would or no he was enforced to let them wait upon him. This detention made a great noiſe in the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Court, even the people themſelves were divers times about to riſe; but amongſt the reſt the Princes domeſtick ſervants could not endure this violence. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Mahamed</hi>'s Governor, having aſſembled the chiefeſt of them together, propounded unto them the enterpriſing of carrying away the Prince their Maſter to <hi>Bitiliſa.</hi> He told them, that it was better to put him into the hands of a courteous enemy, as <hi>Soliman</hi> was to <hi>Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> then to leave him in the power of a cruel and incenſed father; that as for them, if they continued at <hi>Sultania,</hi> they would not be in ſafety, but upon the leaſt ſuſpicion that one ſhould have of them they would be ſeverely puniſhed; ſo that as well for the conſervation of the Prince, as for their own, they were to undertake the delivery of him. They all anſwered him with a great deal of zeal and affection, that they were ready to expoſe their lives for the Prince their Maſter; but that they did not think they could commodiouſly do it for him. Whereupon this wiſe Governor told them, how he knew certainly that thoſe which guarded him, relying on his blindneſs, were not very exact in keeping him; that it being ſo, the matter would not be very difficult, becauſe the Prince lay in a low chamber, that jetted upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace garden, whereof the walls were not very high; that the only difficulty was to advertiſe him not to make any noiſe, at ſuch time as he ſhould hear his chamber window opened; which indeed would not be very eaſie to do, by reaſon the Prince could neither read that which ſhould be written to him, nor ſee the ſigns that might be made him, ſo that he concluded ſomething was to be left to chance; that for ſo much as concerned their getting out of the City, the Governor thereof was reſolved to follow the fortune of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and to abandon a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which he knew well would be taken from him in a ſhort time, by reaſon of the great affection he had teſtified to this Princeſs, and that ſo it would be eaſie for them to eſcape. This Propoſition being approved of by all, they thought of nothing elſe but of executing it. And whereas the nights were very dark, in regard the Moon did not ſhine, they deferred it no further.</p>
               <p>The Governor of <hi>Sultania,</hi> whom <hi>Mahamed</hi> had formerly gained, choſe amongſt his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers thoſe whom he believed were moſt faithful to him, and without any notice taken of it, he placed them at one of the gates of the City, through which he meant to paſs. Night being come, all <hi>Mahameds</hi> deliverers met together at a Randezvouz appointed by them; they brought l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For whereas <hi>Sultania</hi> was not the reſidence of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> they had not ſince the loſs of <hi>Tauris,</hi> is yet erected any magnificent buildings there.

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60144:162"/>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Mahamed</hi> having underſtood in few words, in what manner they would deliver him, ſuffered himſelf to be conducted by him that ſpake to him. All this Troop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with exceeding joy; but fearing leſt they ſhould be troubled with ſome croſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, as ſoon as they had put clothes upon him, which they had brought purpoſely along with them, they went out of the garden, and preſently after forth of the City. About an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces from the gate they found horſes, which the Governor of <hi>Sultania</hi> had cauſed to be there ready provided, and getting upon them, they rode away with all the ſpeed that poſſibly they could make. But whereas the Prince could not guide his horſe, but was conſtrained to let him be lead by another, they could not go ſo faſt, but that the ſecond day of their journey they eſpyed a Troop of Horſe poſting after them, which, being far more in number then they, made them beleeve, not only that they were purſued, but that they were all loſt; nevertheleſs they reſolved to ſell their lives dearly. The Prince too, as blind as he was, cauſed a Scymitar to be given him, and to the end, that if they fought, he might not ſtrike his friends in ſtead of his foes, he commanded his followers not to come near him without calling him by his name; and whereas his eyes did not ſerve him to aſſault any, he reſolved to abide in one place, with an intention not to ſuffer himſelf to be taken alive. But whatſoever he could do, his people placed him in the midſt of them, much againſt his will, being reſolved to dye or to ſave him. In the mean time the Troop, which they beleeved to be their enemies, came ſtill on, and every one was already preparing for defence, when as the ſon of the <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rap</hi> of <hi>Meſapotamiae,</hi> an enemy to <hi>Deliment,</hi> advancing foremoſt, and throwing his Scymitar to the ground, to let them know that he would not fight with them, made them change their reſolution of defending themſelves, into embracing them. Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> underſtanding who he was, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by his voyce, careſſed him exceedingly, and learnt of him, that it was long before his flight was known; becauſe his guard, not having been accuſtomed to enter into his chamber but when he called them, had waited till noon without going in; that the matter being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>Tachmas</hi> at the firſt ſhewed a great deal of fury; that <hi>Perca</hi> had done nothing but laugh at it, and in a bitter jeering manner had wiſhed, that <hi>Soliman</hi> would make him General of his Army, to the end that a man who ſaw ſo clear, might chuſe out the moſt advantageous places for the encamping of his Troops; that for <hi>Deliment,</hi> whereas he hated his father, he accuſed him for having been privy to his eſcape; and that having been ill-intreated by the <hi>Sophi</hi> he was retired from the Court, and had commanded him to come and offer him whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lay in his power, not doubting but he had taken the reſolution to repair to the place where <hi>Axiamira</hi> had already found a ſanctuary; that in the mean time it was requiſite for them to make away with all ſpeed, in regard it might be that <hi>Tachmas</hi> had altered his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and would reſolve to have them purſued. Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> deſired further to know of him who they were that accompanied him, which proved to be the worthieſt men of the Court. The Prince made very much of them; and that he might not hazard perſons to whom he was ſo much obliged, he ſent one of his ſervants before to <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> to know of <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amira,</hi> whether the place of her retreat would not be a ſafe one for them. This while they rode on as faſt as poſſibly they could: but when they were come to the uttermoſt part of the frontire, they ſtayed to hear ſome news from him whom they had ſent to <hi>Bitiliſa. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> came and brought it them himſelf; and this excellent man received Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> with ſo many teſtimonies of joy on either ſide, as they were a long time before they could ſeparate themſelves, or reſolve to march forward. All the reſt came afterwards to ſalute <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> who aſſured them all of his ſervice and protection. <hi>Mahamed</hi> as they rode along enquired after <hi>Axiamira</hi>'s health, but he durſt not ask him any thing of <hi>Felixana,</hi> for fear left he ſhould take that care for an effect of his ancient love. And when as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> perceived ſo much, I thought, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, that after I had aſſured you how <hi>Axiamira</hi> was in the eſtate you deſired her to be, you would have demanded of me how <hi>Felixana</hi> did, ſince having heretofore judged her worthy of your affection, I might well think you would render her that proof of your good will. My dear friend, replyed <hi>Mahamed</hi> ſmiling, I durſt not put my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in mind that I had been his Rival; and though the memory of <hi>Felixana</hi> be infinitely dear to me, that which I owe to your friendſhip kept me from rendering her publiquely, what I will ever render her in my heart: Let not this diſcourſe diſquiet you, continued <hi>Mahamed,</hi> for in acknowledging that I ſhall always be in love with the vertue of this diſcreet maid, I proteſt to you withall, that this love ſhall never beget any other deſire in my Soul, then to ſee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60144:162"/> her contented, that is to wiſh ſhe may be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama's</hi> wife. My Lord, anſwered he, <hi>Felixana</hi> is far more dangerous, and more to be feared then ſhe was, when as ſhe ſurmounted your heart; ſhe hath charms and beauties, which you know not, and which peradventure will make you change your reſolution. You are but too well aſſured, replyed <hi>Mahamed,</hi> that I am a bad Judg of beauty, and that love enters not into my heart by the eye. Neither do I mean, continued <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> that viſible beauty which renders <hi>Felixana</hi> the object of the admiration, as well of ſtupid, as of witty, of vicious, as of vertuous perſons; but I mean that beauty, which is wholly celeſtial; which never makes any but noble Conqueſts; which touches none but great and generous Souls; and which, not deſtroyed by time, begets another love, that laſts eternally. <hi>In fine,</hi> my Lord, that which I mean is the beauty of the mind and ſoul of <hi>Felixana:</hi> When ſhe captived you, ſhe had wherewithall to make one believe that her thoughts were generous; ambition did not move her, and the deſire to be a Queen made her not forget what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e had promiſed. But, my Lord, <hi>Felixana</hi> hath done much more, for ſhe hath deſpiſed death for <hi>Axiamira,</hi> ſhe hath expoſed her ſelf for her, and this rare maid hath teſtified ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and generoſity in divers encounters, as it will be hard for you not to love her, when you ſhall underſtand it. I ſhall love her without doubt, replyed <hi>Mahamed,</hi> but the more worth and vertue I ſhall know in her, the more ſhall I be obliged thereunto; and the more ſhall I be confirmed in the reſolution, wherein I have a long time been, not to eſteem my ſelf happy, but when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſhall be ſo; nor to pretend to any thing from <hi>Felixana,</hi> but that which ſhe cannot deny me without a crime, that is to ſay, her friendſhip. Believe, my Lord, anſwered <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> if there needs nothing but that to content you, you have cauſe to be ſatisfied; for I certainly know, that it would be a hard thing to judg rightly, who carries more affection to you, either <hi>Axiamira, Felixana,</hi> or my ſelf. And be aſſured if you pleaſe, my Lord, that all which I have ſaid to you hath been but to have the pleaſure to ſpeak of <hi>Felixana;</hi> it being moſt certain, that I honor her at this preſent ſo highly, and that ſhe hath rendred the love which I bear her ſo perfect, as jealouſie can never have any place in my Soul.</p>
               <p>With ſuch like diſcourſes <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> without being heard of any but him that guided the Prince, beguiled the time; whil'ſt the reſt entertained themſelves with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Tachmas</hi> in ſuffering himſelf to be governed in that manner, with the malice of <hi>Perca,</hi> the ſtupidity of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and the univerſal hatred that <hi>Deliment</hi> had drawn upon him. But at length after they had travelled a day and an half, this Troop arrived at and <hi>Bitiliſa. Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> were exceeding joyful to ſee Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who not able to enjoy the ſame felicity, was nevertheleſs charmed to hear them ſpeak. <hi>Felixana,</hi> who loved the Prince as much as if he had been her brother, durſt not teſtifie ſo much unto him; but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> being as dextrouſly to diſcover her thoughts, as he had been in diſcerning thoſe of the Prince, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and told her laughing, that he had made certain conditions with <hi>Mahamed,</hi> which he conjured her ſhe ſhould obſerve. Two ſuch ſage perſons, anſwered ſhe, could not reſolve on any thing which is not juſt, wherefore I think that I ſhall not engage my ſelf inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as I ſhall promiſe you not to break them. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> then told her in few words what had paſt between the Prince and him, and <hi>Felixana</hi> promiſed to do that he deſired; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he left her to go and give order for the commodious lodging of all this Troop. The Princeſs would needs ſee all them that came along with the Prince; and with her ſweet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and addreſs ſo abſolutely gained them, as they would have enterprized any thing for her ſervice. Whil'ſt ſhe was complementing, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> giving direction in the Town, <hi>Felixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> came to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and ſuch was their conſervation together, as it knit their friendſhip faſt for all their lives after. He requeſted her ſhe would permit him to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s confident, and would forget the misfortunes which his love had been the cauſe of to her; he thanked her for the ſervices ſhe had rendered to the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira;</hi> promiſed always to honor her more then any perſon in the world; and without ſpeaking to her of love, he gave her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that if reaſon had not prevailed over his inclination, he had ſtill been <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Rival; but it was of that power in his Soul, as he never ſpake a word to <hi>Felixana,</hi> contrary to the promiſe he had made her, to love her no otherwiſe then as his ſiſter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> after he had lodged the Prince in the Caſtle, the reſt in the moſt commodious houſes of the Town, and given order for the intreating of them honorably, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched away a man to advertiſe the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> of that which had paſt, and to beſeech him he would permit that <hi>Bitiliſa</hi> might be a priſon for <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as well as it was for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60144:163"/> 
                  <hi>Axiamira;</hi> undertaking to bring him his head, if this Prince, or any of them that followed him, enterprized ought againſt his ſervice. But <hi>Soliman</hi> was not in an eſtate of thinking on the affairs of his Empire; and the <hi>Grand Viſiers</hi> melancholy was the onely thing that took up his minde. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Embaſſador was come to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and had oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded audience, but could not obtain it. The <hi>Sultan</hi> ſpent the moſt of his time at <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>'s Palace; and though this illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa</hi> was extream weak, yet walked he ſometimes with the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in his garden. It happened then that one morning <hi>Soliman</hi> came to viſit him earlier then he had uſed to do, and having made him paſs inſenſibly into his great chamber, leaning on a Cane garniſhed with gold, which he moſt commonly went with when he was in health, he would needs have him walk down, to the end, ſaid he unto him, he might fortifie himſelf the better by taking the ayr. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who ſought not the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his health, did not obey the <hi>Sultan,</hi> for the reaſon alledged by him, to perſwade him to walk down; but contrarily he did it, out of the belief he was in, that his weakneſs being exceeding great, the more he ſhould put himſelf into agitation, the more would his forces diminiſh, and the neerer he ſhould be to his grave. With ſuch different deſigns did the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> deſcend into the Court; and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> ſeeming as though he would not have the <hi>Baſſa</hi> make too long a walk at a time, cauſed him to lean on the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrade, that divided the Court-yard of his Palace, there to reſt himſelf with him. Scarcely had they been there a quarter of an hour, when as they ſaw an hundred <hi>Janizaries</hi> enter, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired all in cloth of gold, who ranked themſelves in order on both ſides. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ſurprized with this pomp, demanded of <hi>Soliman</hi> what it might be? but he told him ſmiling, that he muſt behold the end of this ceremony, before he could be cleared therein. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> then ſaw the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> enter, who marched alone gorgeouſly apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; He was followed by the high Treaſurer, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Teſtardar,</hi> accompanied with an hundred Slaves, carrying two and two great maunds of ſilver, all full of the richeſt ornaments that the women of the <hi>Levant</hi> do uſe. In ſome of them were little hats, ſet all over with precious ſtones; chopines garniſhed with Turkeyſes and Rubies; ſmocks embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with gold and pearl; moſt ſumptuous gowns, which being layd confuſedly together, made a pleaſing mixture, of curled cloth of gold, of cloth of ſilver, and of velvet, whoſe ground was gold. The laſt maund was not open on the ſides like the reſt, and appeared to be full of all ſorts of jewels, of ſo exceſſive a value, as there were three or four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crowns worth of pearls amongſt them. They which carried theſe precious preſents ranked themſelves all along the baluſtrade, where the <hi>Sultan</hi> and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> were leaning. After this entred twelve charets full of young virgin Slaves, richly clothed, each of them drawn by ſix white horſes, and driven by two Eunuches. Then followed thirty other virgins, apparelled in cloth of gold, accompanyed with ſo many black Slaves, having all of them chains and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of maſſive gold: Theſe Slaves being placed on their knees where the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> appointed them, there entred next two hundred Mules laden with hangings of cloth of gold, of ſattin, of velvet, the ground ſilver; with cuſhions embroidered all over, which are the ſeats of that Country; and with a great deal of the moſt ſumptuous furniture for a houſe. All this being ſet in a moſt marvelous order, four and twenty men advanced, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two and two twelve coffers of <hi>China,</hi> garniſhed with gold and precious ſtones, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed as the reſt, made way for twelve Slaves to be ſeen carrying Torches in their hands, which were covered half way with plates of gold, and ſhined more with the precious ſtones that were on them, then with the flame which conſumed them. Until then the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had beheld this ceremony with a great deal of admiration and aſtoniſhment; but when as after theſe Torches he ſaw twelve other Slaves carry a great Canopy of crimſon velvet, covered with another Canopy, higher then that, and all enriched with plates of gold, the curtains thereof cloſe drawn, reaching to the very ground, he paſſed from aſtoniſhment to grief; eſpecially when he ſaw that this Canopy was followed by a Charet, covered with cloth of gold, drawn by ſix white horſes, and accompanyed with thirty of the faireſt Slaves that ever had been ſeen, being all on horſeback, with their hair hanging looſe upon their ſhoulders, and attired with as much magnificence as gallantry. For calling to minde, that this pomp was like unto that, which the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperors uſe for their own daughters, when as they cauſe them to be conducted to the Palaces of them, whom they give them for husbands, he beleeved that <hi>Soliman</hi> would at length conſtrain him to marry <hi>Aſteria,</hi> to binde him wholly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60144:163"/> to his ſervice; and in this thought he had already reſolved to loſe his life, both out of a ſenſe of love, and out of a ſenſe of Religion, before he would conſent unto it. But he was ſtrangely ſurprized, when as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had made a ſign to the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to draw the curtains of the Canopy, to ſee upon a white ſteed, held by two black Slaves, his incomparable <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Ah my Lord! cryed he out in <hi>Italian,</hi> Is not this an illuſion? may I beleeve that I ſee? and do not my eyes beguile me? And then loſing all reſpect in this encounter, he went maugre his weakneſs, and without attending <hi>Soliman</hi>'s anſwer, to help the Princeſs off from her horſe, and to clear himſelf throughly of the doubt whereinto this ſurprize had put him; but he could not execute his deſign, for the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> had rendered him that ſervice already, and had conducted her to the half pace of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrade, where the <hi>Baſſa</hi> received her. This Princeſs had not ſeen him yet, becauſe at ſuch time as the curtains, which concealed her, were drawn, the ſight of ſo great an aſſembly had not permitted her to mark him, though ſhe had carefully ſought about with her eyes to finde him out. But when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> advancing towards her, did by the ſound of his voyce force her to look that way, ſhe had no leſs joy then he, though not ſo much amazement; for ſhe knew well enough that he was at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſhe beleeved too that ſhe had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly brought away by his order, for <hi>Rustan</hi> would never tell her any thing. And though this violent deſign was not pleaſing to her, yet felt ſhe nothing but joy for all that at this firſt v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew; nor did the paleneſs and change, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s melancholy had painted in his face, any whit afflict her; being very glad to ſee the marks of his love, in thoſe of his grief. Is it poſſible, Madam, ſaid <hi>Ibrahim</hi> unto her, that I ſhould once more ſee the incomparable <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella?</hi> Is it from Love or Fortune that I hold this grace? Neither from the one nor the other, replyed <hi>Soliman</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> who was come to the top of the half pace, but from the good-will which I bear thee, and from the deſire I have to preſerve thy life. This voyce brought reſpect again unto <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who told the Princeſs that ſhe ſaw the greateſt Monarch of the world, for fear ſhe ſhould not render unto <hi>Soliman</hi> the honor that was due to him. <hi>Iſabella</hi> would inſtantly have caſt her ſelf at his feet, when as this Prince raiſing her up, againſt the cuſtom of the <hi>Grand Signiors,</hi> and beholding her with a great deal of admiration, I do not marvel, ſaid he unto <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that love hath been ſtronger in thee then friendſhip; and that the ſight of ſo rare a creature hath been dearer to thee then all my favors: But it is not requiſite that ſo many perſons ſhould be ſpectators of thy felicity; and it will be enough, if thou ſuffer me to be partaker of it with thee. Saying ſo, he commanded the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> to cauſe all that had been brought thither to be carryed into <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Palace, and to ſend every one away but onely thoſe which were to ſerve the Princeſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Emilia,</hi> who came in the Charet, that followed the Canopy under the which <hi>Iſabella</hi> had been placed, lighted out of it, and repaired to her; the Slaves that were deſtined to wait on her in her chamber followed her alſo, and in that order, the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> marching foremoſt, and leaving <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to lead <hi>Iſabella,</hi> they went up the ſtairs, entred into his chamber, and paſſed into his Cabinet; where they were no ſooner arrived, but the <hi>Sultan</hi> beginning to ſpeak acquainted the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> how having ſeen that his melancholy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and knowing that the abſence of <hi>Iſabella</hi> was the cauſe thereof, he had deſired to make it ceaſe without parting with him. That beſides, to the end there might be nothing wanting to his felicity, he had not cauſed her to be thus brought away, without conſidering the ſequel of it, and that the Princeſs might live contentedly in his Empire, where ſhe ſhould always have as much power as he. That for ſo much as regarded her Religion ſhe might not only be a Chriſtian in her heart as he was, but even in the ſight of all the people. That there were examples of the ſame in the <hi>Othoman</hi> family; that <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond was the ſon of the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To all theſe particulars <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had nothing to ſay but to thank <hi>Soliman;</hi> for although upon a ſecond thought, the joy to ſee <hi>Iſabella</hi> again was croſt with ſome unquietneſs, yet he found no occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. The Princeſs on her ſide, coming thus to learn, that it was not <hi>Ibrahim</hi> which had cauſed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60144:164"/> her to be brought away, was much comforted therewith; being very glad to ſee that his own intereſt had not carryed him to expoſe her to ſuch a violence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Soliman</hi> continued beholding <hi>Iſabella</hi> with a world of admiration; for albeit the grief ſhe had been in had a little altered her, yet the joy to ſee <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſpirits, had brought a carnation into her cheeks, which covered all the marks of her melancholy; and which rendred her as fair, as ever ſhe had been. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being ſurprized with too much attention in conſidering this Princeſs, deſired at leaſt-wiſe that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> might not interpret it amiſs; ſo that to conceal it in ſome ſort, it muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid he unto him, that thou hadſt reaſon to aſſure me, that the pictures, which thou haſt placed in thy chamber, reſembled this Princeſs but very imperfectly; for the more I ſeek for the ayr and features of thoſe pictures in her face, the leſs compariſon do I finde in them.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the Princeſs had not anſwered to <hi>Soliman</hi>'s diſcourſes, ſave with obeyſances and ſubmiſſions, but hearing her ſelf ſo highly praiſed, ſhe fell a ſpeaking, and humbly beſought the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> he would be pleaſed to juſtifie the love, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> bare her, by ſome other way, then by that of her beauty. She told him, that if he had not ſtronger chains then that, he would be blame-worthy for preferring her before his Highneſs; but without conſidering, either her merit, or her beauty, he was to think, that the affection which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to her, was one of the inevitable effects of ſympathy or ſate. That ſhe requeſted him to beleeve, how <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had done nothing, but what he could not chuſe but do; that he knew without doubt as well as ſhe, that the glory to ſerve ſo great a Prince, was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all things; but his knowledg being the leaſt of that which governed his will, he had abandoned Reaſons party, to follow that of love. <hi>Soliman</hi> raviſhed with the wit of this Princeſs, deſired her to pardon him for her forcible bringing away, and to remember that he had not undertaken it, but to ſave <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life. So fair a cauſe, anſwered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, could not produce a bad effect, and whatſoever can ſave <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> can never wrong <hi>Iſabella.</hi> With ſuch like diſcourſes, the <hi>Sultan</hi> and theſe two illuſtrious Lovers entertained themſelves very pleaſingly; but dinner time approaching, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> told the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that having purpoſed to beſtow the <hi>Sultania Aſteria</hi> upon him for a wife, and his love not permitting that he ſhould be ſo happy, as to have the moſt excellent man upon the Earth in his allyance, he would at leaſt-wiſe bring him <hi>Iſabella</hi> with the ſame pomp, and with the ſame ceremony, as if ſhe had been his daughter indeed. After ſo obliging a diſcourſe, he retired, leaving <hi>Iſabella</hi> extreamly ſatisfied, both of his wit, his courteſie, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.</p>

               <p>AFter the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had waited upon the <hi>Sultan</hi> forth, he returned to <hi>Iſabella</hi> with ſo much tranſport and joy, as he had never felt the like before; the liberty to be able to ſpeak to her, without other witneſſes then <hi>Emilia,</hi> was ſo ſweet unto him, that neither the remembrance of what was paſt, the care of the preſent, the fear of the future, nor even the weakneſs which his melancholy had brought upon him, was ſenſible either to his body or his minde. I would undertake more exactly to deſcribe the apprehenſions of theſe two illuſtrious perſons, were I not perſwaded that one had need to have made tryal of the like miſadventures, and the like pleaſures, before one could worthily acquit himſelf thereof. After the firſt tranſports, which unexpected joys do cauſe in a ſoul, and which for the moſt part do ſomewhat diſorder Reaſon, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> coming to conſider the eſtate wherein they were, found that Fortune had but gilded over their Irons; yet was it ſome conſolation to them, that they might wear them together. I would not follow you to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> without being your wife; nor would I likewiſe that love ſhould have carryed you to make me be forcibly brought away: but ſince without your or my being guilty thereof, Fortune hath conducted me hither, I have courage enough to endure this noble
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60144:164"/> captivity with you, until we may meet with ſome means to get out of it with honor.</p>
               <p>After many other diſcourſes <hi>Ibrahim</hi> cauſed dinner to be ſerved up to the Princeſs in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, during the which he went to give order for preparing him a lodging at <hi>Achmat</hi>'s Palace, which was not far from his, intending out of reſpect to leave this wholly to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but ſhe being inſtantly advertiſed thereof by <hi>Emilia,</hi> who had heard him give order for it to the <hi>Italian</hi> Slave that ſerved him, ſhe ſent for him, and conjured him not to do ſo; I am well aſſured, ſaid ſhe unto him, that in the Country where we are, I ſhall not claſh with civility to remain here with you; and I know you to be ſo wiſe and diſcreet that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear any unjuſt deſigns from you; withall you underſtand me too well for me to doubt, that you will make any ill conſtruction of the liberty I give you: It will be enough then for you to quit your lodging, without quitting your Palace unto me, which how fair ſoever it is, cannot be agreeable to me without you. This illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa</hi> would not yeeld at firſt, but at length he obeyed the Princeſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they who ſaw <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> could not doubt but that <hi>Soliman</hi> had found out the right remedy, which could throughly chaſe away his melancholy. His eye was quicker, his countenance more lively, his ſpeech ſtronger, his gate more ſteddy, and this change was ſo great and ſudden, that every one ſpake of it as of a prodigy. <hi>In fine,</hi> the preſence of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> did that in a few days, which the art of the Phyſicians could not do in a very long time; and the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> found himſelf in ſo perfect an health, as he had never been in a better. But whil'ſt he was happy, <hi>Soliman</hi> did not enjoy ſo great a tranquillity: The ſight of <hi>Iſabella</hi> through an inevitable fate had excited trouble in his ſoul. For whereas he had eminently met in the perſon of this Princeſs with all the beauties of <hi>Roxelana</hi> and <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and a great deal of reſemblance of both of them, eſpecially of the laſt, he could not chuſe but be in all the paſſion for her alone, which he had been in for the other two. This great Prince render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not himſelf for all that without fighting; and it may be he had not been vanquiſhed, if at the beginning he had known the forces of his Enemy. But what trouble ſoever the firſt ſight of <hi>Iſabella</hi> brought to his heart, he thought notwithſtanding that Reaſon, and his friendſhip to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> would be ſtronger then his inclination. It was not becauſe he had not tryed the weakneſs of the former; but for the ſecond, he beleeved that nothing could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. In this confidence, the firſt days of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s being at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was not as yet in an eſtate to go to the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> he continued viſiting him as he was wont to do: But the more he ſaw <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the more charming he found her; he always obſerved ſome new grace in her; and her wit making her ſtill to be more known, his paſſion ſtill augmented the more: Howbeit he perceived not the violence and power of it, till ſuch time as civility would no longer permit him to ſee her. For the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſtrength enough to go to the <hi>Serraglio, Soliman</hi> having no more pretext to viſit him, ſaw himſelf deprived of the ſight of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and by this privation he felt in his heart that this perſon alone could make up all his felicity, or all his miſery. This Prince no ſooner knew the force of this Enemy, by which he had ſuffered his ſoul to be ſurprized, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What! ſaid he to himſelf, unjuſt and cruel that I am, cannot I, after the obtaining of ſo many Victories abroad, vanquiſh my ſelf this once? muſt I be mine own cruelleſt Enemy? and muſt this predominant paſſion, that reigns in my heart, be always ſtronger then Reaſon? cannot I love, continued he, but I muſt be criminal? and is my deſtiny ſo unlucky, that I cannot be happy, without violating all that is moſt ſacred in the world? All the Earth yeelds me Slaves; the faireſt women of all <hi>Greece</hi> are in my power, and in my <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and in the mean time I will raviſh from the onely man that I love, the onely perſon that he can love, the onely perſon that can preſerve his life; he that, being the nobleſt of men, hath ventured it an hundred times for the ſafety of this Empire, and he that rather then he would break his word with me, had reſolved for death in abandoning <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Ah, no, no; let us rather dye, then conſent to this unjuſt paſſion; l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t us deprive our ſelves for ever of that which onely can make us happy, ſince we cannot be ſo without ingratitude and baſeneſs.</p>
               <p>After ſo juſt a reaſoning, <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeemed ſometimes to be eaſed, and to have taken an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable reſolution to think no more of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s charms. But her image no ſooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf to his minde, but changing his reſolution, he alſo changed his diſcourſe. I know very well, ſaid he, regarding things as I do, that I owe much to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> but I know
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60144:165"/> withall, that I owe very much to my ſelf. It is not always reaſonable for one to give himſelf death to ſave the life of his friend; I am not ignorant that friendſhip ought to be firm, but yet I know, that love hath not uſed to reſpect it. And then again, who knows whether <hi>Ibrahim</hi> will yeeld <hi>Iſabella</hi> to me? he that could reſolve to leave her at <hi>Monaco</hi> to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> may peradventure yeeld her to me for the ſaving of my life. For what can a man do leſs for me, whom I have drawn out of Irons, and from the grave, and have made the mightieſt man in my Empire? Let us love then, ſaid he, ſince we may do it without a crime. But alaſs! continued he, when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> hath conſented to my love, I have not vanquiſhed <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and then he called to minde the conſtancy which ſhe had ſhewed ever ſince the firſt day that ſhe had begun to love <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> This difficulty for all that ſeemed not ſo great unto him, but that he hoped to overcome it, if he could abſent the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> as the affairs of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſeemed to require. Whereupon he framed the deſign of it, after he had a long time combated in himſelf, and prepared to give audience to the Embaſſador the <hi>Sophi</hi> had ſent to demand <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> of him; ſeeming to have no other thought then that of the affairs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> nor other object, but the good of his Empire. He alſo let <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> know, that what he had demanded for <hi>Mahamed</hi> was granted him; and the care of his <hi>State</hi> ſeemed to take him up in ſuch ſort, as albeit he became very melancholique, and that his countenance was altered, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſuſpected no other thing, but that the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty wherein he was, whether he ſhould make uſe of the perſons of <hi>Axiamira, Mahamed,</hi> and <hi>Felixana,</hi> whom he had in his hands, for the making of ſome propoſitions of peace, becauſe he was preſſed by the affairs of <hi>Hungary,</hi> or that he ſhould continue the War of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> conſidering their fortune, could not well imagine by what way they might obtain their liberty; it being incredible that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the deſign of forcibly bringing away the Princeſs, for to let her return again into her Country, and to deprive himſelf for ever of a man, from whom he ſeemed to be inſeparable. So as not knowing what to do, or what to reſolve on, the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> propounded unto her, conſidering the eſtate wherein things were, that ſhe would permit him to make one warlike voyage more againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> to the end, that having repaired the diſorders which his abſence had cauſed in that Kingdom, he might at his return come and caſt himſelf at the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s feet, and demand for a reward of his victories onely the liberty of returning into his Country; with the reſolution, that if he did not grant that which he deſired of him, not to be more generous then he, and to obtain that by ſlight which he had refuſed him, ſince, as it ſeemed to him, he might do it without injuſtice. At firſt this propoſition ſurprized <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> and her heart perſwaded her, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had not Reaſon on his ſide. What, ſaid ſhe, will you always abandon me? and will you finde no place in all the world where we may live together? when you were come to <hi>Monaco,</hi> you quitted me to return unto <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> and now that Fortune hath brought me thither, you will abandon me to go into <hi>Perſia;</hi> but with this grievous difference, that when as you quitted me at <hi>Monaco,</hi> you left me in my Country; your perſon was the onely thing that I loſt; your abſence made up all my grief; and fear found no place in my ſoul but for the love of you: But in this encounter I have cauſe to be afraid of all things. You will abandon me in a Country, whoſe language, manners, cuſtoms, and Religion, are different from ours, and where vertue is not found but in the perſon of <hi>Soliman.</hi> I will not make uſe, continued ſhe, of the Reaſons, which you made uſe of, when you would not let me come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in making me conſider what would become of me if it happened that you ſhould dye: But that is not my fear, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is certain, that in what place ſoever of the Earth this misfortune ſhould arrive unto me, I ſhould always be equally ſenſible of it; that nothing can increaſe or diminiſh my grief; that I ſhall every where finde the remedy to finiſh it; and that my death would without doubt keep me from regretting yours. I do not fear you ſhould dye without me, but I am afraid to live without you. Do not think then of abandoning me, and if you will go into <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſuffer me to go along with you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> hearing the Princeſs ſpeak in this ſort, knew not what to anſwer her; and though he found no other way of hoping to obtain from <hi>Soliman</hi> the liberty which he deſired, yet durſt he not oppoſe <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s pleaſure. Do, Madam, what ſhall ſeem good unto you, ſaid he unto her; diſpoſe of my fortune, and my life; and beleeve, if you pleaſe, that the ſame
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60144:165"/> reaſon, which carryed me to abandon you at <hi>Monaco,</hi> hath now induced me to make this propoſition unto you. But do not think of following me to the war; it is the onely thing wherein I may contradict you in this encounter, and I am reſolved never to conſent unto it. I will not go into <hi>Perſia,</hi> if you enjoyn me to it: I will go and make <hi>Soliman</hi> deny me our liberty in demanding it of him; I will even endevor to think of our ſlight if you will; and by all theſe ways expoſe you, it may be, to ſtrange miſadventures: I will notwithſtanding conſent to all theſe things, if you command me; but I will never endure that you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a warlike voyage.

               <p>I know well enough, anſwered the Princeſs, that I am of a ſex which ought not to ſee war ſave in picture; but what will you have me do? I ſee too well, continued ſhe, that we are in a deplorable eſtate, and that we cannot ſeek for a remedy, whereof the event is not very doubtful. After the obligations wherein you ſtand engaged to <hi>Soliman,</hi> there is no talk of ſlight; yea and I feel in my heart ſomething that reſiſts it. On the other ſide, I know full well that in the eſtate wherein the affairs of his Empire now ſtand, and his friendſhip to you conſidered, it will not be eaſie for my tears to obtain our liberty; and from thence I judg, that nothing but generoſity alone can conſtrain him not to refuſe us. Upon the victory over the <hi>Perſians</hi> our freedom depends, if it be ſo that we may ever obtain it; but I fear too, that this remedy is not very well aſſured. For if you prove not fortunate in this war, how dare you demand your liberty? and if you be victorious, it is to be feared that in fighting for <hi>Soliman,</hi> you fight not againſt your ſelf; that the conqueſts you ſhall make for him, do not keep him alſo from reſolving to part with you; and in this ſort, I cannot make uſe of the power which you do give me to diſpoſe of you in this occaſion, my reaſon not being ſtrong enough alone of it ſelf to take any reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſaw that all the Princeſſes Objections were ſo powerful, as he could think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing able to deſtroy them. But at length, after well examining the matter, they found how it was true, that it might happen the voyage of <hi>Perſia</hi> would ſerve them to no purpoſe: but they found withall, that it was the onely thing that could be beneficial to them; knowing well enough, that if <hi>Soliman</hi> could be vanquiſhed, it would be onely by generoſity. <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> aſſured the Princeſs as much as poſſibly he could, that no misfortune ſhould arrive to her in his abſence, relying in ſuch ſort on <hi>Soliman</hi>'s friendſhip to him, as he could not doubt but that he would be very careful in protecting her. And though he knew that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was very ſuſceptible of love, and that he had feared before at <hi>Monaco,</hi> leſt he would have been too ſenſibly touched with <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s beauty, if ſhe obſtinately perſiſted in her determination to follow him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> yet had he no fear of it in this encounter. That which gave him this tranquillity of ſpirit, was becauſe he knew, that this Prince had never been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but with the firſt ſight of the perſons whom he had loved; that love never entred into his heart but by ſurprizing him; and that whomſoever he had once ſeen without paſſion, was not able afterwards to touch him with any. And whereas <hi>Soliman,</hi> contrary to his cuſtom, had taken great care to conceal his thoughts, he had not perceived his love to <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but contrarily, thinking that he had ſeen her without loving her, he beleeved that he was ſafe on that ſide. In this Opinion he the more eaſily reſolved for the War of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and whereas he knew that affairs were preſſing, and that the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Embaſſador having had audience, the <hi>Divano</hi> would be held the next day, wherein peace or war for the intereſt of the Empire would be concluded, he conjured the Princeſs to take her laſt reſolution. <hi>Emilia,</hi> who was preſent at this Councel, was on <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s ſide, and perſwaded the Princeſs to conſent to the voyage he would undertake. And to carry her the ſooner thereunto, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> told her fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that diverting <hi>Soliman</hi>'s Arms from <hi>Hungary</hi> would render a great ſervice to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that this action might peradventure obtain from Heaven the liberty which they ſo much wiſhed for. He added moreover, that without doubt this war would not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the manner of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was, not to fortifie their Towns, ſo that having no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſieges to make, the buſineſs according to their cuſtom would be decided by the gain or loſs of a battel.</p>

               <p>Upon theſe and many other reaſons the Princeſs reſolved for this grievous ſeparation, and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having left her, after they had made new proteſtations of fidelity the one to the other, he went unto <hi>Soliman</hi> to begin the preparing of his minde to the war of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This Prince, who never ſwerved from the way of vertue but by conſtraint, had fought ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the paſſion wherein he was for <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as he might perchance have defeated it, or at leaſt-wiſe have never made ſhew of it, had not the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> himſelf contributed to his own misfortune, in propounding unto him his ſending him again into <hi>Perſia.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is very difficult to reject that which may ſatisfie us, it was impoſſible for the <hi>Sultan</hi> to refuſe that which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> offered. He had had ſtrength enough, after a long combate, and after he had an hundred times changed his opinion, to reſolve not to propound this voyage unto him, ſince he could not undertake it without quitting <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but he had not enough not to accept of that which could content his paſſion. He determined for all that, becauſe the matter regarded the good of his Empire, to have it propoſed in the <hi>Divano,</hi> to the end the people ſhould not murmur, and might know that he had not preferred war before peace, until he had well examined the importance of it.</p>
               <p>The day following at ſeven of the clock in the morning, twelve thouſand <hi>Janizaries</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Arms in the great Court of the <hi>Serraglio;</hi> for in regard it was a Councel of War, where the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> aſſiſted in perſon, there was more ceremony uſed then in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vano,</hi> which was accuſtomed to be held for affairs of peace; the Halls of extraordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences were opened, and hung with the richeſt hangings that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had. There was ſeen at one end, under a cloth of <hi>State</hi> of curled cloth of gold, a Throne, raiſed four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees high, covered with gold Tinſel, and in the midſt of it four cuſhions of the ſame ſtuff, for his Highneſs to ſit upon. All along the Hall were little low ſeats, adorned with cloth of ſilver, for the placing of all the Officers of the Empire, who came thither very early, in the richeſt and braveſt apparel that they had. The <hi>Beglierbeys</hi> of <hi>Natalia</hi> and <hi>Lavandali,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> of <hi>Cairo, Siria, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Romelia,</hi> were preſent there; ſo were alſo the <hi>Capitan Baſſa</hi> Governor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all the chiefeſt <hi>Sangiacs,</hi> namely of <hi>Morea,</hi> of <hi>Nicopoli, Philopali, Tricala, Negrepont,</hi> and others; the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> was likewiſe there, together with the <hi>Teſqueregibaſſi,</hi> to execute his charge of principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of <hi>State</hi> if need required: In concluſion, there was not any of all the Officers of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchy lacking there, but onely <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who was not yet ſo well re-eſtabliſhed, as to be preſent at Ceremonies. After they were placed according to their degrees, and that to manifeſt the more greatneſs and reſpect they had attended a long time with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſilence, the two <hi>Capigibaſſi,</hi> or Captains of the Port, entred into the Hall richly clad, having each of them in his hand, for a mark of their charge, an <hi>Indian</hi> Cane garniſhed with gold and ſtones, and went and ſtood on either ſide of <hi>Soliman</hi>'s Throne: After them entred the <hi>Grand Viſier, Ibrahim,</hi> as being chief <hi>Baſſa,</hi> marching alone two paces before the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> whom two <hi>Baſſa's</hi> ſupported under the Arms, and behinde him three of the children of honor, who waited on him in his chamber, and carryed a great cuſhion of cloth of gold, all ſet with precious ſtones of an ineſtimable value: Next after followed a many of other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Empire, and a great part of the principal Eunuchs of the <hi>Serraglio.</hi> When as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> appeared, all they that were in the Hall, both on the right and the left hand, roſe up; and as he paſſed by them, they ſaluted him after their mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He told them, that although he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all things by his abſolute power, yet in regard it concerned the glory of his Arms, the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60144:166"/> greatneſs of his Empire, and the good of his ſubjects, he would not frame any deſign, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating unto them the matter he had in hand; to the end that having acquainted them with the importance of it, they might give him faithful and diſ-intereſſed counſel. After that, he repreſented unto them the victories which he had obtained over the <hi>Perſians</hi> through the valor of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and then, the miſadventures, which his abſence and <hi>

                  </gap>urt had cauſed in that Country. He told them that nothing reſted of all his conqueſts, but the remembrance that they had been made: and whereas he had an intention to carry them to a war, he aggravated with a great deal of vehemency, how ſhameful it would be to the Empire to make peace after they had been laſt beaten. He told them withall notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that having the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> the daughter of the <hi>Sophi,</hi> and Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> his ſon, in his hands, he was in an eſtate, if they thought fit, to tender propoſitions of peace unto <hi>Tachmas;</hi> but that they ſhould well examine before-hand, whether that would not be diſhonorable; and that they ſhould remember, how in publique intereſts particular intereſts were not always to be conſidered, and that the glory of the Empire was to be preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things.</p>
               <p>After he had ſpoken thus unto them, he commanded them to deliver their Opinions, which proved not to be alike, for they were all carryed by different thoughts. Some, won by <hi>Roxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> and <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> oppoſed the voyage of <hi>Perſia;</hi> others, for the ſole intereſt of the people, were of the ſame opinion; ſome again, to pleaſe the <hi>Sultan,</hi> counſelled the war; and others, for their particular intereſt likewiſe, oppoſed peace. Yet did they not for all that deliver their Opinions tumultuouſly, nor without giving reaſons for them; but contrarily keeping a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous decorum in this Councel, they ſpake all ſeverally, and without precipitation. But whereas, according to the order which is obſerved amongſt the <hi>Turks, Ibrahim</hi> was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Opinion firſt, as being the chief in dignity, he was already preparing to ſpeak, when as <hi>Machmut, Cadileſcher</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> who had been ſuborned by <hi>Roxelana,</hi> beſought his Highneſs, that for this time onely that cuſtom might not be followed, to the end th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the Opinions, which ſhould be given in this occaſion, might be the more ſincere. For, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, I am aſſured if the noble <hi>Ibrahim</hi> propounds his Opinion firſt, that it will be impoſſible for me to deliver mine, if it happen to be contrary to his; not becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take the liberty to contradict him if I could, for I know his generoſity too well for that; but becauſe his Reaſon renders it ſelf ſo abſolute a Miſtreſs of anothers, as it is not poſſible for one to conſerve his own ſenſe. A man cannot defend himſelf from him; he perſwades whatſoever he pleaſeth; and one cannot chuſe but gainſay in his minde his own Opinions. <hi>In fine,</hi> my Lord, whether it be for the love that is born him, or for the reaſons that I have alledged, I am very certain, if the generous <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſpeaks firſt, that his vote will carry all the reſt; that there will be but one Opinion found in the whole Aſſembly; and that in this ſort, thy Highneſs will not know our true ſence, but wilt onely underſtand <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s, which doubtleſs we ſhall but ſay over again. It is not becauſe I do not beleeve his counſel to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other that can be given thee; but I conceive, that for divers cauſes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Ibrahim</hi> himſelf, it is requiſite thou ſhouldſt leave us to be guided by our own Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In this ſort it was that the ſubtle <hi>Machmut,</hi> inſtructed by the cunning <hi>Roxelana,</hi> got the order of the <hi>Divano</hi> to be changed; for though this propoſition diſpleaſed the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> yet durſt he not for all that reject it; and ſo much the leſs, becauſe <hi>Ibrahim</hi> himſelf beſought his Highneſs that it might be ſo, after he had notwithſtanding told <hi>Machmus,</hi> that he was not ſo eloquent, as he would make him beleeve; and that he was perſwaded alſo, how all thoſe which he ſaw there, whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> honored with his preſence, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any thing, no more then he, but the intereſts of the Empire, and the glory of his Highneſs.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Baſſa Piali</hi> ſpake firſt, and was of the opinion, that no propoſitions of peace ſhould be tendred, in regard they had been laſt beaten; but withall he was of the minde, that without making ſuch great preparations for war, they ſhould onely ſtand upon the defenſive, and retain Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> whereby without doubt the <hi>Sophi</hi> would ſoon be brought to ſpeak firſt of this peace, which then might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, if it were propounded with reaſonable conditions. <hi>Scander Capitan Baſſa,</hi> ſpeaking in his turn, ſaid, that a great Prince and a great Polician ſhould never be contented with being in an eſtate of defending himſelf; that he ſhould always either carry the war to his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60144:167"/> Enemies, or not make it at all; that it was better to make peace, then not to make conqueſts; that not to aſſail ones Enemy, when one was in Arms, was in a manner to be vanquiſhed, or at leaſt-wiſe to teſtifie fear, or weakneſs; that in this occaſion he did not ſee there was any choyce to be made; that it would be without example to make propoſitions of peace to a Prince, who was contented to offer two millions for the ranſom of his daughter and <hi>Felixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> and that it would ſhew much imprudence, not to prepare for war, after the refuſal of them to him: ſo that in regard they were not to be rendred becauſe they were not priſoners of war, nor to be kept without being in a condition to defend them, his advice was, that to obtain peace, and oblige <hi>Tachmas</hi> to demand it, an Army of five hundred thouſand men was to be levyed, to the end that fear might carry him to propound it advantageouſly for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Machmut, Cadileſcher</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> ſaid, that whereas it was never counted a deſign ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baſe or ſhameful in a Prince to procure the peace of his ſubjects, he conceived that if it were poſſible to make uſe of the perſons of Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> for the obtaining thereof, it was to be done: and ſo much the rather, becauſe in continuing this war, the treaſures of the <hi>State</hi> would be unprofitably exhauſted; the power of the <hi>Sultan</hi> would be impaired by the loſs of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> which would periſh in it; yea and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Arms of the Empire would be once again hazarded: and all this without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any recompence from it, it being abſolutely impoſſible to maintain the conqueſts that were made in <hi>Perſia,</hi> whereof Hiſtory gave ſufficient proof; and therefore if war were to be made, that it was better to fall upon the Chriſtians with an Army of five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, which would ſtrike fear into all <hi>Europe,</hi> amplifie the limits of the Empire, and eternize the name of <hi>Soliman,</hi> rather then to loſe them to no purpoſe: How it would be a ſhame to ſee one day in Hiſtory, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had warred a long time againſt the <hi>Sophi;</hi> that at ſeveral times he had led millions of men into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and after all, that there ſhould not be remaining under the dominion of his ſucceſſors, ſo much as one foot of ground of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts he had made there. Finally he concluded, that not this war, but the other, was to be thought on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſuf, Cadileſcher</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> maintained this Opinion, though out of a different meaning; for the former was carryed by the perſwaſions of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and he by the ſole conſideration of the publique good. But he added to the others Reaſons, that if the war of <hi>Perſia</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued longer, whole Provinces might revolt, by reaſon of the poverty whereunto the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of commerce would reduce them; in ſo much that this forraign war might cauſe a civil, more dangerous and more deadly then the other; that if this miſchief ſhould arrive, as the murmuring of the people ſeemed to threaten, they ſhould then be conſtrained to propound a ſhameful peace to <hi>Tachmas,</hi> who it may be, to make uſe of this advantage, would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it; that ſo they ſhould have Enemies both without and within, whil'ſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which were but Tributaries of the Empire, might poſſibly undertake to ſhake off the yoke which had been layd upon them; and that all Chriſtendom beſides might peradventure unite their forces together, ſeeing <hi>Soliman</hi> buſied elſewhere, ſo reconquer that which had been taken from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hali,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, was of the opinion, that not onely there ſhould no Articles of peace be propounded, that not onely there ſhould be preparations for war, but even that no propoſitions from the <hi>Sophi</hi> ſhould be accepted of, if he happened to make any. How it was juſt that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould ſurpaſs his predeceſſors in ſomething; that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered from the Chriſtians, as well as he; but that none had conſerved that which they had won from the <hi>Perſians;</hi> that it was for him to change this order; that it was a weak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, that ſince they had conſerved themſelves till then maugre all the <hi>Othoman</hi> power, and that the victorious <hi>Selim,</hi> his Highneſs Father, had vanquiſhed them with loſs, therefore one could do no more; that contrarily it was a mark their ruine was neer; that Empires had their ages as well as men, and being ſubject to the revolutions of fortune, it was credible that this extraordinary conſtancy, which ſhe had ſhewed in protecting of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> would quickly change; that it being ſo, it was not to be doubted but that this illuſtrious vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was reſerved for the greateſt Prince, that hath been ſince <hi>Alexander,</hi> the moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hero's of antiquity, and the moſt in veneration amongſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> that the Empire of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was not ſo flouriſhing as it was at ſuch time as it was overthrown, nor <hi>Soliman</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:60144:167"/> leſs valiant, then he who had conquered it; that in <hi>fine</hi> it was reaſonable, after the <hi>Sultan</hi> had travelled ſo much for the felicity of his Subjects, that his Subjects alſo ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his glory: ſo as he was of the opinion, that without conſidering whether the people murmured or no, an expedition ſhould be made into <hi>Perſia</hi> with all the Forces of the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Achmat Baſſa,</hi> ſpeaking in his courſe, conſented indeed to the voyage of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but not to the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Next was the <hi>Beglierbey</hi> of <hi>Romelia</hi> of the ſame opinion; He of <hi>Carro</hi> concurred with him; and all the reſt being divided amongſt the ſeaven that had already ſpoken, it was for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to deliver his advice; but he was conſtrained to attend a little, becauſe <hi>Machmut</hi> ſaid a ſecond time to maintain his firſt opinion, that it would be a ſhame to be expoſed to the loſs of the advantage which they had over the Chriſtians. <hi>Achmat</hi> anſwered, that it would be a greater to demand peace after they were beaten. The <hi>Baſſa Piali</hi> added, that extream reſolutions were dangerous to Monarchies; and that in the end Princes, which loved their Subjects, and whoſe Empire was great enough, ought not to make War, but for the procuring of peace. <hi>Iſuf,</hi> to fortifie this opinion, ſaid further, that the people were not to be ſo little conſiderable with the Emperor, ſince from them came his riches, his force, his power, and his greatneſs; that the people had in ſome parts of the world been happy without Kings, but no Kings could be ſo without Subjects: He ſaid likewiſe, that prudence never did any thing precipitouſly, and ſtill would have the Prince ſpare the blood of his people. But the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea replyed, that it was oftentimes juſt and neceſſary to loſe one part of his Subjects for the preſervation of the other; and that an Empire was a great Body, for the maintenance whereof all things might be done, without conſidering particular intereſts. <hi>Scander</hi> added, that a great Prince was never to make peace but with the ſword in his hand, and that the way to keep the people from murmuring, was to make it advantageouſly; that for the effecting thereof five hundred thouſand men were to be raiſed, to the end they might obtain that by force which could not be obtained by any other mean.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Baſſa</hi> having given over ſpeaking, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> repeated in order all the opini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns that had been given; he confuted that of the <hi>Baſſa Piali;</hi> approved that of <hi>Scander Capitan Baſſa;</hi> mightily oppoſed <hi>Machmut</hi>'s advice, as alſo that of <hi>Iſuf;</hi> commended the generous reſolutions of <hi>Ali</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, and the prudent conſiderations of <hi>Achmat,</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception nevertheleſs of the praiſes he had given him. But at length for a concluſion he ſaid, that great Princes were always to give peace, and not to demand it; that if <hi>Soliman</hi>'s children had happened to have been the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s priſoners, all that could then have been done was but to propound it; and that even <hi>Tachmas</hi> was ſo generous as not to do it, though Prince <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> were in his Highneſs hands; that it was a gallant thing in the Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That this were to yield up the Victory, and to render ones arms to his Enemy, to implore the pity of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, to augment the courage of his adverſaries, to weaken that of his Soldiers, and even to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of having done an unworthy act unprofitably; that beſides, the only mean to keep Chriſtendom from uniting their Forces for the deſtruction of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, was to let it breathe a little after ſo much War, becauſe if it were further provoked, it might peradventure do that which it would not do, were it left in reſt; that it was many times dangerous to proſecute ones enemies too much; that tempting Fortune ſo often, ſhe might be weary of favoring, and at laſt abandon thoſe whom ſhe had protected; that to keep her from changing, we were to change our deſign, and ſuffer our ſelves to be conducted by her, and not force her to follow us; that after all, he did not find, that any deliberation was to be

                  <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but they, who had been of a contrary opinion to his, ſeeing the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> favor his party, began to change theirs in appearance; profeſſing that his reaſon had cleared theirs. And <hi>Machmut</hi> was he alone, who ſeeming to yield as the reſt, oppoſed himſelf ſtill notwithſtanding to this reſolution: But <hi>Soliman</hi> having made a ſign to him to hold his peace, he kept ſilence as well as the reſt of the aſſembly; and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> having commanded the bringing in of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Embaſſador, ſpake ſoftly to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> but yet finiſhed his diſcourſe aloud in giving him order to anſwer this Embaſſador according to his ſence, ſo that as ſoon as he appeared, the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> roſe up, and after he had made a low obeiſance to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he told him how he was to aſſure the <hi>Sophi</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from his Highneſs, that his <hi>State</hi> ſhould always be an inviolable ſanctuary to all oppreſſed Princes; that the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira</hi> and <hi>Felixana</hi> being no priſoners of War, the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> far from accepting the ranſom which was offered for them, declared by him, that he would become their Protector, as well as Prince <hi>Mahameds;</hi> and that he would ſhortly go with a very mighty Army to execute his Highneſs Commands, and to ſee Juſtice rendred to theſe exiled Princes. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Embaſſador thereupon labored to make it appear, that <hi>Axiamira</hi> not having been intreated as a perſon ſled for refuge, ſince ſhe had been in priſon, was to be taken for a priſoner of War; and for a concluſion he added, that if ſhe were not delivered up, the <hi>Sophi</hi> would come with an Army of two hundred thouſand men to make her be rendred unto him. But the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> having anſwered him, that he would ſave him the labor of coming ſo far, and that he would go and meet him even in his own Country, he was conſtrained to withdraw, as he did with ſatisfaction little enough. He was no ſooner gone forth, but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> aroſe, after he had commanded the Officers of the Empire, in all things to obey <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as if it were himſelf, and in particular the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea to prepare for his departure with the Naval Army, to go and fall upon <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> of purpoſe to make a diverſion, and divide the Enemies Forces.</p>
               <p>After this Commandment, the <hi>Sultan</hi> returned in the ſame order as he came, only one of the <hi>Capigibaſſi</hi> remained in the Hall, to the end that according to the cuſtom he might cauſe all thoſe, which had aſſiſted in this extraordinary Councel, to be preſented with a rich Gown, which is given to all the Officers of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchy, from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> ſo often as he honoreth the <hi>Divano</hi> with his preſence, which happens but ſeldom. The two <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s which conducted the Emperor having left him alone with <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he told him that there reſted nothing for him now but to take his leave of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> becauſe all the Troops, which had been levyed for the making up of his Army, being already far advanced, all that he could do was to overtake them upon the frontire; that he was ſorry he was conſtrained to ſeparate him from a perſon that was ſo dear unto him; but he was to remember that glory was the faireſt Miſtreſs in the world, and how it was not but for her that he abandoned the Princeſs. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> anſwered thereunto, that the ſole glory of his Arms carried him on, for he aſſured his Highneſs, that in the voyage he was going to undertake, he conſidered not himſelf at all; and in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60144:168"/> mean time, that he might part with ſome ſatisfaction, he beſought him he would promiſe to protect <hi>Iſabella</hi> in all things during his abſence; and if he happened to dye in this War, that he would ſend her back in ſafety to any place which ſhe ſhould pleaſe to make choyce of. This diſcourſe touched <hi>Soliman;</hi> he was aſhamed of his own thoughts and weakneſs; and little lacked but that craving pardon of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he had opened his heart to him, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his crime with repentance: Howbeit love was the ſtronger, and that vertue, which this Prince followed in all other encounters, was too weak in this for the reſiſting of ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Enemy.</p>
               <p>He abandoned himſelf then unto it, and with an equivocating anſwer promiſed the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> that he would protect <hi>Iſabella</hi> againſt all the world; that there was not any ſubject of his whom he would not ſeverely puniſh if he ſhould diſpleaſe her; that for what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him in caſe he ſhould dye, was a thing whereunto he could not anſwer, that thought being too grievous for him to ſettle his mind upon it; that for her more ſafety during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he held it fit that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould not abide in his Palace, but ſhould paſs away that time in the old <hi>Serraglio,</hi> in the company of his mother, of his ſiſters, and his daughters; that the <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> to whom he was ſomewhat obliged, ſhould take care to entertain her; and that for the exerciſe of her Religion, ſhe ſhould go forth as often as ſhe would; that his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this propoſition proceeded from the remembrance of the ſeditious tumult, which was raiſed at ſuch time as he was in <hi>Natolia;</hi> for whereas the people and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this War was undertaken by his counſel, if by miſchance news ſhould come, either true or falſe, that he had been beaten, he feared leſt the fury of the one or the other, or of both of them together, ſhould fall foul on his Palace, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> be involved in that diſorder. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſeeing a great deal of reaſon in that which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſaid, humbly thanked him for his providence, and told him that he would go and propound the matter to <hi>Iſabella:</hi> But he knew not that this propoſition was made, rather to undo then preſerve her; and that this Prince, whom he beleeved to be ſo generous (as indeed he was when as love did not trouble his Reaſon) thought not ſo much of the Conqueſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as of the Conqueſt of <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this dangerous ignorance he went to the Princeſs, and made that propoſition to her which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had made to him, but not till he had rendred her an account of all that had paſt in the <hi>Divano.</hi> At firſt that name of the <hi>Serraglio</hi> affrighted her, and her modeſty could not ſuffer him to continue ſpeaking without interrupting him; But after ſhe had told him I know not how often that ſhe could not reſolve to go thither, ſhe was conſtrained to alter her mind, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having made it appear to her, that the old <hi>Serraglio</hi> was the only place of all the Orient, where the moſt vertues, and the feweſt vices were. As indeed, it is not inhabited by any but the Mother, Aunts, Daughters, and Siſters of the Emperor, who never have any commerce with the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s of the other <hi>Serraglio,</hi> unleſs it be with the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen, which lives in the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> lodging. For touching the people abroad, they never ſee any of them; having no other entertainment then to learn Needle works and Muſick, which certain Jewiſh women teach them; to walk in their gardens, which are very fair; to receive the viſits which the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſometimes gives them, eſpecially when his Mother is ſtill living; to look out at the windows, which open upon the Port and the City; and to ſee the publique <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This reſolution being taken, the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> gave order to his ſervants to prepare all things for his voyage, that he might part the next day, and expreſly forbad them after that from co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Princeſs in teſtifying to him that ſhe could wiſh he would not abandon her, ſpake to him of their farewel and ſeparation. Remember, ſaid ſhe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60144:169"/> unto him, that in the War, whither you are going, you muſt have a care, not only of your own life, but of mine. Think not ſo much of the victory, as not to think of preſerving your ſelf: And to oblige you thereunto, remember every time you go to fight, that in defending your life, you defend <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s; that upon your return depends her felicity; and that if you love her, you will not think ſo much of vanquiſhing, as to keep your ſelf from being vanquiſhed. That can I never be, Madam, anſwered he, after ſo many glorious marks, which I receive of your affection: And ſince in preſerving mine own life, I ſhall preſerve yours, there is no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which can be redoubted of me, and which I ſhall not eaſily ſurmount. Remember yet, Madam, that on Victory our happineſs depends; that to obtain it I muſt expoſe my ſelf to peril; that in all other things Fortune gives the good that ſhe does, but in War Crowns muſt be violently pluck'd out of the hands of Victory, if one may be permitted to ſpeak ſo. One muſt fight to remain Maſter of the field; one muſt give an example for the Soldiers to follow, and put ones ſelf in jeopardy of being vanquiſhed for to be victorious. I tell you all theſe things, Madam, to the end you may not take it ill, if I dare aſſure you, that I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, but to fight with the more courage. You are a captive for the love of me, it is for me then to deliver you, and therefore do not enjoyn me to manage my life with ſo much care. But, Madam, without anticipating our miſeries through fear; and without encreaſing thoſe, which we feel through the apprehenſion of thoſe which peradventure will never arrive unto us, tell me, I beſeech you, whether you can forgive me all the evils which I have been the cauſe of to you, if you do not repreſent unto your ſelf how you have favorable received the affection of a man, who was once reckoned amongſt your enemies, and who by a ſtrange fate in ceaſing to be ſo, hath been the occaſion of more miſery to you in adoring you, then all your cruelleſt adverſaries, purpoſing to hurt you, could have done. Do not charge your ſelf with the crimes of Fortune, ſaid ſhe unto him, and beleeve that I am generous enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the guilty from the innocent, and never to remember the evils which I have ſuffered, without remembring thoſe withall, which you have endured for me. I am as faulty towards <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> as <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> is towards <hi>Iſabella;</hi> or to ſay better, we are equally innocent; and our innocency it may be cauſes our perſecution, ſince it is ordinary with Fortune to fall foul upon none but vertuous perſons. I hope nevertheleſs, added ſhe, that Heaven will ere long give an end to our captivity, or to our lives. If we were, continued <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in the hands of a Prince, that uſed us ill, and laded us with irons, I ſhould methinks have the more conſolation, for in murmuring againſt the Tyrant that perſecutes us there is ſome to be found: But this Prince, who keeps us captives, does it not but becauſe he loves you; and the rigor of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny is ſo great, as I muſt commend that in him, which is the cauſe of all my miſery. It was in this manner that theſe two illuſtrious infortunate perſons entertained one another until night, when as they parted, more out of civility, then for any deſire they had to ſleep.</p>
               <p>The next morning the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> went to take his leave of his Highneſs, intending to defer his bidding adieu to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and giving his laſt thoughts to one, to whom he had given all his heart, as long as poſſibly he could. <hi>Soliman</hi> received him with an unquietneſs, which he took for a mark of his grief to ſee him depart, but to ſpeak truly of things it was the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat which he had in his Soul. The remorſe of his crime, and the ſhame of his weakneſs, had like to have carried him once more to repent him; nevertheleſs love was ſtill victorious over this illuſtrious Conqueror. This Prince then imbraced <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> after he had talked with him about the War, and had given him an abſolute power to treat of all things without adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing him thereof; and preventing what the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was going to ſay to him, he aſſured him that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould be ſerved during his abſence in all reſpects, as the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen; and that he had given order for Charets to bring her and all her Slaves to the old <hi>Serraglio,</hi> where the <hi>Sultana Asteria</hi> ſhould have a particular care to entertain her. After this, he diſmiſſed <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who went to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Seas Palace, to will him to ſet ſail as ſoon as he could, in regard the Squadrons of <hi>Metelin,</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> of <hi>Ciprus,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were already joyned together; and that with all this Fleet he ſhould ſteer his courſe for <hi>Mingrelia.</hi> This order given, he returned to his Palace, where he found the Charets, which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had ſent, to carry <hi>Iſabella</hi> to the old <hi>Serraglio.</hi> And whereas the hour of parting preſſed him, he went to the Princeſſes chamber to advertiſe her of it, and to deſire her that he might conduct her to the place, which was to ſerve for a ſanctuary to her, during his abſence. She
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60144:169"/> granted him his deſire, without knowing almoſt what ſhe did, ſo extream was her grief. And after a converſation as ſad, as their Souls were afflicted, ſhe reached him her hand, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> kiſſed, with as great a tranſport of grief, as of love. And conducting her with <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> to the Charet, which was prepared for her, he went and accompanied her to the gate of the old <hi>Serraglio,</hi> where they took their laſt farewell.</p>
               <p>It was at this inſtant that they felt that which cannot be expreſt; You had reaſon indeed, ſaid the Princes to him, to ſteal away from me when you left me at <hi>Monaco,</hi> and to ſave me the grief of bidding you farewell; but I do not know, ſaid ſhe unto him, whether you have any now to make me prove it. Is it your pleaſure then, Madam, anſwered he, that I ſhall not part? No, replyed ſhe, do not you ſtick at what I ſay; it is only grief that makes me ſpeak: Go and break our chains, carry a ſtronger heart then I, and that you may not augment my weakneſs, do not oblige me to bid you farewell. As ſhe was ſaying ſo, the gates of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> opened, and <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſeeing himſelf conſtrained to quit her in a place where men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come, aſſured her at this laſt inſtant, that be would quickly return a Conqueror. The Charet was no ſooner entred, but he mounted on horſeback, and without ſpeaking a word more to any body, he went out of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with his Train, to overtake the Troops, which were marching towards <hi>Perſia,</hi> carrying in his heart the moſt ſenſible affliction, that ever he had tryed. He had this advantage nevertheleſs over the Princeſs, that he could enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his thoughts without interruption, but it was not ſo with her. For as ſoon as ſhe had been conducted to a ſtately lodging, which was prepared for her, the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Mother, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lthough ſhe hated <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> came to viſit her followed by all the <hi>Sultanaes,</hi> thereby to pleaſe <hi>Soliman,</hi> who had intreated her unto it. The <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> as the favorite of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror her father, had been permitted to learn the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, after the goodwill ſhe had born to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had made her to deſire it; ſo as it was ſhe that held up the converſation in this viſit, and that expreſſed the compliments of the other <hi>Sultanaes</hi> to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with a great deal of civility, although the extream grief ſhe was in might have diſpenced her from it. But whereas <hi>Aſteria</hi> had addreſs and wit, and knew that <hi>Iſabella</hi> was afflicted, ſhe ſo ordered the matter as this viſit was not long. The <hi>Sultanaes</hi> went away then charmed with the beauty of the Princeſs; and <hi>Aſteria</hi> found her ſelf as much inclined to ſerve her, as ſhe had been before time to ſave the life of <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> It is true, that though they were all gone but this laſt, yet was not <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas agriculture hath ſomething delightful in it, and that the gardens of the <hi>Serraglio</hi> are the faireſt in the world, <hi>Soliman,</hi> to ſatisfie both the cuſtom, and his Religion, which requires it, had many times watered with his own hand the flowers which he ſent to <hi>Iſabella.</hi> He gave her to underſtand, that had it not been for fear of incommoding her, he would have come and comforted her for the departure of <hi>Ibrahim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princeſs received theſe preſents and civilities with a great deal of reſpect, and deſired the <hi>Bostangibaſſi</hi> by the mouth of the <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> to tell the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that if there had not been too much preſumption in letting her ſelf be perſwaded, that he would do her the honor to viſit her, ſhe would have teſtified unto him how dear this glory was unto her; but not daring to hope for it, ſhe contented her ſelf with aſſuring his Highneſs, that ſhe would ſhare in all the obligations wherein the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> ſtood engaged unto him, and that in her particular ſhe would all the days of her life be very ſenſible of them. The <hi>Boſtangibaſſi</hi> being gone, ſhe craved pardon of the <hi>Sultana Aſteria</hi> for the trouble ſhe had put her to in ſerving her for her an Interpreter: and that ſhe might find occaſion to talk to her of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with civility, ſhe thanked her for ſaving of his life in times paſt, told her, that in conſideration thereof ſhe owed her all things, and ſince <hi>Ibrahim</hi> could not acknowledg it to her himſelf, it was for her to do it. <hi>Aſteria,</hi> who certainly had wit, generoſity, and more addreſs, then the retirement wherein ſhe lived ſeemed to permit, anſwered her, that her ſight and acquaintance recompenced her beyond that which the ſervice ſhe had rendered her deſerved? That pity, being a ſenſe ſo natural to the ſex whereof ſhe was, ſhe merited no great glory for having had
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60144:170"/> compaſſion of ſo gallant and handſom a man as <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> For, continued ſhe, although I know very well, that they talk amongſt the Chriſtians of us, as if we were barbarous; yet I can aſſure you, that this rule is not ſo general, but it hath exceptions: And pity, which is a thing quite oppoſite to that which is beleeved of us, is one of the firſt precepts of our Religion; it extends even to unreaſonable creatures; and there are found amongſt us ſuch careful Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Law, as they buy up Birds to let them fly. Judg after this, whether that which I have done, deſerves to be ranked in the number of extraordinary things; and whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily there had not been cauſe to wonder, if ſeeing a man carried to dye, whoſe countenance ſo little reſembled a Slayes, or Malefactors, I ſhould not have had the thought to ſave him. And then again, added ſhe, if any one ought to recompence me for this action, it muſt be the <hi>Sultan,</hi> ſince I have preſerved him a man, whoſe brave actions have rendred his Empire famous, and whoſe merit and converſation hath made up all his felicity ever ſince he was here. For as for you, continued ſhe, I do not ſee how you are obliged to me; if I had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ſaving of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life, you might well have ſaid ſo; but ſince it was I that was the cauſe of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s ſeeing, loving him, and retaining him in his ſervice, methinks I ought rather to demand pardon of you for robbing you of him, then to attend thanks for his preſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who did not think that <hi>Aſteria</hi> was acquainted with all her hiſtory, knew not how to anſwer her, which the <hi>Sultana</hi> perceiving, deſired her not to marvel if ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by her diſcourſe, that ſhe was not ignorant of all her adventures. She told her then how the <hi>Sultan</hi> her father had been almoſt conſtrained to impart them unto her, for a reaſon which ſhe would tell her another time, it being unjuſt to keep her any longer from the liberty of lamenting an abſence, which could not chuſe but be very grievous unto her. <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſo ſatisfied with the civility and wit of <hi>Aſteria,</hi> that ſhe felt ſome conſolation, in finding a reaſonable perſon in a place, where ſhe imagined there had been nothing but ſtupidity; ſo that to oblige her ſhe requeſted her with a great deal of tenderneſs and reſpect not to leave her for that reaſon, nor to defer to another time the acquainting her with that, which ſhe would fain hear, although ſhe knew it. <hi>Aſteria</hi> then recounted unto her, what <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had already told her, namely, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had purpoſed to have married her to him; but ſhe particularizing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further unto her, in letting her know, how this buſineſs had not been ſo haſtily carried, but that ſome days were paſt, after the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had ſpoken to her of it, when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s diſcourſe obliged him, to propound it ſooner unto him then he had intended. That whereas he could not foreſee how this marriage ſhould be diſagreeable to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he had reſolved to have had her conducted to his Palace upon the day of his Triumph, to the end he might do the more honor to the <hi>grand Viſier,</hi> but that he had been hindred from it by a <hi>Perſian,</hi> named <hi>Alibech,</hi> who came to demand Juſtice of him againſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, and had kept him till it was night in the <hi>Hipodrome.</hi> That having learnt all theſe things from the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s own mouth, and ſeeing afterwards that nothing came of all this, ſhe had caſt her ſelf at <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi>'s feet, and beſought him to let her know, for what cauſe <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had refuſed her; and that after many intreaties, having had experience of her diſcretion in other encounters, he had declared unto her the truth of the matter. That after this ſhe had far more eſteemed of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> then before; and that his fidelity to her had in ſuch ſort touched her heart, as far from being incenſed againſt him for the refuſal he had made of her, ſhe had commended him for it in her talk with <hi>Soliman.</hi> Do not diſquiet your ſelf, ſaid this <hi>Sultana</hi> to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> if I dare ſay to you, that I have been your Rival; that <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s glory had touched my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that I could have reſolved with joy to have been his wife; ſince I had not thus opened my heart unto you, if it had not been free enough to offer you all manner of ſervice, and to aſſure you, that that which I felt for the <hi>Baſſa</hi> could not be named Love, but a ſimple deſire to marry a gallant and vertuous man. Do not regard me then as your Rival, ſeeing that could not be without hatred, but as a perſon that hath no ſtronger a paſſion, then to ſerve <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in you. You are too generous, anſwered <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> too happy, for him to be indebted to you. I ſhould condemn him nevertheleſs, continued ſhe, for not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his fidelity to me, had he had the honor to know you, but his misfortune hath made him commit this fault: Do not accuſe him then for want of judgment in preferring my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation before your Conqueſt, ſince his ignorance hath been the cauſe of it; and ſeeing you know my whole life as well as I, lament us without accuſing us.

               <p>This converſation, having laſted an indifferent long time, combined the <hi>Sultana Aſteria</hi> and the Princes in ſo ſtrait a league of friendſhip, as they were almoſt inſeparable, ſo long as <hi>Iſabella</hi> continued in the old <hi>Serraglio.</hi> The day after ſhe was come thither, <hi>Soliman</hi> viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and by this laſt ſight made the chains which captived him ſtronger then before.

He craved pardon of the Princeſs for being the cauſe of his abſence from her; he deſired her not to remember it was he that cauſed her to be brought away by force; and to think that ſhe was in a place, where ſhe might abſolutely command; where ſhe ſhould ſee no body but that would obey and ſerve her with joy. <hi>Iſabella</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſo obliging a diſcourſe with all the civility and acknowledgment ſhe was capable of: but whereas ſhe was ſad, though ſhe conſtrained her ſelf to ſeem otherwiſe, he intreated her to be as merry as ſhe could, for fear leſt melancholy diminiſhing her beauty, it might be layd to his charge, that he had but ill preſerved ſo rare a thing.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs having promiſed him all that he deſired, he went away very much ſatisfied, and very amorous, and left her with as great an eſteem of him, as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> could not have more. And whereas <hi>Asteria</hi> ſeldom abandoned her, ſhe talked to her the reſt of the day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>othing but of the admiration ſhe was in of <hi>Soliman,</hi> of the vertues of this Prince, of the greatneſs of his ſpirit, of that exceeding and generous friendſhip, which he teſtified to our illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Baſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this firſt viſit there were nothing but magnificences in the old <hi>Serraglio. Soliman</hi> ſent every day new preſents to <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and in conſideration of her to the <hi>Sultanaes,</hi> which lived in the ſame place, for fear leſt envying her they ſhould come to hate her, and ſo loſe the care of pleaſing her. And whereas there paſſed not a day, wherein this Prince did not viſit <hi>Iſabella, Roxelana,</hi> who knew him to the very bottom of his heart, quickly perceived the true reaſon that cauſed theſe viſits. Yet did not jealouſie ſeize upon her Soul for all that; and the only deſign of making uſe of this occaſion to deſtroy <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and to labor the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> was that which made her work in the manner, as ſhall be ſeen in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this diſcourſe. But for as much as the <hi>grand Signiors</hi> Mother hated <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> becauſe ſhe loved <hi>Roxelana,</hi> ſhe communicated her ſuſpicions unto her, and they both concluded, that in all likelyhood <hi>Soliman</hi>'s aſſiduity was an effect of love; and that if it were ſo, it would be almoſt an infallible mean to deſtroy the <hi>grand Viſier,</hi> who it was ſaid was deſperately in love with this perſon. For coming to know this paſſion, he would queſtionleſs do things, which would make him be baniſhed, if he did not voluntarily baniſh himſelf.</p>
               <p>Having held this ſecret counſel, <hi>Roxelana,</hi> far from troubling <hi>Soliman</hi>'s deſigns, thought of nothing elſe but making him more in love with the Princeſs; being not jealous but of her authority, and fearing <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s power, much more then <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s beauty. And for this effect, whereas there is ſcarce any faith in <hi>Turkey</hi> of proof againſt preſents, ſhe ſuborned one of the Slaves, who went dayly to offer her ſome new liberality from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to the end that according to the occaſions ſhe might invent ſome obliging compliment to him from <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who ignorant of all theſe things, lived with as much content and reſt, as the abſence of the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> would permit her. <hi>Aſteria</hi> had ſo great a care of her, and <hi>Soliman</hi> rendred her ſo many devoirs, as ſhe had ſcarcely any leaſure to think of her misfortunes. In the mean time the <hi>Sultan</hi> was not a little perplexed, out of the fear he was in to diſcover his love to the Princeſs; for albeit he knew ſhe eſteemed him, yet he beleeved that it was as much for the affection which he ſeemed to bear to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> as for his own merit. So that not daring as yet to declare himſelf openly, he contented himſelf with praiſing her beauty, her wit, and all the excellent qualities which were in her, in talking to her of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and this name, which had been ſo conſiderable with him, was employed againſt him that owed it. For ſo often as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60144:171"/> he commended <hi>Iſabella,</hi> he would exag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rate how happy <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was to be beloved of ſo marvelous a perſon; what judgment <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had ſhewed in the choyce he had made of her; and out of a malicious gallantry he told her many times, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was to blame for aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning her at <hi>Monaco,</hi> to come and keep his word with him; that it was a great fault in him to go to the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, and not to dye with grief, rather then to quit her; that for him, if he had been in his place, he would never have done ſo, thinking it a great deal ſweeter to dye, then to be abſent from her. So artificial a diſcourſe, was not for all that interpreted by <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> as <hi>Soliman</hi> deſired, and without ſeeking for any hidden ſenſe in it, ſhe beleeved that it was a pure effect of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s compliance, who thinking to pleaſe her, would talk to her of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in any manner whatſoever. In this ignorance, ſhe always anſwered him very civilly, and with a great deal of reſpect; ſo that interpreting in this ſort all that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſaid unto her, ſhe put him into an extream pain. For without telling her preciſely, that he was in love with her beauty, he would fain have had her perceive it; being ſo afraid to offend her, that this fear peradventure might have wrought that in him, which Reaſon could not do, had it not been for the meſſages, which the Slave whom <hi>Roxelana</hi> had ſuborned, at ſeveral times brought him.</p>
               <p>But whil'ſt <hi>Iſabella</hi> talked of <hi>Soliman</hi>'s generoſity, all the <hi>Sultanaes</hi> had no other diſcourſe but of the love which he bore her. <hi>Aſteria,</hi> perceiving it as well as the reſt, and knowing to what violences this paſſion carried the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> was much afflicted at it, for <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s intereſt, whom ſhe exceedingly loved. This melancholy was quickly marked by the Princeſs, and whereas her cares and her merit had given her an high place in her affection, ſhe one day conjured her to acquaint her with the cauſe of it. <hi>Aſteria</hi> judging with reaſon, that if ſhe ſhould tell her the truth, it would very much grieve her, excuſed her ſelf from it at firſt as well as ſhe could; but coming to conſider, that it might be the ignorance wherein <hi>Iſabella</hi> lived, might further augment her unhappineſs, ſhe reſolved to confide in her, and to impart unto her the ſuſpicions ſhe had. That which made <hi>Aſteria</hi> be intereſſed ſo ſtrongly for all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as to forget the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s intereſts, was becauſe ſhe had underſtood how mightily he had protected <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Gianger</hi> her brothers, whom ſhe had infinitely loved; and how he had always oppoſed the violences of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> to whom ſhe bore a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hatred, whoſe chief foundation was in her proper vertue. <hi>Aſteria,</hi> following her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, after ſhe had prepared <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s mind by a long diſcourſe, to make good uſe of the advice ſhe was going to give her, and after <hi>Iſab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At firſt this diſcourſe ſurprized her, ſhe changed colour ever and anon, and out of the trouble ſhe was in, ſhe thought that <hi>Aſteria</hi> ſpake not the truth, though ſhe could not imagin any reaſonable cauſe for this fiction. The <hi>Sultanaes</hi> ingenuity notwithſtanding deſtroyed this ſecret accuſation, which ſhe charged her within her heart; and paſſing from one extremity to another, ſhe in an inſtant juſtified not only <hi>Aſteria,</hi> but <hi>Soliman</hi> alſo, and calling to mind all that this Prince had done for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſhe beleeved that the <hi>Sultana</hi> gave an ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> civilities; and took that for teſtimonies of love, which ſhe was perſwaded was but an effect of his friendſhip to <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> This laſt thought having quieted her mind, ſhe thanked <hi>Aſteria</hi> for the care ſhe had of her, commended her genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and wiſdom; and teſtified at laſt how ſhe could not beleeve that ſo great a Prince, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> could be capable of letting himſelf be vanquiſhed by ſo unjuſt a paſſion, as that was whereof ſhe ſpake. I wiſh it may be ſo, ſaid the <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> both for the glory of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and your content; but take heed, as I have already told you, that your beauty be not more powerful in the Soul of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> then his friendſhip to <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> If that ſhould be true, replyed the Princeſs, it would rather be an effect of my unhappineſs, then of my beauty; but I profeſs unto you that I ſhall never reſolve to accuſe this Prince, till I am forced thereunto by himſelf.</p>
               <p>This converſation being ended, and the <hi>Sultana</hi> gone, <hi>Iſabella</hi> found not her ſelf ſo quiet;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60144:171"/> howbeit <hi>Emilia</hi> confirmed her in the opinion, that <hi>Soliman</hi>'s reſpects to her proceeded only from friendſhip, in making her conſider, that <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s conjecture was queſtionleſs grounded on the belief of all the other <hi>Sultanaes,</hi> who ſuppoſed that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> could not have any affection for a woman, but ſtraight it muſt be love; and who out of jealouſie for the preſents that he ſent her, and the civilities that he uſed to her, had imagined it could not be otherwiſe. This reaſoning carrying ſome likelyhood with it, comforted the Princeſs a little, and after ſhe had run over in her memory all that <hi>Soliman</hi> had ſaid, ſhe found, being willing to deceive her ſelf, that all his diſcourſes and all his actions, might be interpreted to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: yet ſaw ſhe not ſo much certainty in all that ſhe imagined, that ſhe durſt abſolutely rely upon it: and though ſhe feared the ſight of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> out of the doubt ſhe was in of finding him guilty, yet had ſhe ſome inſtants, wherein ſhe deſired it, out of a hope of juſtifying him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roxelana</hi> on her ſide, having communicated her deſign to <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and he approving of it, they thought of nothing but of augmenting <hi>Soliman</hi>'s love to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> by the obliging meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which that ſuborned Slave delivered to him dayly. It was at the ſame time, when as there were three marvelous beautiful Slaves preſented to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who without being ever a whit touched with their charms, had refuſed them, if he had not by chance demanded of them whence they were; but having underſtood that they were of <hi>Italy,</hi> he retained them with a purpoſe to beſtow them on <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſeeking after nothing with more care, then to pleaſe her. He went then to viſit her, after he had commanded that thoſe three Slaves ſhould be carryed into the old <hi>Serraglio:</hi> And whereas <hi>Aſteria</hi>'s diſcourſe to her had rendred her more melancholique then ſhe uſed to be, he marvelled at it, and by his much preſſing her to let him know the cauſe thereof, he made the Princeſs apprehend, that the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were juſtly grounded; yet deſtroyed ſhe her ſelf, this her own opinion: and having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that her melancholy was derived from the remembrance of her paſt misfortunes, rather then from any other reaſon, he deſired her to forget them, and not to render her ſelf unhappy with things, which would never arrive to her again. He told her afterwards, that to comfort and delight her, he had choſen her out three Slaves, which it may be would not be diſagreeable unto her; and would underſtand her orders better then the others which had been given her, becauſe they were of her own Country. <hi>Iſabella</hi> anſwered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto very civilly, and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> having commanded them to be brought in, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was ſtrangely ſurprized, when ſhe ſaw that theſe three Slaves were <hi>Sophronia</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Leonora, Leonida, Alphonſo</hi>'s Miſtreſs, and <hi>Hippolita, Doria</hi>'s ſiſter. She had no ſooner perceived them, but ſhe gave a great skrick, then turning her ſelf to <hi>Soliman, May it pleaſe thy Highneſs to pardon me, ſaid ſhe unto him, if I loſe the respect which I owe unto thee, and if the joy to ſee perſons that are ſo dear to me, is ſtronger in me then good manners.</hi> In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, after ſhe had made a low obeyſance to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> ſhe went and embraced her dear friends; who were no leſs amazed and glad then ſhe, to encounter her in a place, where they hoped for no conſolation.</p>
               <p>This firſt complement being over, <hi>Iſabella</hi> once again beſought the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her, if friendſhip and ſurprizal had conſtrained her to fail in that which ſhe owed to him. The incomparable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> anſwered he, can owe nothing to any body; and in what place of the world ſoever ſhe can be, ſhe can never want Slaves. This civility is too exceſſive, replying the Princeſs bluſhing, and I ſhall hold my ſelf infinitely obliged to thy Highneſs, if thou wilt give me for companions theſe three fair maids, whom Fortune hath made thy Slaves. I have already ſaid, anſwered he, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> may command abſolutely; and I ſwear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her further, how there is but one onely thing, which ſhe may not obtain of me.</p>
               <p>After this ſpeech, whereof the Princeſs durſt not demand the explication, <hi>Soliman</hi> would needs know of her, whether theſe three beautiful perſons were of <hi>Genoua,</hi> as well as they were of <hi>Italy;</hi> and when ſhe had informed him that they were, he uſed a great deal of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards them; and enquiring of <hi>Hipolita</hi> where her brother was, he underſtood that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60144:172"/> have fallen on their knees to render him thanks, but he not permitting it, told them, how it was <hi>Iſabella</hi> they were to thank, and not him. And having d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> deſiring to oblige the Princeſs in all things, went away for to leave her at liberty to entertain her dear friends, and to take order for the delivery of thoſe Slaves, whom ſhe had recommended unto him. When he was gone, embraces and civilities began afreſh between <hi>Iſabella</hi> and theſe three fair maids: <hi>Emilia</hi> likewiſe teſtified the ſatisfaction which ſhe had to ſee them; but in the midſt of their firſt apprehenſions of joy, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their pleaſures paſt, made them ſhed tears of ſorrow.

The deſire of demanding one thing was loſt by the curioſity of knowing another, and going both at once to ask the Princeſs queſtions, and to anſwer thoſe which ſhe asked of them, neither of them anſwered preciſely to each other. Howbeit the Princeſs underſtood that thoſe Friends, which were Slaves, as well as <hi>Doria,</hi> were <hi>Horatio,</hi> the <hi>French Marquis,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to hear ſome news of the Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> and of <hi>Leonora</hi> his wife, but <hi>Sophronia</hi> told her ſighing, that ſhe ſhould know their adventures too ſoon; and <hi>Hipolita</hi> added, that in a day wherein Fortune had done them ſo great a grace, it was not fit to remember ſo many misfortunes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who ſeared leſt the name of <hi>Serraglio</hi> ſhould diſquiet them, and make them conceive ſomthing to her diſadvantage, acquainted them with the difference which there was between the old <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and that of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s women. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in her diſcourſe ſhe many times named <hi>Ibrahim</hi> without thinking of it, and ſpake of him, as of a man, in conſideration of whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> favored her, <hi>Sophronia</hi> demanded of her, who this <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was? This queſtion made the Princeſs bluſh, but at length ſhe informed them that this <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> it ſeeming unto her, that in the eſtate wherein their fortune ſtood, it was not requiſite to make a ſecret of his adventures to them. This novelty equally ſurprized <hi>Hipolita, Leonida,</hi> and <hi>Sophronia;</hi> not being able to imagine, but that all which they were told was any other then a fiction: Their own experience forced them notwithſtanding to beleeve, that what had been imparted to them was true, there being no more difficulty in giving credit to that which was arrived to them, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Princeſs received this news with a great deal of grief; and ſhe would fain have obliged him that brought her this meſſage, to have gone and beſought his Highneſs from her, that he would permit her to accompany her friends to the <hi>Grand Viſiers</hi> Palace; but he anſwered her, that the order which had been given him was abſolute, and how he could do no other then execute it.</p>

               <p>IT was no ſooner day, but <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſent to deſire permiſſion of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that ſhe might go and viſit her dear friends, which he durſt not deny, ſo much was he afraid to diſpleaſe her; He repented him nevertheleſs for having made <hi>Hipolita, Sophronia,</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> go out of the <hi>Serraglio;</hi> and feared leſt that which he had done for his content ſhould deſtroy it; for it was true, that he was not carryed thereunto, ſo much by the requiſiteneſs of things, as the doubt he was in, that he ſhould not be able to ſpeak to the Princeſs in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſo long as they were with her. <hi>Iſabella</hi> then, having obtained the permiſſion which ſhe had demanded, went to <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Palace with as much magnificence, as if ſhe had been the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen. <hi>Horatio, Alphonſo, Leonida, Sophronia,</hi> and <hi>Hipolita,</hi> received her with exceeding ſatisfaction, yet was it leſs for all that then <hi>Doria</hi>'s, who having underſtood from his ſiſter, that <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was in that Country, was in ſo extraordinary an impatience to know by what adventure he was come thither again, as he had ſcarcely made his firſt comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when as he conjured her to acquaint him with it: But ſhe, that was in no leſs to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his, and thoſe of his friends, and by what hap they were arrived there, told him, that he ſhould not know it, till he had informed her what good or bad fortune had conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to <hi>Conſtantinople.

                  <p>SEeing our misfortunes, and your retirement, have made you almoſt a ſtranger in your own Country; and that your abſence hath kept you ſince from knowing our miſhaps, I will content your curioſity, and recount all this ſtory unto you, as if you had not been born at <hi>Genoua,</hi> and that all the perſons, of whom I am to ſpeak, were unknown to you; Yet have you not forgotten, as I think, that the Family of the <hi>Fieſques,</hi> being one of the nobleſt, and moſt illuſtrious of all <hi>Italy,</hi> as having twice furniſhed a head to all Chriſtendom, given ſo many Cardinals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo many great men to the world, was that alſo which <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> had always moſt dreaded, ever ſince that action which made him merit the having of a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60144:173"/> Statue at <hi>Genova.</hi> They that intermeddle with the knowledg of things, and that judg not of intentions by appearances and events, will not have the deſigns of <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo diſ-intereſſed, as they have appeared unto us; but <hi>in fine,</hi> this is not a place, where I am to tell you what the Count beleeved concerning him: As for me, that ever ſpeaks ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely of things, I hold that his intentions were as fair as his enterprize.</p>
                  <p>But to come to that which I am to impart to you, and to keep you from being too much ſurprized by the Counts laſt action, I am to tell you, that although in appearance he was the ſweeteſt, the civileſt, the gallanteſt, and of the freeſt and moſt peaceable diſpoſition that ever had been ſeen, and that he gave himſelf to all the exerciſes of a man of his quality, wherein he had profited admirably, yet had he an imperious ſpirit, and was always poſſeſt with ſome great deſign. Ambition, and the deſire of glory, were his predominant paſſions, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things for which he did all others. His education did not contribute ought to theſe thoughts; for whereas he remained yet young enough under the government of his Mother, who was the moſt ambitious woman that ever was, ſhe gave him a part of her inclinations. He had had for his Governor one named <hi>Penſa,</hi> by <hi>Simbaldo</hi> his fathers appointment, whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were wholly noble, and that had inſtructed him in all the faireſt knowledges, which a perſon of his condition might have. But this man being too moderate for the bringing up of the Count according to his mothers deſigns, ſhe placed another about him, but yet without removing the former, to the end that if the one taught him the Sciences, the other ſhould teach him not to make uſe of them, but to arrive at the height of ſoveraign greatneſs. Theſe two men being oppoſite in all things, gave him alſo quite contrary counſels. The firſt made him in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory obſerve the noble actions of thoſe, who had expoſed themſelves for the ſafety of the Commonwealth; and the other made him oftentimes read the Conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi> the lives of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Nero;</hi> Nevertheleſs whereas the Counts inclinations were too vertuous to love crimes, he followed not the advice of this ſame; but his Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall too ambitious to be confined within the directions of <hi>Penſa,</hi> he took a third way, and loved nothing ſo much as the reading of the lives of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> eſpecially of this laſt; and he was wont to ſay, that they which had called him Tyrant were to blame; ſince he can never be ſo, that aſpires not to the ſoveraign power, but for the uſing of it well; and they which found themſelves capable of governing people, were reſponable to Heaven for not imploying a Talent, which might be advantagious to all the world.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſcourſes were not at that time conſidered but by his Mother, who took incredible delight therein: but at length, the Count, being arrived at ſeventeen years of age, ſaw <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Julio</hi> and <hi>Horatio Cibo,</hi> in an aſſembly, where <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and Favorite of <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> was preſent as well as he. You have without doubt obſerved, that <hi>Leonora,</hi> though gentle and civil, had for all that a majeſtick reſervedneſs, which ſhewed in her behavior that ſhe had ſomething of great in her Soul. I tell you this, Madam, to let you know withall, that it was with this charm, rather then with her beauty, that ſhe began to pleaſe the Count. He regarded and obſerved her with care; and ſeeing nothing in all her actions, that was not both extream civil, and a little imperious, he began to love her, and ſo much the more ardently, becauſe he knew that this alliance would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to him; if he ſought after either nobility of race, or commodity of riches, for that being born of a firſt wife of her fathers, ſhe was her only heir. But if <hi>Leonora</hi> was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the eyes of the Count, it may be ſaid, that he ſeemed charming to <hi>Leonora</hi>'s: and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I muſt acknowledg, that I never ſaw him ſo amiable, as in this aſſembly; and if I muſt ſpeak the truth, I do not beleeve that there can ſcarce be found in one only perſon greater qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity then he had. And for agreeable things, it may be well aſſured, that never man was more proper to make himſelf be beloved. His beauty, his good aſpect, his converſation, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, his merry and jovial humor, his addreſs in dancing, in playing on the Lute, in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in riding, and all other things that can give any liking, rendred him incomparable. You may judg after this, whether <hi>Leonora,</hi> who had not her heart engaged otherwhere, could refuſe the affection of a man, in whom ſhe found all that ſhe could wiſh for.</p>
                  <p>This ſpringing affection was ſoon known of every one, but eſpecially of <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> who was advertiſed thereof in a time, when as the Count could not yet tell very well himſelf, whether he loved <hi>Leonora</hi> or no: for the firſt time that he began to conſider her with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60144:173"/> was on the day of that aſſembly, which I have ſpoken to you of already, and where <hi>Jannetin</hi> was preſent, who always regarding the Count as his Competitor had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, and therewith acquainted his Uncle. We have learnt ſince, that <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> no ſooner underſtood of the Counts deſign, but falling into a deep muſe he appeared very ſad and unquiet; and that after his muſing was over, he commanded <hi>Jannetin</hi> to beware of the Counts deſigns: for, ſaid he unto him raiſing up his voyce, it is fit for us to obſerve this young Lion. He is undertaking, and hardy, and if we ſuffer him to gather new forces, by allying with the houſe of <hi>Cibo,</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi>'s riches, he will be capable of enterprizing any thing. <hi>Jannetin</hi> harkened to this diſcourſe as one that was intereſſed therein, and obeying <hi>Andrea</hi>'s order, he obſerved the Count and <hi>Leonora,</hi> and confirmed himſelf in the opinion he had had, both by his own knowledg, and the talk of the Town. Being in no longer doubt then but that the Count was in love with <hi>Leonora,</hi> he advertiſed his Uncle of it, who without further delay commanded him to be the Counts Rival in this ſuit. It would not be enough, ſaid he to <hi>Jannetin,</hi> if we ſhould but break off the Counts marriage; but we muſt make profit of his damage, and pluck the weapons out of his hands, to deſtroy him therewith when we ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of them. You muſt marry <hi>Leonora,</hi> ſhe is fair and amiable; but were ſhe only noble and rich, it would be enough to oblige you to marry her. Think of it then, <hi>Jannetin;</hi> you are young as well as the Count, you have ſpirit and courage, and though it may be you have not ſo good a grace as he, yet you are Nephew to <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> and that is to ſay every thing. Think then of winning <hi>Leonora</hi>'s heart, before it be engaged; but above all, come to no violence; for it imports much, that the adoptive ſon of him, who hath reſtored <hi>Genoua</hi> to her liberty, ſhould not engage him to protect him in ſuch like things. <hi>Jannetin,</hi> who held all his fortune from <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> and who reverenced him more then if he had been his father, promiſed him to forget nothing of all that ſhould lie in his power to ſatisfie him; as indeed, all that care and magnificence could contribute to gallantry, appeared in <hi>Genoua</hi> at that time; and had not your melancholy retained you then at <hi>Monaco,</hi> you would have acknowledged as well as we, that the like had never been ſeen.</p>
                  <p>But whereas the Count could not give place to any body, he no ſooner underſtood <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netin</hi>'s deſign, but he overtopped him in all things. There was nothing but running it the Ring, Turneys, Serenades, Balls, and Feaſts; and in all things if the Count was not more magnificent, yet was he more gentile. His apparel was braver, his horſes were gallanter, his matches better made, his ſerenades better conſorted; <hi>in fine,</hi> he had the advantage in all things. And whereas he loved <hi>Leonora</hi> really, all the teſtimonies he gave her of it, wrought another effect in her heart, then the feigned proteſtations of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> who prevailed not with her at all. Things continued a while in this manner, during the which theſe two Rivals lived civilly enough together, as well by reaſon of the order which <hi>Jannetin</hi> had received for it, as of <hi>Leonora</hi>'s prudence, and the Counts addreſs, who never made ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w of perceiving his Rivals deſigns; though each of them did for his part all that he could to deſtroy his enemy. But at laſt Love and Fortune ceaſed to be blind in this occaſion, and gave the prize to him that beſt deſerved it.</p>
                  <p>The Count had <hi>Leonora</hi>'s permiſſion to demand her of her brothers, under whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhe had been ever ſince the death of her mother; he was their particular friend, ſo that upon the firſt overture which he made to them of it, they received him with incredible joy, and aſſured him (eſpecially <hi>Horatio,</hi> who was more a friend to the Count then <hi>Julio</hi>) provided their ſiſter did not oppoſe his content, that he was certain to be happy. The Count, who was no leſs diſcreet then paſſionate, would not let them know that their conſent was craved to a thing already reſolved, but only told them, that from their mouths he deſired to underſtand <hi>Leonora</hi>'s mind, and from them receive either his good or bad fortune. In the mean time <hi>Jannetin</hi> found that <hi>Leonora</hi> favored the Count to his prejudice, yea and that ſhe was reſolved never to marry any but him. He thought fit to advertiſe <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> of it, who came to know by another, to whom the Counts mother had told it, that he had ſpoken of his marriage to <hi>Horatio,</hi> who had anſwered her favorably, which <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he told <hi>Jannetin,</hi> that he was to conſerve with addreſs the friendſhip of him, whom he could not deſtroy by force; that one of the greateſt effects of prudence was, when one could not vanquiſh his enemies, to conſtrain them to be his friends; and not being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways able to keep them from hurting, one muſt, continued he, tye their hands with a falſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60144:174"/> generoſity, eſpecially when one hath for oppoſite an illuſtrious adverſary, ſuch as the Count is. Go then, <hi>Jannetin,</hi> ſaid he unto him, give up a victory, which you are not able to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and making ſhew as though you come to learn that he hath a deſign for <hi>Leonora,</hi> tell him that you prefer his content before your love, and ſo as he will be your friend, you will yeild him your Miſtreſs with joy: But ſo order the matter, that this may be heard by ſome, to the end that the Count knowing how the world beleeves he is obliged to you, may alſo in conſideration of the world, and for fear of being blamed, live hereafter with you, as if he were your friend. Madam, do not think it ſtrange, that I ſhould know ſo many particulariti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of <hi>Andrea Doria</hi>'s diſcourſes; but be pleaſed to underſtand, that a friend doth not ſo well know what is done in his friends houſe, as mighty enemies do ordinarily know what they project one againſt another: yet was it not equally ſo between the Count and <hi>Andrea Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> it being certain that this laſt knew nothing of the Counts deſigns, what care ſoever he took for it; whereas he on the contrary could conceal none of his from him.</p>
                  <p>But to come again to <hi>Jannetin,</hi> he had been no ſooner inſtructed by his Uncle, but he went home to the Count, who attended with a great deal of impatience the anſwer which <hi>Horatio</hi> was to make him, for it was he who had in charge to give it him, he quitted this muſing humor to receive <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s viſit with his ordinary civility; and according to <hi>Andrea Doria</hi>'s direction, three of <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s friends arrived at the ſame time to be witneſſes of theſe two Rivals converſation. After the firſt complements, <hi>Jannetin</hi> told the Count, that he came not only to render him a viſit, but alſo to render him up his arms, and to demand the grace of him, that he might be one of the captives of his Triumph. I know not, anſwered the Count, what Triumph you mean. It is a Triumph, replyed <hi>Jannetin,</hi> wherein for a Trophy of Arms you ſhall have all the chains of the Lovers of the incomparable <hi>Leonora;</hi> who knowing that you alone merit her, will follow you without regret or envy; at leaſt wiſe I am come hither to aſſure you, that that is my intention: and if I had known that you had born an affection to her, I would have been your Confident, rather then your Rival; yet am I not ſorry, that I have had the commodity to teſtifie unto you, that nothing in the world is ſo dear to me as your friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Count underſtood preſently <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s cunning, yet would make no ſhew of it, but contrarily anſwered him with a great deal of civility and gallantry. I thought, ſaid he unto him, that I had nothing to vanquiſh but the rigors of my Miſtreſs, and if I had beleeved that I had had ſo redoubtable a Rival as you, I had not it may be undertaken to ſerve her: But ſince you are ſo obliging, as to content your ſelf with meriting her, without pretending to her poſſeſſion, I am raviſhed to know that you have judged her worthy of your eſteem; and to underſtand that I ſhall have nothing more then her cruelty to ſurmount; ſince if you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſerving her, and that ſhe had been juſt, I ſhould in your triumph have held the place, which you demand in mine; and which I do not grant you, ſeeing he that yeilds up a victory cannot be ſaid to have been overcome. <hi>Jannetin,</hi> hearing the Count ſpeak in this ſort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that his cunning had ſucceeded, and took that for a teſtimony of friendſhip and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was but an addreſs of his wit; and that not having been able to vanquiſh him in love, he had at leaſt ſurmounted him in ſubtlety, and was arrived at the end he had propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himſelf. But the Count was too clear ſighted to be deceived ſo eaſily; and whereas the moſt dextrous guile is that which perſwades our enemies that they have beguiled us, though indeed we are not; the Count ſaid ſo many obliging things to <hi>Jannetin,</hi> as he made no doubt at all, but that he had abuſed his enemy; and that from thence-forward he would count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf effectively his obliged: nevertheleſs it proved not ſo, as you will underſtand by the ſequel of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Horatio</hi> came to the Count, and having at firſt embraced him in naming him brother, he abſolutely aſſured him of <hi>Leonora</hi>'s conſent. But not to ſtand relating to you the rejoycings of a time, whoſe felicity is ſo far from that which we have paſt ſince, I will only tell you, that a little while after the nuptials of the Count and <hi>Leonora</hi> were celebrated. You were invited, but you would not quit your ſolitude to come and ſee the magnificences of that feaſt. <hi>Jannetin</hi> was the forwardeſt of all the City, to teſtifie the joy he was in for that of the Count, who afterwards ſerved him in his ſuit to her whom he married; and lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with him, as if he had been one of his deareſt friends, albeit in his heart he had quite contrary thoughts.</p>

                  <p>The Counts Mother was raviſhed with her ſons marriage; <hi>Leonora</hi> was infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; <hi>Julio</hi> ſeemed ſatisfied; <hi>Horatio</hi> eſteemed himſelf very happy in it; and <hi>Sophronia</hi> was ſo much the more pleaſed with it, for that being of an age wherein delights, Muſick, and company make up the happineſs of a life, ſhe found all theſe things in the Counts Palace, where ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time the proſperous ſucceſs of his love, had not ſmothered his ambition, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily his eſteem of <hi>Leonora</hi> ſeemed to have augmented it; and <hi>Sophronia,</hi> hath aſſured us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e beleeved it to be juſt, if the counſels of three men, who did but flatter his ambition to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their own, had not confirmed him in that deſign. And truly it muſt be acknowledged, that one hath never heard ſpeak of an enterprize ſo daring in ſo young an age, of a prudence ſo extraordinary for the conduct of ſo dangerous a thing, and of a ſucceſs, equal to his, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had not abandoned him.</p>
                  <p>But, Madam, to make you acknowledg that which I ſay, you are to underſtand, that about two years ago the Count finding himſelf ill for certain days together, went as he uſed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to do into his Cabinet, whither his ambitions mother came to him, for to acquaint him, that <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> who had adopted <hi>Jannetin</hi> for his ſon and ſucceſſor a good while before, had then made him his Lievtenant to the charge he held of <hi>Generaliſſimo:</hi> And all this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, whileſt you are denyed the penſions which the Republique gave <hi>Simbaldo</hi> your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for it was true, that as long as he lived the Senate had aſſigned him a penſion for a mark of honor, which had not been continued to the Court, becauſe he had been ſuſpecte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Doria,</hi> an enemy of the <hi>French,</hi> to be affected to that Nation.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time to return unto my ſubject, the Count had no ſooner heard what his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid unto him, but would have anſwered, when as ſhe ſtaying him told him roundly, think before thou ſpeakeſt of ſaying nothing to me unworthy of thy ſelf, or of me that brought thee into the world, and know that I willl diſavow thee for my ſon, if thou be ſo baſe, as to be contented with thy fortune, and to endure, that they, who do not outgo thee either in birth or merit, ſhould mount into the Throne, and leave thee amongſt the people. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe netled the great heart of the Count, who was but too ſenſible on that part, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed he his reſentment within himſelf, and ſaid no more to his Mother, but that all he could promiſe her was, how he would abſolutely loſe himſelf, or loſe them that oppreſſed him; and that the ſequel or end of his life ſhould not permit her to complain of him. After this ſhe left him, but to confirm him in this dangerous deſign, ſhe had conſulted with thoſe three am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious perſons, of whom I have already ſpoken to you: the firſt was the ſecond Governor which ſhe had given him, named <hi>Vincentio Calcagna,</hi> whoſe maxims were contrary to thoſe of the generous <hi>Penſa;</hi> the ſecond was called <hi>Raphaello Sacco,</hi> a Lawyer of <hi>Savona,</hi> and a cunning and dextrous man, who ſerved him in the government of all his affairs; and the laſt <hi>Baptista Verrin,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who dwelling cloſe by the Counts Palace, had by his ſubmiſſions, and his wit, ſo gained his friendſhip, as he was of all his counſel, and diſpoſed almoſt abſolutely of all his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>It was then by the means of theſe three pernicious Counſellors, that this ambitious woman hoped to carry the Count to the taking of ſome violent reſolution. She had advertiſed them to be ready to go to her ſon, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould come out of his Cabinet: As indeed, ſhe was no ſooner retired, but encountring them, ſhe ſaid unto them; Go, my dear friends, and labor for your ſelves, in laboring for the Count: but above all things remember, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Raphaello Sacco,</hi> to counſel him unto nothing that is violent, which you cannot give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text unto of the publique good, of equity, and of glory: for, continued ſhe, I know the Count ſo well, that if you propound nothing to him but his own conſervation, his utility, the advancement of his fortune, and the undoing of his enemies, you will never vanquiſh him: You muſt ſpur his mind forward with the deſire of honor, and dextrouſly beguile him to keep him from beguiling our hopes. They promiſed her then as much as ſhe could wiſh, and too faithful in this occaſion they kept their word with her; at leaſtwiſe <hi>Raphaello</hi> and <hi>Baptista,</hi> for as for the third, he did that out of fear, which another would have done out of vertue.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60144:175"/>
                  <p>They went then to the <hi>Count's</hi> Cabinet, and to give him no cauſe of ſuſpicion, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to him ſeparately. The firſt that came thither found him in a deep muſe, and never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of him, he continued walking without ſpeaking a word: A little after, the other two arrived, making ſhew as if they had not ſeen one another of all that day. The <hi>Count</hi> in the mean time, not doubting of the Treaſon which they had plotted againſt his vertue, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three men of the world, in whom he moſt confided, come by chance unto him as he believed, at a time when he had need of counſel, could not forbear teſtifying a great deal of joy unto them for it. <hi>What good Angel,</hi> ſaid he unto them, <hi>hath brought you ſo opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to draw me out of the thought I am in at this preſent?</hi> I know not, anſwered <hi>Baptista</hi> cunningly, whether my ſight be pleaſing to you or no, but I know very well that I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is pleaſing to tell you. We are in an age, ſaid the Lawyer, wherein good men have no great cauſe to rejoyce, ſeeing every day the ambition of ſome few carry inſolently away all that which ought to be the recompence of vertue. It may be ſome one will be found, continued <hi>Baptista,</hi> that will make a change in things. But, ſaid the <hi>Count</hi> interrupting him, and addreſſing his ſpeech to <hi>Verrin,</hi> what bad news have you to impart to me? My Lord, anſwered he, it is badder for the Republique, then for you; for <hi>in fine,</hi> to acquaint you that <hi>Jannetin</hi> hath ſtill new honors conferred on him, is to tell you that the power of <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> will paſs into his hands; that his Tyranny will be perpetuated in the perſon of his Nephew; and that we ſhall never have the happineſs to ſee vertue where it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, added <hi>Raphaello Sacco,</hi> that this is the ſence of all good men; and in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the age, it ſeems, ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Count,</hi> that all the world turn their ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> upon you. Your illuſtrious and great birth, accompanyed with ſo many rare qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as are in your perſon, makes all them that love the publique good deſire, that your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were as great as your heart: And for my particular, I would gladly ſee your vertue on a Theater higher then that whereon you are, to the end you might be ſeen of every one: But you are born in ſo unhappy an age, as it ſeems you cannot aſpire to the power of doing good to your Citizens; ſo true it is, that <hi>Andrea</hi> and <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> under the name of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique liberty, have ſolidly eſtabliſhed their Power, or to ſay better, their Tyranny. And in this ſort, one may well aſſure, that the people do ſufficiently chaſtiſe themſelves for the blinde reſolution, which carries them to ſhake off the yoke of a great and excellent Prince, to ſuffer to be impoſed upon them that of two Tyrants, who will be ſo much the more cruel, by how much they are leſs accuſtmed to raign. Their weakneſs, being ſupported by the power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and rendred inſolent by the great number of warlike Veſſels, which we ſee in the Port, will never ſuffer a couragious and reſolute ſpirit. They will beleeve the high vertue of a man of condition too dangerous for their riſing fortune to endure. They will make uſe of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Titles, of Fathers of their Country, and Reſtorers of the liberty, which have been given to <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> for the oppreſſion of the moſt magnanimous, with the pretext of the common good. So that a man of your courage, under this unjuſt dominion, is more ſure of offences, then of life: and if unto this day we have not ſeen ſuch like things, it is becauſe the power of <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> hath not yet attained to its ſupreme greatneſs; and that his moderation hath in ſome ſort retained the imperious humor of <hi>Jannetin.</hi> You know how inſolent he is, how proud, and how inſupportable; think then, if when he ſhall ſee himſelf in an eſtate of being able to do whatſoever he will, and followed by young people, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence him by reaſon of his Charge, whether there be any thing which will not be permitted to his capricious humors? Do you beleeve, that a ſpirit inſatiable as his is, will be reſtrained within the bounds of Reaſon? Do you beleeve, that the deſire or thirſt of raigning, exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by ſo certain a hope, can be extinguiſhed but with the blood of innocents? Do you beleeve, that content with the power, which Fortune and the ſimplicity of our Citizens have given him, he will dye with the ſole name of <hi>Jannetin?</hi> For me, I do not beleeve it. His minde is not ſo moderate, as that he will, or knows how to contain himſelf, upon the point of arriving at his laſt felicity. He attends, as I conceive, the death of <hi>Andrea,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but neer at hand, that he may follow all his inclinations; and to that effect, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the poſſeſsion of the hearts of the Nobles, he goes nouriſhing the people in idleneſs, and the gain of commerce, to the end that this effeminacy depriving them of courage, and being diſaccuſtomed from the exerciſe of Arms, they may not dare to reſiſt him, when he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60144:175"/> ſhall enterprize any thing; and by this means he hides a parricidial deſign under the vail of the publique repoſe and tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>But let us preſuppoſe, that the divine providence, for the preſervation of this Republique, ſhould take him off from this dangerous deſign; the continuance alone of the rank whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he is raiſed, ought to put ſhame and confuſion into the hearts of all the other Citizens, whoſe births are noble. What reaſon is there, that in a free Province, ſo many men of eminent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which yield not unto him, either in nobility, or courage, ſhould live as private perſons, whil'ſt he alone, with the magnificence of a Prince, regards all the reſt as his inferiors, and in ſuch ſort, as they ſeem to depend abſolutely on him? what Law of a well-ordered Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique conſents unto it? what Nation is there, that is not barbarous, which permits it? in what hiſtory of civilized people is any thing ſeen that authorizes it? If hitherto you have not in your particular tryed the inſolency of this haughty humor, it is becauſe there hath no occaſion been offered for it; and you know but too well the thoughts which he hath for you: But henceforward you muſt partake in the publique miſeries; yea I do foretell it with grief, that you will be ſeen, as others, to viſit him, accompany him, ſerve him, and obey him, as our Soveraign: and <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> ſhall reckon up amongſt the Trophies of his inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temerity, that <hi>Giovanni Lodovico,</hi> Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> courted him, reverenced him, and baſely crouched under his dominion. O! how fitter were it, that rouzing up your ſpirit, at the complaints of an oppreſſed people; and taking a reſolution worthy of your Country, of your race, and vertue, you would deliver all your Citizens from this infamy, as well as your ſelf. But it may be that means would be wanting to you for the execution of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; contrarily never thing was more facile.

Your own ſubjects, and the Duke of <hi>Placentia</hi>'s, will defend you from all oppoſition. <hi>In fine,</hi> all things invite you to victory, there is nothing wanting, ſaving onely your Will, not for you to fight, but to triumph. As <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> made uſe of the pretext of liberty to oppreſs his Country, ſo do you make uſe of the pretext of Tyranny to deliver yours. And conſider, that it is abſolutely neceſſary for you, either to command, or to ſerve; to render your ſelf dreadful to others, or to live in continual fear. And ſince Heaven hath given you all that can be deſired for ſo glorious an enterprize, birth, courage, wit, conduct, and means, be ſure to make a profitable uſe thereof; and do not render your ſelf worthy of the ſervitude that is prepared for you, in neglecting ſo fair an occaſion to avoyd it.</p>

                     <hi>Raphaello Sacco,</hi> could not have touched the minde of the <hi>Count</hi> in a more ſenſible part; and this man being born for great matters, was extreamly pleaſed, in that he could perſwade himſelf, by the reaſons alledged unto him, that he might both together deliver his Country, revenge his own injuries, deſtroy his Enemies, content his ambition, and do nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory. The joy he had of it made him reſolve to open his heart to his Confidents; whereupon he acknowledged unto them, that from his tendreſt years, he had felt a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in himſelf to undertake that which had been now propounded unto him; that he had ever been an Enemy to <hi>Jannetin,</hi> though he appeared to be otherwiſe; that his inſolency was inſupportable to him; that having been his Rival in love, he would be the ſame in ambition: Then he recounted unto them, how <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> would have broken off his marriage; and for a concluſion, he declared un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You may indeed with ſmall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſcover your intention, but not arrive at your end. It is ſo much the more grievous, that enterprizes of this nature are not favorably judged of, but by their happy ſucceſs, and that is it which I do not ſee you can obtain. For from what part hope you for great Troops? The King of <hi>France,</hi> on whoſe protection you rely, hath not ſo little to do, in regard of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> but if he had even a minde to make ſome new ſtir in <hi>Italy,</hi> that he could come and ſuccor you with all his forces, which are employed for the ſafety of his frontires. But ſay that he, or any other Prince, ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, could you believe that the Emperor, who for his own intereſt takes that of <hi>Genoua</hi> upon him, would not oppoſe them with forces, if not greater, at leaſt-wiſe equal to thoſe which you ſhould draw to your aſſiſtance? And that being ſo, you would ſee your deſigns but ill aſſured, ſince they would ſtill depend on the loſs or gain of a battel, whoſe event is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doubtful: but on which ſide ſoever the victory doth fall, you are ſtill to follow the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the conqueror, nothing being left you that is certain, but the ſhame of having depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your Country of her Liberty, for to ſubmit it to a ſtranger. But if you turn your eyes to a neerer ſuccor, by thinking to finde it in this City; either I know not the humor, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the <hi>Genoueſſes,</hi> or your hopes are but weakly grounded. Tell me, I pray you, from which ſort of our Citizens do you look for aſſiſtance? Will it be from the Nobles? into whoſe hands <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> hath put the power and government, and who being obliged to him for the authority they enjoy, live in an happy and honorable tranquillity, ſo that no change being able to arrive, which would not be diſadvantageous to them, how would you have them ayd you in an enterprize, which would precipitate them into a more miſerable eſtate then ever they were? Is it poſsible, that meerly to comply with you, they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Country, their liberty, their fortunes, their wives, and their children? Is it poſsible, that they ſhould prefer your friendſhip, before the protection of <hi>Doria,</hi> whom they rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as their common father? No, no, diſabuſe your ſelf from this error; and believe too, that the people will not be more favorable unto you, ſince it is true, that the more hate they bear to the Nobles, the leſs will they truſt you, who being the moſt illuſtrious amongſt them, cannot eaſily perſwade them, that you have no intent to do them hurt. But grant that ſome

                  <p>Again, if you pretend to uſurp the Empire of the Republique, what act can be farther from meriting the good-will of the people? But it may be you will ſay, that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the firſt form of Government, changed by <hi>Doria,</hi> where the popular authority did all things; and that by the declaration thereof the multitude will riſe for your advantage: For my part, I am not of a contrary opinion, but believe, as well as you, that thoſe which are ill ſatisfied will with joy embrace an occaſion of renewing their ancient Tragedies; and ſo much the more ardently, for that they ſhall reap all the profit of it, nothing remaining for you but ſhame and infamy. For, for you to imagine, that the <hi>Fregoſes</hi> and <hi>Adornes,</hi> who ſo many years together have fought one againſt another, to obtain the prime rank in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the popular affairs, will yield it to a man of your birth, is a thing which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be believed without claſhing with Reaſon. They will it may be commend your temerity, and name it valor; they will follow your Colours, as thoſe of their Deliverer; they will rejoyce to ſee the Noble-men put in chains, by the hand of a Noble-man; the bowels of their Country torn out by you; the common reſt troubled by your fury; their Tyranny eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your fault: but a time will come when wholly diſcharging themſelves of the ſedition which you have cauſed, the people will give them the recompence of your travels, the glory of your enterprize, and the triumph of your combats. In what terms will you finde your ſelf then? Which way will you turn your ſelf for ſhame? Deteſted of the Nobles, whom you ſhall have betrayed; deſpiſed of the people, who will deride the means which have cauſed their utility and your ruine; abominable to your Country, as having raviſhed her of her liberty; an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Protector of the Republique; ſuſpected of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who deſires to have an abſolute power at <hi>Genoua;</hi> and hated of all the world, which naturally and reaſonably abhors Treaſons.</p>

Let the pity of your ſelf, of your family, and of your ſubjects, arreſt you. Remember what you owe to your birth, to your reputation, to your Country, and to God: Have compaſſion of the miſeries of your wife; free the mindes of thoſe that love you from ſo juſt a fear; conſider that your youth, accompanyed with ſo many vertues, ought not to be ſo precipitouſly thrown into the hands of Fortune.

This ſpeech could not be heard of the Count without emotion; and ſeeing his deſign combated with ſuch powerful Reaſons, by a man too of whoſe affection he was ſo well aſſured, he ſeemed very unquiet and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which <hi>Baptiſta Verrin,</hi> quickly marking, conceived, that if the Counts reaſon had time to fortifie it ſelf in that which was good, all the enterprize would be in doubt.</p>

I would to God, ſaid he, that the affairs of the Republique were brought to that paſs, as all our Citizens might enjoy their eſtates with tranquility, I ſhould not then be at this day in the neceſſity of wiſhing you an happier condition, ſince as <hi>Vincentio Calcagna</hi> hath well obſerved, there is never a one in <hi>Genoua,</hi> either for Riches, greatneſs of Eſtates, or for illuſtrious Birth, can match you: Neither am I ignorant, that a wiſe man ought not to tempt Fortune during an extream felicity, in regard it cannot change but to his diſadvantage. Howbeit deſtiny, the enemy of your good, hath in ſuch ſort perplexed the <hi>State</hi> of the Republique, as you are enforced to attempt ſomething that is great, or to periſh. <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> who for ſo long a time hath regarded the Empire of <hi>Genoua,</hi> as the term of his deſires and ambition, cannot endure you; and if you do not ſee on his brow, and in his eyes, the marks of the extream hate he bears you; if by his actions you do not diſcover the exceſs of his pride, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of your vertue; the Gallies, which you have bought againſt his will, may render you a ſufficient teſtimony thereof; and perſwade you, that ambition hath its jealouſies as well as love; and that <hi>Jannetin</hi> regarding you as his Rival, your ruine is one of his moſt ardent deſires. His inſolency carries him ſo far, as he will be abſolute Maſter of the Sea, and he will not have any man ſo much as dare to trouble or divide his power with him: How then will you have him endure you for a Competitor in the Government of the Commonwealth, ſince jealouſie, or the deſire of raigning, ſpares neither the blood of brothers, of children, no not of fathers themſelves?</p>
                  <p>A wicked inclination, and an opiniative humor, as <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s is, cannot be changed but by violence: you muſt then, as things ſtand, either retire ſhamefully from <hi>Genoua,</hi> and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning your Gallies to him, declare him victorious, in leaving him Maſter of the field, or rouze up that ſpirit and courage in you, which is to ſurmount him. But if nevertheleſs you be reſolved to decline this peril with infamy, and to preſerve your life, as having received it of grace from the hand of your enemy; I am willing, I conſent to it, and will no longer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; though it be the moſt deplorable eſtate, wherein even the hatred of <hi>Jannetin</hi> can wiſh you. But if your vertue do not deceive my hopes, in making me attend ſome greater and more generous thing from you, I ſhall ſee this raſh man ſurmounted by your valor, and his pride wholly ſubjected to your courage. It is for you then to attempt an enterprize, which is ſo glorious, as even <hi>Jannetin</hi> himſelf will envy you for it. Fortune hath ſet between you two the whole Empire of <hi>Liguria;</hi> and the one cannot vanquiſh the other to mount into the Throne, but by paſſing the Charet of his Triumph over the body of his enemy. He alone ſhall beſt aſſure to himſelf the victory, who can firſt prevent his enemy dextrouſly, by taking from him the means of outſtripping him. It is a neceſſity common to you both, for each of you to think of your conſervation; and he ſhall be the wiſeſt, that with the diligence of a ſpeedy execution ſhall mock at his enemies ſloth, in oppreſſing him without reſiſtance. <hi>In fine,</hi> prepare your ſelf to aſſault, or to be aſſaulted; to lay ambuſhes for your enemy, or to fall into the pit which he hath digged for you; to put him to death, or to ſuffer death your ſelf. It may be this ſpeech will ſeem harſh to the prudent <hi>Calcagna,</hi> but neceſſity, which in the moſt deſperate affairs augmenteth valor and courage, ſerves alſo to juſtifie the violenteſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the cauſe thereof is juſt, and in theſe occaſions it may be named the buckler of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. Let the temerity of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> the baſeneſs of the <hi>Genoueſſes,</hi> and the injuſtice of Fortune, which have forced you to this inevitable miſchief, be accuſed for this enterprize. You do no body injury, when you defend your ſelf, but only follow the ordinary Laws of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It is prudence to divert upon the head of our enemy the tempeſt which would overwhelm
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60144:177"/> us: And if that cannot be done without ſome appearance of evil, the fault ſhall not be yours, but deſtinies, which leaves you no other mean to preſerve your life, but by the death of your adverſary, nor will not let your vertue be able to defend it ſelf without a crime. But what ſay I, a crime I this word is for you, O too prudent <hi>Calcagna;</hi> you have learned it no doubt in the School of the Vulgar, who know not the politick of Conquerors. With ſuch like terms the actions of private perſons are ſpoken of, but not thoſe of the Great: And if your Rule were true, it might be ſaid that all Empires were Robberies, becauſe there is none of them which was not eſtabliſhed by that natural right, which the ſtrong impoſe on the weak.</p>
                  <p>Nature brought men into the world with an equality of all things, and yet left unto Vertue the power of raiſing them, which poſſeſs it, to the glory of raigning over others: From whence it comes, that the moſt part of thoſe, who are Princes or Maſters of the Earth, carry not that title, but becauſe their Predeceſſors, by the addreſs and by force of Arms, uſurped the Empire over their equals. I do not deny but that there are ſome perſons, who as well as <hi>Vincentio</hi> will blame your reſolution, before it be conducted to its end, in regard all hardy and dangerous actions are never commended till they are executed; but as ſoon as the happy ſucceſs of the event ſhall have juſtified and authorized the greatneſs of your enterprize, the blame will be turned into admiration; and that which was called temerity and imprudence, will be termed valor and greatneſs of courage. As long as the firſt of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> was in Arms againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was the cauſe of their conflicts, he had not only <hi>Pompey</hi> for an adverſary, but even all the Nobility were his moſt cruel foes. In the mean time as ſoon as he had defeated his Enemies mighty Army in the plains of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and that this victory had put him in full poſſeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, all the hatred which was born him ceaſed; and he was ſo dearly and ardently beloved of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as this affection could not finiſh with his life, but they puniſhed his death with a memorable revenge. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve then to ſuffer the <hi>Genoueſſes</hi> for a time to call you Tyrant, and do not take this name as a grievous injury, ſeeing it ſhall be the laſt inſolency of their dying liberty. They will accuſtom themſelves afterwards to acknowledg you for their lawful Prince, and as ſuch reverence you. Behold how much I rely on your fortune, in ſpeaking to you of the felicities of your Empire, before you have reſolved to fight for the acquiring of it. But things are diſpoſed in ſuch ſort, as you may ſooner be wanting to your ſelf, then the Empire to your vertue. For if the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties be great, according to <hi>Vincentio</hi>'s opinion, your courage is yet greater. Let us grant him, that the enterprize is dangerous and difficult; in what Hiſtory, ancient or modern, hath it been found, that the way which conducteth to glory is covered with flowers? and that an illuſtrious action hath been executed without pain? All great deſigns have always been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by great perils; and all high places are ever near to <hi>precipices:</hi> A generous man will not for all that let the fear of an uncertain evil, make him a prey to an inevitable ſervitude. Amongſt private perſons it is an effect of prudence to be contained within mediocrity; but in affairs of <hi>State</hi> all reſolutions are to be extream, the reſt being dangerous, eſpecially in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, which begin not to break forth but by their execution. For it being then no longer in our power to retain the thing, we muſt of neceſſity arrive at the end we have propoſed to our ſelves, or fall in the midſt of the courſe, and be utterly loſt. Yet let us not make ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a preſage of our deſigns, but let us forecaſt the misfortunes which may arrive to us, not to torment our ſelves in the expectation of them, but by prudence to take from them the power of hurting us. We are to be guided with precaution, but yet not ſo far, as that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream wiſdom may thereby render us more timorous and vireſolute. You muſt, generous Count, give ſomething to the conduct of Fortune, who having choſen you for the Deliverer of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and Reſtorer of the ancient <hi>Italian</hi> valor, will know well enough how to find out the means to plain all difficulties before you. It is ſhe that calls you to glory; it is ſhe that will conduct you to it; only conſent to your good fortune, and with an open heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crown which fate preſents you with, nor ſharing it with any one. For to what end would it ſerve you to call in the <hi>French</hi> to the ſharing of your glory? whereas that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having loſt their credit in <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as their States, would hurt you more, then they could help you. The example of <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> ſhould keep you ſufficiently from it: He had ſerved them with exceeding affection, and to their great profit, in the mean time you know how he was intreated.</p>
                  <p>And then again, what recompence could the <hi>French</hi> ever give you, that might be worthy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60144:178"/> of your labors? It may be they will leave you Governor in <hi>Genoua,</hi> with the dependances which they uſe to exact of their Subjects; but that would be to render you mercinary in a place, where Nature hath given you part in the Dominion. If any reſiſtance ſhould be made by the Emperor, or by the City it ſelf, againſt your deſigns, with what forces could they come and ſuccor you, being in a Country ſo far diſtant from ours, and ſo taken up with their own affairs. Verily you are to make uſe of your Subjects, of your Friends, and of your Confederates. And why will you not with ſo generous a Troop undertake to ſet this Crown upon your head, which is as worthy of you, as you are worthy of it? When as your power ſhall be eſtabliſhed in <hi>Genoua,</hi> which may be ſaid to be the Key of all <hi>Italy</hi> on the Sea-coaſt, the chiefeſt Kings of Chriſtendom will ſeek for your alliance and amity with care. The envy of your Competitors being ſurmounted, the family of the Counts of <hi>Lavagna</hi> will be in a ſtate, whereunto no perſon in <hi>Genoua</hi> ever yet arrived. It will lie in your hands to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of thoſe enemies that deſpiſed your youth; <hi>Jannetin</hi> himſelf, yea <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> your mortal enemy, ſhall fall ſpight of his teeth at your feet, to crave pardon of you; He ſhall reverence you as his Lord; he ſhall fear you as a Prince; his actions ſhall be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to your pleaſure; your will ſhall rule his deſires; and on you alone ſhall his life or death depend. Let the <hi>French</hi> then keep themſelves in their Kingdom, and from thence only let them hear the fame of your Victories. It is for you alone to ſurmount all the Obſtacl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s which may be oppoſed to your generous deſigns. Undertake it then with a confidence worthy of your birth, and of your courage; merit by this action the triumph which Heaven hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to you. Let all the world learn that you knew how to be the illuſtrious and ſole Artiſan of your fortune. Surpaſs the hopes which I have of you, although they be very great: and to ſay all, aſſure the Empire to your family, and Eternity to your name.</p>

                     <hi>Baptista Verrin</hi> had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but <hi>Raphaello Sacco</hi> affected to <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Vincentio Calcagna</hi> puſhed on by his timidity, by the fear of loſing that repoſe which he had enjoyed all his life time, and by the affection which he bore to the Count, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves once more againſt <hi>Baptiſta.</hi> The firſt would have had nothing undertaken without the ſuccor of the <hi>French;</hi> and the other would have had nothing undertaken at all. But <hi>Baptista</hi> for his own intereſt would be ſure not to yield in this occaſion: He ſaw, that as long as the Government was in the hands of the Nobility, he ſhould never pretend to have any part in the ſway thereof. And then again, he had brought his affairs into ſo ſtrange a diſorder, by the debts which he had run into, as judging that he could hardly conceal his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery longer, if the tranquility of the Republique ſhould laſt any time, he was deſirous to ſteal it from the eyes of the world by a univerſal confuſion. He conſidered alſo, that if the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize were proſperous, he ſhould raiſe his fortune to an high pitch; that it contrarily the ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of it ſhould be infortnate, his ruine being accompanied with that of others, and dying in his endeavoring the execution of a great deſign, it would be ſome comfort to him to think that the infamy of his name would paſs unto poſterity; ſo true it is, that the ambition of men is ſo unreaſonable, as to make them oftentimes to put no difference between good and bad fame, provided it be great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baptiſta</hi> then oppoſed himſelf with a great deal of vehemency againſt their Reaſons that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned his, and told the Count, that it was a thing unworthy of a noble Soul, to let himſelf be vanquiſhed by fear, or to ſay better, by <hi>Chimera</hi>'s. He repreſented unto him, that the Gariſon of <hi>Genoua</hi> conſiſted of no more then two hundred Soldiers; that <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies, though many in number, would be unprofitable for his defence, ſo as the time of execution were choſen, when as they were diſarmed, at their return from ſcouring the Seas, which they uſually did every year; that <hi>Andrea</hi> and <hi>Jannetin,</hi> far from all ſuſpicion, lived without any particular Guard, and in a confidence which would be very commodious to them; that it would be eaſie for him to draw into <hi>Genoua</hi> a good number of ſelected men, and taken out of the Lands of his obedience, who on a ſudden ſhould go and ſeize upon <hi>Doria</hi> in his own Palace; and that at the very ſame time it would be facile to render himſelf Maſter of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; that the hatred of the people againſt the Nobles would make an end of the reſt of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and give it an happy ſucceſs. He offered for his own particular to get the Citizens to riſe in favor of this deſign; aſſuring him, that by his means they were wholly diſpoſed already to rebellion. With ſuch like Reaſons, which <hi>Verrin</hi> amplified with a great deal of addreſs, he became Maſter of the Counts mind, who plainly teſtified that he determined, either to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60144:178"/> periſh, or to raign. And after he had made known, that nothing could alter his reſolution, he ſaid unto <hi>Raphaello Sacco,</hi> who had perſwaded him to the buſineſs under the pretext of the publique good, Heaven is my witneſs, that if I did not beleeve I ſhould make my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try more happy under my Command, then it is under the Tyranny of them that oppreſs it, I would chuſe rather to dye, then to attempt that which I am going to undertake.</p>
                  <p>This ſpeech ended, they all reſolved with one accord, that ſince the Government could not be changed without the death of <hi>Andrea</hi> and <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> they were chiefly to think of giving ſuch order to the matter, as the end of their lives ſhould be the beginning of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof. This Conſpiracy being made, the Count went out of his Cabinet, with a marvelous tranquillity of ſpirit, and we were all the evening with him, talking of Muſick and Painting, as if he had hid nothing elſe of importance in his thought. As for his Counſellors, they told her who had employed them, that ſhe was to attend great matters from her ſon, without particularizing any thing unto her, for fear leſt ſhe ſhould diſcover them. In the mean time, the Count, having certain days after taken great care for the Gallies, which he had bought not long before, uſed to go oftentimes to the places belonging to him; where with an admirable Providence he furniſhed his Subjects with Arms, and made them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them, upon pretext of being in ſome fear of the Duke of <hi>Placentia,</hi> whoſe neighbor he was; but indeed, it was to render them capable of ſerving him in his deſign.</p>
                  <p>The end of Autumn being come, he return d to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and applyed all his care to gain the good-will of all the young men, of thoſe families newly ennobl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas he had a quick and pleaſing wit, and a ſupple and charming humor, he won their affection in ſo high a manner, as he was their Maſter, rather then their friend. When as he knew that he might begin to confide in them, and that their wills de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended abſolutely on his, he fell to jeering, as occaſion ſerved, at the Government of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which he termed the Tyranny of the Nobles. Sometimes he teſtified with interrupted ſpeeches that he ſuffered in the miſeries of the popular families; ſometimes he ſeemed to tell them that the matter was not paſt remedy, and that they might abaſe the pride of the Nobles, if their hearts did not fail them; ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>times alſo with a bitter ſcoff he exhorted them to ſervitude; yet ſtill leaving them a ſting behind in their minds by his doubtful and uncertain words. And above all things, he aggravated the injuſtice of the Government, when by chance any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fell out, that diſpleaſed the popular families. But if he were agreeable to them, he had rendred himſelf no leſs pleaſing to the common people, by ſuch means as he had c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelf alſo in fencing, and riding of the great horſe, and that with ſo gallant a grace, and ſo great an addreſs, as they that ſaw him could not chuſe but love a man, who gave them ſo much delight.</p>
                  <p>But whereas liberality is the ſtrongeſt chain, wherewith the people may be captivated, he met with no occaſion of demonſtrating his unto them, but he teſtified it with a magnificence paſt compare. Yet would not our prudent Conſpirator caſt himſelf ſo abſolutely into the hands of the people, as to miniſter any jealouſie thereby to the Nobles; but he uſed ſo juſt a temper in a conjuncture, where mediocrity was ſo hard to be obſerved, that the good-will of the one did not make him loſe the friendſhip of the others. And to that effect, though <hi>Jannetin</hi> was become very inſolent, ſince <hi>Caeſar</hi> had admitted him for <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> after the death of <hi>Andrea;</hi> though he would be no longer followed by young men but for intereſt; though he would be no longer ſerved but for fear; though his arrogance had even carried him to offer ſome ill uſage to the Count; yet began he not only to go oftner to <hi>Andrea</hi> then he was wont, and to ſhew a more particular reverence to him, but ſhutting up alſo in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And becauſe that in times paſt the love of <hi>Leonora</hi> had put them at odds with one another, he uſed great care to take from him the memory thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:60144:179"/>
                  <p>In the mean time, he had treated ſecretly with the Duke of <hi>Placentia,</hi> who had promiſed him two thouſand Foot, to joyn with two thouſand others, which he had pick'd forth out of all his ſubjects, for the ſervice of his enterprize when time ſhould ſerve. He had alſo cauſed one of his Gallies to come to <hi>Genoua</hi> under pretext that he meant to ſend her forth to ſcour the Seas all along the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> Howbeit during all this we obſerved as a moſt extraordinary thing in him, that he was as merry as he uſed to be, delighted as much in our company, and ſeemed to have no other greater thought, then of being agreeable to his friends.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Baptista,</hi> cunning and undertaking as he was, remained not idle; for in a very ſhort time he had gained a great number of perſons, who promiſed to follow and ſerve him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in a ſecret deſign which he ſaid he had. With theſe preparations, they believed that they had layd foundations ſolid enough for the execution of their intentions; and being aſſembled together to take their laſt reſolution, the advice of <hi>Baptiſta Verrin</hi> was, that whereas there was a ceremony to be celebrated for the performance whereof every one would reſort unto the Church, he would have them begin the executing of the buſineſs in that place, offering to give <hi>Jannetin</hi> the firſt ſtab. But the <hi>Count's</hi> piety being unable to conſent to this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he made a ſtep or two back, crying out, He would never endure that the beginning of his enterprize ſhould be a profanation and a ſacriledg. <hi>Raphaello Sacco</hi> added thereunto, that the matter likewiſe would even be as uncertain, as it was execrable; becauſe <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> might excuſe himſelf upon the incommodity of his age, and ſo not come, but ſend <hi>Philippo Doria</hi> his Kinſman in his ſtead. To this <hi>Verrin</hi> anſwered again, that if they thought it fit he would go, whil'ſt they were executing the buſineſs, to <hi>Andrea</hi>'s Palace, and under colour of viſiting him as he was wont to do, he would ſtrike him to the heart with his Poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard. But the <hi>Count</hi> being very angry with him for it, he gave this over, and propounded another expedient worthy of his wit: He told the <hi>Count,</hi> that <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s ſiſter being ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after to marry with <hi>Julio Cibo, Leonora</hi>'s brother, he would have him deſire them to ſup at his houſe; and to render the feaſt the more magnificent, he ſhould alſo invite <hi>Andrea Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Jannetin,</hi> together with a great number of Ladies, and all ſuch amongſt the Nobles, whom they might judg were moſt to be feared for the execution of their deſign; That things being thus, it would be eaſie for them whom they had hid for that purpoſe to kill them; that preſently thereupon the <hi>Count,</hi> followed by his friends, ſhould go through all the ſtreets of <hi>Genoua,</hi> ſounding out the ſweet name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and acquainting the people that their chains were broken; That in this Tumult the Palace was to be ſeized upon and ſecured; that in the mean time he would poſſeſs the people with the <hi>Count's</hi> generous deſigns, concealing from them with addreſs that which he had of abſolutely raigning; and letting them know the neceſsity of reforming the Government, or to ſay better, the cruel Tyranny of the Nobles, for ſo it was that he ſpake; That for this effect he would crown him Duke of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and cauſe them whom he had gained to take the oath of allegiance unto him; That if any one, either in woord or deed, ſhould contradict them, he ſhould be killed upon the place.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count</hi> found this plot indifferently well contrived, but yet he felt an extream repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy in reſolving to violate the law of hoſpitality, in killing men in his houſe, whom he had intreated thither; but being perſwaded that he ſhould not meet with a better mean to arrive to his end, he reſolved for it: And to that purpoſe, he commanded, that the Soldiers, which he had choſen from amongſt his Subjects, ſhould come one by one into <hi>Genoua;</hi> And on the other ſide he ſollicited the Duke of <hi>Placentia</hi> to ſend him the ſuccor which he had promiſed him. All theſe diſpatches could not be ſo ſecretly made, eſpecially having to do with a levy of men of war, but that <hi>Don Fernando de Gonzagua,</hi> who had ſucceeded to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Guaſt,</hi> and commanded at that time in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> was advertiſed thereof. For whereas he was vigilant for the ſecurity of the <hi>State,</hi> which had been entruſted to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he had carefully ſet ſpies to obſerve the leaſt motions of the neighboring Provinces, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Princes that were ſuſpected to him; ſo that he was ſoon informed by men, that were as dextrous as faithful, whom he had employed for that effect, that the Duke of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia</hi> had levyed in his <hi>State</hi> two thouſand Soldiers with extraordinary haſte for the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Lavagna;</hi> and conjecturing by the ſilence and ſecrecy, which was uſed in this affair, that there was ſome great deſign a plotting, he ſent with all ſpeed to <hi>Genoua,</hi> to adviſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:60144:179"/> and <hi>Don Gomes Suarez,</hi> the Emperors Embaſſador there, to ſtand upon their guard, becauſe the young <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Lavagna</hi> was conſpiring ſome great matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Andrea</hi> received this advice, without grounding any thing thereupon; for he was ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the <hi>Count's</hi> affection to him, and ſo powerfully aſſured, by the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which he always ſaw in his face, that he had no bad deſign in hand, as this diſcourſe made no kind of impreſſion in his mind; and to confirm him in his incredulity, the <hi>Count</hi> entred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently into <hi>Andrea</hi>'s chamber, when as the Embaſſador and he were ſpeaking of this affair; but he appeared with ſo clear a countenance, and talked to them with ſo much judgment, and liberty of ſpirit, that <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> charmed with his converſation, and perſwaded of his innocency, approached to the Embaſſador, and ſaid to him ſoftly in his ear, as we have learn'd ſince, <hi>Judg you your ſelf, whether this Princely look, this both modeſt and confident carriage, this noble and quiet ſoul, and this liberty of ſpirit, can be capable of ſo horrible a conspiracy?</hi> The Embaſſador not able to gainſay <hi>Andrea</hi>'s Opinion, made a ſign to him that he was of his minde. And albeit that two days after <hi>Doria</hi> had a ſecond advertiſement, yet the <hi>Count's</hi> addreſs was ſo great, as his ſight alone deſtroyed whatſoever was ſaid againſt him. And ſo wonderful was his conduct, that <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> above fourſcore years of age, and held for one of the greateſt politicians of his time, was beguiled by a man of two and twenty.</p>
                  <p>The generous <hi>Panſa,</hi> who had been of none of the <hi>Count's</hi> counſels, was without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon more adviſed. For whereas he joyned affection to prudence, it was the more eaſie for him to ſuſpect ſomething of the truth. He had exactly obſerved all the <hi>Count's</hi> actions, ever ſince he had bought the Gallies of the Duke of <hi>Placentia;</hi> and carefully examining all that he had ſeen or heard in divers occaſions, he found that he had cauſe to fear leſt the <hi>Count</hi> had ſome dangerous deſign a foot. He ſaw how he, who was accuſtomed to communicate the moſt important affairs of his houſe to him, talked no longer with him but of indifferent things; that he was often in a retired and private converſation with <hi>Baptista Verrin,</hi> and having followed him ſometimes when as he withdrew himſelf into his Cabinet, he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be muſing and melancholique: For though the <hi>Count</hi> ſeemed to be merry, when as he might be ſeen of any body, and by that artifice admirably covered the deſigns which he had in his heart, yet was he no ſooner retired in private, but he became quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other then what he had been ſeen abroad, which <hi>Panſa</hi> alone had marked, for he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf from <hi>Leonora,</hi> as well as from others. That which kept the <hi>Count</hi> from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his deſign to <hi>Panſa,</hi> was his knowledg of the affection and exceeding prudence of the man, ſo that he was aſſured he would have oppoſed his deſign, or at leaſt-wiſe have counſelled him not to have undertaken it ſo precipitouſly; and would have had him ſeek for more ſecurity in an enterprize, where none had ever been.</p>
                  <p>At length, one day when as the <hi>Count</hi> returned to his Palace more melancholique then he uſed to be, carrying in his face ſome marks of an extraordinary unquietneſs, and with ſuch a paleneſs, as amazement many times paints on the forehead of thoſe, which are upon the point of executing ſome great deſign, whoſe event is but ill-aſſured; the generous <hi>Panſa</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to his Cabinet, and reſolved to tell him his ſuſpicions, for fear leſt if he ſhould longer defer to do it, there would be no time left for the remedying of the evil whereof he was afraid. After he had ſhut the door, then he addreſſed his ſpeech to the <hi>Count,</hi> who leaning on a Table, heard him with a great deal of unquietneſs. I know very well, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, that one merits to be as much blamed, for enquiring into the ſecrets of another, as one ought to be eſteemed, for fidelity in concealing them, when they are entruſted unto us; wherefore mine being known by ſo many proofs which I have rendered unto you of it, I have beleeved, that it was for you to diſcover your mindes unto me, and for me not to do any thing that might diſpleaſe you. But now that the trouble of your eyes doth juſtifie my ſuſpicions, and redouble my unquietneſs, I learn to fear by the fear which I diſcern in your face, that doubtleſs betrays your thoughts; Yes, my dear Maſter, I fear, and am not able to tell you what it is I fear; howb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it I know very well that it is an effect of the love I bear you, and an exceſs of my fidelity, which puts me into doubt; but I know alſo, that my fear is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out probability. For how can I be perſwaded that that which you are premeditating is glorious and honorable, if it hath the power to trouble the tranquillity of your Soul? Beleeve me, the execution of the matter you are thinking of, can be neither very aſſured, nor very facile,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60144:180"/> ſince the onely imagination thereof diſquiets you. Let this fatal preſage arreſt you, and know, that all the enterprizes which are commenced with this repugnancy and penſiveneſs, whereof I behold the marks in your face, have never or ſeldom any proſperous ſucceſs. Make profit then of the interior advertiſements, which Heaven ſends you. I do not preſs you to tell me the ſecret, which you will not have me to know, though I may preſume to ask of you, why you retain me about you, if my faith be ſuſpected to you, and that you no longer judg me worthy of your confidence? But onely tell me, what object and what end can the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe men have, who always leave you ſo ſad and unquiet, as I never ſaw you ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Alaſs! how do I fear, leſt theſe ſecret counſels, which you hold ſo often with theſe violent perſons, and whoſe inclinations are not very ſincere, ſhould by their addreſs and cunning draw you out of the way of vertue! Suffer me, my dear Maſter, to diſcover the diſeaſe that I may cure it. They, from whom my ſuſpicions ariſe, are not of ſuch commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manners, or of ſo exemplary a piety, as I may beleeve they give you counſels, which do not claſh either with Vertue, or with Religion. It may be they abuſe your little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and knowing you generous they propound unto you actions, which in appearance are great and glorious, but which in effect are raſh and vain. Open your eyes then, O noble <hi>Count,</hi> and think that an inconſiderate man may make you fall into a precipice, out of which the prudence of all the wiſeſt in the world cannot draw you. It is eaſie enough to ſet a Palace on fire, but it is not ſo eaſie to quench it: Take heed leſt they that counſel you do not make uſe of you, to arrive at the end which they propoſe unto themſelves; and that your undoing do not ſerve for the benefit of them which deceive you. It is rare to meet with men, who counſel that which is good, becauſe it is good, without regard to their intereſt; and yet it is by this experience, that we are to be ſecured of them. Examine then ſeriouſly, whether they, which counſel you, cannot become greater or richer by that they would have you undertake. And to tell you all that I think in this occaſion, I cannot be perſwaded, that they, which ſpend their lives amongſt crimes, are capable of perſwading vertue unto others. For though there be great difference between deeds and words, the moſt important part of perſwaſion conſiſts in example rather then in diſcourſe; and commonly the mouth and the hand act alike. What would theſe men have of you? To what innovation would they carry you? The eſtate of your affairs are at ſuch a point, as they have no need of change; there can no mutation arrive unto you, but will be to your diſadvantage. Envy hath a long time ſought to faſten on you, and will you let her take hold on you by the diſorder whereunto they are carrying you? For you are not ignorant, how there is a great number of perſons, who are inferior to you, both in Nobility, Eſtate, and Vertue, which endevor to traduce you. I know that hope is ſweet unto young people, eſpecially to them which can ſuſtain it with the greatneſs of their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but I know withall that nothing is more ſlippery then proſperity: Beware then leſt the hope of an incertain thing do not make you loſe an aſſured good. They which counſel you have nothing to loſe, nor nothing to hazard, whether their means or their reputation be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and therefore it is, that theſe kinde of men wiſh for revolts, ſeditions, tumults, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, becauſe it is the cuſtom of ſuch like perſons to enrich themſelves with other mens loſſes, and to find their particular reſt in a general confuſion. <hi>In fine,</hi> they which are not very high, fear not falling; but you are to deal otherwiſe: For you are not onely obliged to conſerve the bleſſings, which Heaven hath committed to you, as it were in truſt, but you are alſo obliged out of a ſenſe of honor to give occaſion unto fame, by the generoſity of your actions, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that you are the worthy ſucceſſor of ſo many great men which have preceded you.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count</hi> heard the generous <hi>Panſa</hi> with a great deal of impatience; he told him for all that in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s birth; and having embraced him very tenderly, he left him, after he had conjured him not to ſay any thing to <hi>Leonora</hi> of his unquietneſs. In the mean time the <hi>Count</hi> and his Confederates impatiently attended the day of that fatal feaſt, which was to be the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> for the executing of their deſign. But they were conſtrained to haſten the buſineſs, becauſe <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> having been taken with a fit of the gout, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with a feaver, was not in caſe to keep his promiſe for being there: and <hi>Jannetin</hi> being to part from <hi>Genoua</hi> about a very preſſing affair, the <hi>Count</hi> did thereupon judg, that it would be ſuperfluous for him, to attend the day of the feaſt, ſince the two principal ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which were to be offered, would not be preſent there. And conſidering further that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60144:180"/> the greateſt obſtacle of Conſpirators is always retardment, they reſolved on the ſecond of <hi>January</hi> at night for the execution of their deſign. And to that effect the <hi>Count</hi> began to publiſh that he had a determination to ſend one of his Gallies againſt the Pirates; for that the Pope having allowed him entertainment but for three of them, he would have the other bring him in wherewithall to defray the charge he was at with her. Upon this pretext, and by this artifice, he cauſed a great part of the Soldiers, which had been ſent him from <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia</hi> to enter into <hi>Genoua;</hi> ſaying, that out of them he would make choyce of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ableſt men. And leſt the number of thoſe which came from his Lands, who were far more then were needful for a Gally, ſhould give any ſuſpicion, he made a great many of them to be led in chained, as Malefactors deſtined to the Oar; and cauſed the reſt to enter in one after another through ſeveral gates, after they were well furniſhed with Arms. And the better to beguile <hi>Jannetin,</hi> he entruſted him with the deſign which he ſaid he had for the ſending of his Gally to ſcour the Seas, deſiring him ſo to deal with <hi>Andrea,</hi> as he might give no impediment unto it; fearing (ſaid he) leſt the obligation wherein the Republique ſtood engaged to <hi>Soliman</hi> by the means of <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> ſhould keep <hi>Andrea</hi> from permitting it. <hi>Jannetin</hi> promiſed him all that he deſired, and kept his word with him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the ſecond of <hi>January</hi> being arrived, which preceded that dreadful night, the Count cauſed certain Soldiers of the Gariſon to come to his Palace, whereof ſome were his Subjects, and the reſt ſuch as had been placed there by him, and having left them under the Command of one of the Conſpirators, he went and paſt away the reſt of the day till even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> where he had never been ſeen more merry, or more pleaſant. He intreated <hi>Jannetin</hi> again, who was there preſent, to give order at the Port, that his Gally; which was that night to ſet ſail towards the Archipelague, might not be ſtayed. He adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him alſo, that he would not be troubled, if he heard any noiſe, or any Ordnance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; for, as you know better then I, ſaid he unto him, they always ſhoot off ſome for the Ceremony of parting, and theſe things never paſs without ſome ſtir. At his coming from thence the <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs and I met him; but it had been hard for us to foreſee what the Count had in his thought; for he talked to us of nothing but of matches of ſport and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light for the enſuing days; Howbeit he gave us dextrouſly to underſtand, that he ſhould be buſie this evening in ſetting forth his Gally, for fear leſt we ſhould go home with him, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nevertheleſs very ſorry at it, and telling us that <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Sophronia</hi> would not be friends with him for it. After we were parted from him, he went to his Palace, which, as you know, was in that part of <hi>Genoua,</hi> called <hi>Carignan,</hi> and which ſeems to be ſevered from all the reſt of the City, and to command it, as well for its advantageous ſcituation, as for its magnificence. You know alſo, that this Palace, being built upon a little hill, touched the walls of the City almoſt on every ſide; The Sea was in the face of the building, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it had for proſpect the pleaſant Valley of <hi>Biſagno.</hi> I put you in mind of theſe things, that you may comprehend, how this Palace, being as it were an Iſland, was very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſcituated for the Counts enterprize; having no nearer a neighbor then <hi>Baptiſta,</hi> who being of the Conſpiracy was not to be feared. <hi>In fine,</hi> being returned home, he drew thither about the beginning of the night, a great many of armed men, of thoſe which he had cauſed to enter ſecretly into the City, and of thoſe which he had ſuborned even in <hi>Genoua</hi> it ſelf. He placed them for the Guard of the Gates of his Palace, whom he held to be the moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous and faithful; with order to leave the entrance thereinto free to every one, but to let no body paſs out of them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time one of the Captains of the Gariſon, going to ſet Sentinels, perceived that ſome of the Soldiers were miſſing, and enquired of his Lievtenant whither they were gone; whereupon ſome of their fellows anſwering that they were gone to <hi>Carignan</hi> with the Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> it made him ſuſpect ſomething; ſo that he went inſtantly and gave notice thereof to the Senators that were at the Palace, and to <hi>Andrea Doria;</hi> and then it was that the Counts diſſimulation wrought the greateſt effect, and began to produce that which he had expected from it. <hi>Jannetin</hi> hearing this advertiſement, told him, that his fidelity was to be commended, although this advice had no ground for them to fear any thing. For whereas he was prepoſſeſt by the Counts addreſs, who had demanded permiſſion of him for the parting away of a Gally this night to ſcour the Seas towards the Levant, he aſſured them that all theſe Soldiers, which were gone to him, being of his own or the Duke of <hi>Placentia</hi>'s Subjects,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60144:181"/> were deſtined to that purpoſe; and that thoſe, which were ſaid to be at <hi>Carignan,</hi> were gone thither to take their farewell of ſome of their friends. With ſuch like diſcourſes, <hi>Jannetin</hi> made the reſt give over their ſuſpicions, and he himſelf ſerved the deſign of his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>This while the Count, after he had given order for all things neceſſary at home, went to two or three of thoſe aſſemblies, which are made a nights in the houſes of perſons of quality in <hi>Genona,</hi> where the ſmall time that he ſtayed there, he left a new admiration of his wit. He was magnificently apparelled that day, and redoubling alſo his ordinary civility and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, he went not out of any of thoſe companies without augmenting the affection which they already bore unto him. But at laſt he went to the houſe of one, named <hi>Aſſereto,</hi> where he found three and twenty young Gentleman of the Popular order, whom the cunning of <hi>Baptiſta Verrin</hi> had drawn thither. The Count careſſed them exceedingly, and talking with them of divers things, and ſupper time being near, he deſired them to go home and eat with him. He told them, that it was too fair an evening to part ſo ſoon; that the night was too light, and the Moon too clear, for them to excuſe themſelves upon the ſeaſon; and briefly, he intreated them with ſo good a grace, as they went along with him. The Count led them to a back room, willing the diſcreet <hi>Panſa</hi> to go and entertain his wife, unto whom he would come ere it were long, becauſe, ſaid he ſmiling, our deſign will not brook the preſence of Ladies. At firſt theſe young Gentlemen beleeved, that it was to treat them with the more liberty he did ſo, and ſo went on with him. In the mean time <hi>Baptiſta Verrin</hi> went dextrouſly to ſee if he could diſcover any thing about the Palace, or at <hi>Doria's,</hi> that might make him think they were ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>Things being in theſe terms, the Count entred into another chamber, after he had told them, that he would come to them again preſently, as indeed he ſtayd not long before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. But they were mightily ſurprized, when as they ſaw him enter compleatly armed, and followed by two hundred Soldiers, with Partiſans or Muſquets, which ranged themſelves round about him; He had his Viſer up, and his Sword in his hand; and beginning then to let the hatred and choller break forth, which he had for ſo long a time kept concealed in his heart, his face was all on fire, and fierceneſs and fury appeared in his eyes. He approached to a Table, and leaning on it with his left hand, he continued a while without ſaying any thing; then ſuddenly giving a great bounce on it, he ſaid with an imperious tone, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate voyce, It is done, I am reſolved, O conragious and illuſtrious friends! a ſpirit touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any generoſity can no longer ſuffer it; the inſolency of them that would oppreſs us hath incenſed my courage, and wearied my patience. My imagination preſents unto me a ſpectacle, too horrible and too deadly, in making me ſee our Citizens tyrannized, and the ſubverſion of our Country indubitable, for me not to oppoſe my ſelf to a miſchief, which fear, or to ſay better, Reaſon, makes me ſee ſo nigh at hand. If the evils, wherewith the Republique is mortally tainted, could hope for remedies from time, I would endure, as others do, a retardment, which might be profitable to the publique good; but ſince we are arrived at the laſt period of our miſery, and that we ſee our ſelves quite ready to be ruined, we muſt of neceſſity go and encounter that which is to overwhelm us: and if it be poſſible, not only ſuſtain, but overthrow it. How great ſoever the peril is, it loſes much of its force, when it is couragiouſly affronted; whereas contrarily, it encreaſes and becomes inevitable when it is attended with patience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> weary of that idle felicity which follows him, dreams of nothing but of contenting his ambition; and ſeeing his pernicious deſigns, ſo near to be executed, his whole thought is beſtowed in contriving my death, and your ſervitude. It was not enough for this ambitious man to ſee the people of <hi>Genoua</hi> diſpoiled of the Empire of <hi>Liguria,</hi> and ſubmited to be the object of the contempt of the Nobles, but he muſt enterprize alſo to render himſelf tyrannically Soveraign of you: yea, more barbarous then Strangers have been unto us, ſo great a pride is there ſeen in his heart, as cannot be vanquiſhed by patience, nor avoyded by humility. And to ſecure himſelf of you, he holds you beſieged on the Sea-ſide with twenty Gallies, which in the midſt of an apparant peace are in the Port, more for your ruine then for your ſafety. We ſee him always going through the City, invironed with Nobles, who by the favor of <hi>Andrea,</hi> having uſurped the Commands which appertained unto you, render unto <hi>Jannetin,</hi> for a recompence of your infamy, an honor unworthy both of them and of him.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60144:181"/> But that which touches me further, is, that I certainly know how under the authority of a Prince he prepares an heavy yoke for the publique liberty. And becauſe I have without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my birth embraced your cauſe, not ſo much for the intereſt of your order, as for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Reaſon, and ſatisfying of my duty; becauſe, I ſay, I have never conſented to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contempt, which the Nobles have uſed towards all them that are not of their body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have eſteemed of vertue whereſoever I have met with it; becauſe I have always taken part with Equity, without conſidering that their intereſts were in ſome ſort mine; they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon my life, and believe that they cannot put you into chains, unleſs they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What do we mean then, O my companions, by our ſloth and our cowardiſe? Will we be always the Spectators of our own miſery? For what enterprize ſhall we reſerve our courage, if in the general deſolation of our Country we abandon our ſelves? It is no time for us longer to complain of our Enemies, but to revenge our ſelves of them. Let us leave the uſe of tears to our wives, and if we be worthy the name of men, which we bear, let us employ our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, our force, and our addreſs, in deſtroying our Tyrants. We have too much already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured their inſolency, which doubtleſs carries them to believe, that our patience is an effect of our faint-heartedneſs. They who leave crimes unpuniſhed, are guilty of thoſe, which the exceſs of their goodneſs doth make their oppreſſors commit afterwards; who ordinarily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their violences, when as they ſee they are diſſembled. What do we further expect, O ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Citizens? May it be, to have the Government, and all kind of Authority in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique to be utterly loſt? May it be, that you will have the heart to place <hi>Jannetin</hi> in the Throne? To ſee the Miniſters of his fury go and take your goods out of your houſes, ruine your families, attempt upon your lives, diſhonor your wives, and commit thoſe wickedneſſes, which may juſtly be attended from a Tyranny, that is born for the ruine of the Country, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the publique diſſention, increaſed by the miſeries of the Citizens, and eſtabliſhed by the death of ſo many good men? Are our courages ſo baſe, and ſo low brought? Have our ſwords ſo little edg, as we cannot cut off the infamous life of him, who makes a glory of our ſhame, who triumphs over our misfortunes, and feeds on our miſeries? Shall we not pluck out of <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s body that cowardly heart, which hath contrived ſo many Treaſons, and which may be termed the ſcource of all our miſchiefs? Shall we ſuffer a ſimple Citizen to be our Tyrant, let him trample us under his feet, and ſubjecting us unto him as his Slaves, diſpoſe of our lives and deaths as he pleaſeth? For me, I profeſs freely unto you, that I hold it more glorious to buy liberty with a great peril, then to ſweeten ſervitude with idleneſs and patience. And as I take it for a glory, that our Enemies have a deſign to add the loſs of my life unto that of the Republique, ſo do I conſecrate my life with joy for the liberty of my Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But without animating you by the hope of that is to come, I know very well, ſo as you will call to mind the outrages of the Nobles, and the inſolency of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> I know very well, I ſay, that the deſire of revenge being rouzed up in your Souls, you will come to fight with ſo much heart, as our Enemies ſhall to their damage admire the valor of thoſe whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; and you on the contrary ſhall know by your own experience, whether they have as much force in warlike occaſions, as they have weakneſs in abandoning themſelves to volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs in the time of Peace. Let us go then, generous Citizens, and let this be the end of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60144:182"/> my diſcourſe, and the beginning of your victory. Let us go out of this Palace, and deſcend into the City, where we are attended by a great number of our friends, for the ending of an enterprize ſo well begun. The gates are in the power of the Soldiers, whom I have gained to me, the Gallies upon a Signal given will fall into the hands of a Troop of men, as hardy to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves Maſters of them, as prudent to conſerve them. We have in the City fifteen hundred inhabitants, which are armed for us; and even now that I am ſpeaking to you, there are in the Suburbs two thouſand of my Subjects, and as many of the Duke of <hi>Placentia</hi>'s, which are come to ſuccor us.</p>
                  <p>Let us go then, my companions, and call the people again to liberty; let us return to the ſweetneſs of our ancient Government; let us exterminate the Nobles and <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s Tyranny; and in one only night, more ſhining then the faireſt days of our lives have been, let us re-eſtabliſh the glory of the popular families in their firſt ſplendor; let us for ever deface out of the memories of men our paſt faint-heartedneſs. But if any of you (as I cannot believe) be ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious &amp; ſo cowardly both together, as to oppoſe a deſign ſo glorious for us, and advantageous for our Country, let him behold round about him this dreadful company of Arms and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and let him imagine that he ſees at the very ſame inſtant the points of all our ſwords level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his heart. Yea, my Companions, I do proteſt it openly, we muſt of neceſſity either fight or dye. And that blood which ſhall be ingratefully denyed to the ſuccor of our Country, ſo neer to ruine, ſhall be ſhed, in this very place, to waſh away the ſtain of ſuch perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yea, I ſay it once again, the firſt ſacrifice, which ſhall be conſecrated for the publique ſafety, ſhall even here have his throat cut with my hand, if any one undertakes to oppoſe my will.</p>
                  <p>Theſe dreadful menaces amazed thoſe to whom they were addreſt; they beheld one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then that great number of Soldiers which environed them; and after they had been a while without ſpeaking, they cryed all with one voyce, two excepted, that they would follow the Count even to the death; that they would be the companions of his triumph, or of his fall; and in concluſion, that they would never abandon him, but would obey him in all things. The Count embraced them then with a great deal of joy, and teſtimony of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and being turned towards thoſe two, which as yet had ſaid nothing, they beſought him to have pity of their weakneſs, with words wherein fear appeared ſo viſible, as the Count could not forbear ſmiling. They repreſented unto him, that the requeſt which they made him, was advantageous to him, as well as to them; becauſe being ſo uncapable of fighting, they ſhould hurt him more then they could help him; that their fear might beget the ſame in others, and their flight give an ill example to his Soldiers: Briefly, they gave him ſo many marks of their affright and terror, as changing his determination, he only contented himſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching them for their cowardiſe in a bitter jear, and for the ſecurity of his enterprize he cauſed them to be ſhut up in a chamber, where he left them under a Guard, which ſhould keep them from coming forth. After this he commanded meat to be brought in, but in ſuch a faſhion, as this meal might be rather named a collation, then a ſupper; fearing leſt they ſhould be too much taken up with good chear. Whil'ſt then that ſome did eat ſtanding, and others were arming themſelves with the Arms which the Count had cauſed to be preſented unto them, he went to <hi>Leonora</hi>'s chamber, who was talking with <hi>Sophronia</hi> her ſiſter about the unquietneſs ſhe was in to ſee ſo many Soldiers in her Palace. As ſoon as he was entred, he approached to her, and taking her by the hand, he told her in few words the deſign he had; deſiring her to pardon him for not having ſpoken to her of it till then.</p>
                  <p>The great heart of <hi>Leonora</hi> found not it ſelf firm enough to remain conſtant in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and conſidering the extream peril whereinto the Count was going to expoſe himſelf, affection and fear troubled her in ſuch ſort, as falling at the Counts feet, and her face all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with tears, My Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, imbracing his knees, to what danger are you going to expoſe your ſelf? I conjure you by the thing that is deareſt to you in the world, by the love which I bear to you, by that which you b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The intereſt of our Country is dear to me, but yours is yet far more to me. I had rather have <hi>Jannetin</hi> raign inſolently, then to ſee you periſh for the ſaving of others. And I ſhall reſolve with joy to wear chains, rather then to ſee my ſelf expoſed to the hazard of wearing mourning for your death. But what ſay I, ſenſleſs as I am? could I preſerve my life, if you were no longer living? No, no,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60144:182"/> my deſtiny is tyed to yours; and what my deſpair could not do in this occaſion, my grief alone would execute. Let <hi>Jannetin</hi> then, my dear husband, uſurp the Empire; let our Country be ruined; let all our Citizens be made Slaves; provided that you live it imports me not. For in the end <hi>Jannetin</hi> may indeed raiſe himſelf up into the Throne, but he can never ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount you in greatneſs of courage and vertue. You have told me an hundred times, that I made up all your felicity, what do you ſeek for then, O my dear husband! Is it juſt, that you ſhould be ſo far ſenſible of the complaints of a people, that may be ingrateful, as to loſe your life for their liberty? And that my tears ſhould move you ſo little, as that you will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me, in preſerving your ſelf? What will you have me do in this fatal adventure? Will you have me, letting you go, attend here the news of your death? Ah! I can never endure this thought, no more then your deſign. For, my Lord, what can this deſign be, which I ſee you undertake, without communicating it to your deareſt friends? To whom of all thoſe, which are in this Palace, may I entruſt your life? Are you your ſelf aſſured, that they will not abandon you? If I ſaw the generous <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs, and ſo many other illuſtrious friends, which you have, about you, I could ſay that they would vanquiſh, or dye together with you. But in the eſtate wherein I ſee you, it may be that thoſe, whom you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to be moſt faithful unto you, have betrayed you, and have undertaken to deſtroy you. Ah! my Lord, give an end to my fears and tears, in changing ſo deadly a reſolution. But if nevertheleſs you are determined, as methinks I obſerve by your looks, not to let your ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Count,</hi> feeling himſelf very much moved with <hi>Leonora</hi>'s tears, and fearing to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted by them, interrupted her with embraces; do not make ſo ill a preſage of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, ſaid he unto her, and carry that great heart, which I have always admired in you, to higher and more happy thoughts. I am going to a place, whither Juſtice and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune call me; and if I have concealed this deſign from my friends, it is becauſe I knew they loved my life too well to counſel me unto it. And then again I ſhall be glad, if Heaven will permit me to prevail over my Enemies, that I have given them a content which hath coſt them nothing; and if I fall in ſo brave an enterprize, they ſhall at leaſt-wiſe remain to comfort you. <hi>In fine,</hi> my dear <hi>Leonora,</hi> prepare your minde for all events that may arrive, either happy, or unhappy; for the buſineſs is at ſuch a paſs, as I can neither defer, or break it off: But this I can aſſure you, that you ſhall not be long in uncertainty, and that in a few hours you ſhall hear of my death, or victory; howſoever it be, remember, that, glory excepted, I never loved any thing more then you. Farewell, my dear <hi>Leonora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this word his ambitious Mother came and interrupted him; who knowing that the <hi>Count</hi> was touched with his Wives tears, and fearing he ſhould be overcome by them, Go, go, ſaid ſhe unto him, and call to minde, that if <hi>Coriolanus</hi> had never been wrought upon by the tears of a woman, he had gotten himſelf the Empire, and preſerved his life. Fear not, my ſon, that I will be <hi>Volumnia</hi> in this encounter, but contrarily I command you, as much as I can, to haſten the execution of your enterprize, for all the time which you have loſt here, would already have ſerved you for your approach to the Throne: Go then, my ſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an action proportionable to your courage, or finde a death worthy of your birth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count,</hi> having heard his Mother ſpeak in this ſort, and having told her that he would obey her, turned himſelf once again to <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom grief ſuffocated, and beholding her with a troubled countenance, <hi>Farewell,</hi> ſaid he unto her, <hi>either you ſhall never ſee me more, or you ſhall ſee your ſelf in</hi> Genoua <hi>above all others of your ſex.</hi> At theſe laſt words he left her, without harkening to the generous <hi>Panſa,</hi> or the ſage <hi>Sophronia;</hi> For as for <hi>Leonora,</hi> ſhe was ſo ſtrucken with the <hi>Count's</hi> ſpeech and departure, as ſhe fell into a ſwoon.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Baptista Verrin</hi> was come back from the City, to aſſure the <hi>Count</hi> that there was no obſtacle which could hinder his deſign; that his Gally was in a poſture of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, full of a great number of Soldiers, throughly reſolved to do then duty, and ready to ſhut up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60144:183"/> made all them to take up Arms which were to follow him, he iſſued out of his Palace three hours after midnight. And to march in order, he made as it were a Vant-guard of an hundred and fifty of the reſoluteſt Soldiers he had, whom he advanced forty paces before; himſelf he put in the head of all thoſe young Gentlemen, which he had brought along with him; and after marched in rank, and as it were in a battalion, all the reſt of his men. When he was arrived at the Suburbs, he commanded ſome Soldiers to go under the conduct of a natural Brother of his, named <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and ſeize upon the Bow gate, which was preſently executed; <hi>Cornelio</hi> finding no other reſiſtance then of a few Soldiers, who being ſurprized, ſcarce fought at all. This proſperous ſucceſs redoubling the <hi>Count's</hi> courage, he ſent <hi>Giralomo</hi> and <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buono</hi> his Brothers, with <hi>Vincentio Calcagna,</hi> who notwithſtanding his natural timidity had not left following him, to render themſelves Maſters of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Gate. He deſcended afterwards through S. <hi>Andrews</hi> ſtreet to S. <hi>Donat,</hi> and paſſing by the place of the <hi>Salvages</hi> with his companions, he arrived at the point of <hi>Catana.

                     </gap>n, wherewith he was followed, they rudely repulſed him: Nevertheleſs ſeeing it was neceſſary, that ſome one ſhould enter to open the gate unto the <hi>Count,</hi> it was reſolved that <hi>Scipio,</hi> one of his ſubjects, and a Captain of great courage, ſhould caſt himſelf with ſome Soldiers into little Boats, kept there of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in caſe of neceſſity, and by that means enter by the Sea into the Port, where the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies lay, and ſo facilitate the entrance of the reſt of the Conſpirators thereinto. This deſign was as happily executed, as it was well thought of; for albeit they found ſome reſiſtance there, yet in regard the Conſpirators were more in number, and incomparably more valorous, it was eaſie for them to prevail.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Count</hi> was come by Land to that Gate, where with much impatience he attended the ſignal that was to be given him, which ſtayd longer then it ought, by reaſon the Gally with her motion and agitation had ſtruck her ſelf a ground, and it was above half an hour before they could ſet her afloat again. All theſe things, which could not be done without noiſe, began to raiſe a great deal; but at length the ſignal having been given, the <hi>Count,</hi> devancing all his companions, leapt with exceeding courage into <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies. This unexp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cted violence, and the noiſe of Arms and Soldiers, having awaked all the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Slaves, a dreadful and confuſed din of chains and voyces was ſuddenly heard. All the Sailors cryed to Arms, all the Gally-Slaves reſounded the name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and labored as much as they could to break off their Irons: But the <hi>Count,</hi> who knew not what to do with the Gallies if he had not men, conſidering what a prejudice the flight of the Slaves would bring unto him, he caſt himſelf aſhore again, and went with all ſpeed to the Admiral, which with the ſudden and unruly motion of them wherewith ſhe was filled, floated leaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſeemed as though ſhe would eloign her ſelf from the Land.</p>
                  <p>Whil'ſt things paſt thus in the Port, <hi>Giralomo</hi> and <hi>Ottobuono</hi> failed not in that which had been commanded them; for as ſoon as they heard the Cannon diſcharged, which was the ſignal that was given to them, they went couragiouſly with threeſcore Soldiers to ſeize on S. <hi>Thomas</hi> gate, not onely to render themſelves Maſters of it, but to paſs along unto <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace, which was hard by, for to kill <hi>Andrea</hi> and <hi>Jannetin.</hi> This enterprize was not ſo facile unto the Conſpirators, as the former; the Soldiers that guarded this gate defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wel enough; and <hi>Sebaſtiano Lercato</hi> with his Brother, whereof the one was the Captain, and the other the Enſign, coming in, made all the reſiſtance that valiant men could do: But in the end, ſome of their Soldiers being corrupted, and the aſſailants fighting like men that would vanquiſh or dye, they were conſtrained to give place to the ſtronger, and the gate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the power of the Conſpirators, the Captain being made a priſoner, and the Enſign ſlain there.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the cries, clamors, and noiſe of Arms, which increaſed in the Port, where the Gallies were, arrived even at <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace, which as you know is not far d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n out amongſt the people of his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60144:183"/> Gallies. <hi>Andrea,</hi> more foreſeeing then he, and fearing ſome unlooked for accident, would not have had him gone forth, but well accompanyed; His Wife caſt her ſelf at his feet to keep him from it: but he, carryed on by his deſtiny, contemned the counſel of the one, and the prayers of the other, and went out alone with one Groom of his Chamber, and a Page, that carryed a Torch before him, without any other Arms, then his ſingle ſword. When he arrived at Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> gate, which he thought was guarded ſtill by his own followers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſolent humor, whereunto the choller he was in that time being joyned, he fiercely commanded them to open unto him. <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s voyce being ſtraightway known of the Conſpirators, they opened the gate, and ſuffered him to enter without reſiſtance; but ſcarcely was he entred, when as a ſhowre of Musket ſhot fell on him, and layd hm inſtantly dead on the ground. This adventure made <hi>Giralomo</hi> and <hi>Ottobuono</hi> change the order which the <hi>Count</hi> had given them, for going directly to <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace. For ſeeing <hi>Jannetin</hi> dead, who was the onely man of the <hi>Count's</hi> Enemies, that could ſatisfie with his perſon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that the <hi>Count</hi> had rendred himſelf Maſter of the Gallies, they did not think that <hi>Andrea,</hi> fourſcore years of age, and ſick of the gout, could bring any great obſtacle to their deſign. Moreover they feared, that if they ſhould go to <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace, the riches of the booty would withdraw the moſt part of the Soldiers from the action, and make them quit their Arms, to lade themſelves with the plunder of ſuch rich movables, as it was full of.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the noiſe and diſorder ſtill increaſing, <hi>Andrea</hi> was much troubled for <hi>Jannetin,</hi> not being able to imagine what ſhould be the cauſe of ſo much ſtir. But at length having ſent one of his ſervants, certainly to know the occaſion of this Tumult, he brought him word, that the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Lavagna</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Genoua;</hi> that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique was in extream peril; that his Gallies were full of his Enemies; that the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded all about the word of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the name of <hi>Giovanni Lodovico;</hi> that furious men ran up and down with Arms in their hands; that there was nothing ſeen but blood and ſlaughter; and that every where was talking of outrages againſt the Nobles, and menaces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his life. So dreadful a relation perſwading <hi>Andrea</hi> that the matter was paſt remedy, he reſolved to attend the violence of his Enemies in his Palace, and to yield to them whom he could not reſiſt. But his wife, and his ſervants, with their tears, intreaties and reaſons, made him at laſt reſolve to let himſelf be carryed down into his Palace-yard, where they ſet him on an horſe with much ado; in this eſtate they conducted him to <hi>Mazona,</hi> which is a Caſtle belonging to a Kinſman of mine, and from thence to another place, where they underſtood the death of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> with which he was ſenſibly touched.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Conſpirators ſtill advanced their deſign; and whereas this noiſe and Tumult had awaked every one, all the <hi>Count's</hi> particular friends having heard the people cry, <hi>Long live the Count</hi> of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> went forth with Arms in their hands to ſee what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, and to joyn themſelves with him; and amongſt the reſt <hi>Doria,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Marquis, and I, who by chance lay together that night, going alſo forth to ſeek the <hi>Count,</hi> met ſome thirty paces from my lodging, <hi>Giralomo</hi> with all his Troop, who ſought for him as well as we. All the people, that took his part, required to ſee their Deliverer; but though there was crying every where, <hi>Long live the Count</hi> of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> and that every one enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, yet no body anſwered thereunto. This ſilence made us fear ſome diſaſtrous ſucceſs, yet did it not make them give over the deſign of purſuing a victory, which ſeemed ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Giralomo</hi> left a ſufficient Guard at the gates, and ſent <hi>Ottobuono</hi> to take a care of the Gallies, in caſe his Brother was not there. The <hi>French</hi> Marquis followed him, and I ſtay'd with <hi>Giralomo,</hi> who being accompanyed onely with two hundred Soldiers, went, as he had reſolved, through all the ſtreets of <hi>Genoua,</hi> to cauſe the people, both with his ſpeeches, and the hope of Liberty, to riſe. And though the <hi>Count</hi> appeared not, yet each one decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf for him, with earneſtly demanding where he was. The City in the mean ſpace was in a general confuſion and conſternation; every one ran up and down in the ſtreets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing whither they went; every one asked of one another what was the cauſe of this dreadful diſorder, without knowing what to anſwer; the women out of their windows, in the midſt of the cries and lamentations which they made, called for their husbands, their brothers, and their children. The Nobles, in ſo great a diſorder, would willingly for the publique intereſt have reſorted to the Palace, that they might have adviſed together what to do, but their particular intereſt kept them from it, and the doubt they were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60144:184"/> in, leſt their houſes ſhould be plundered in their abſence, retained them ſtill there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſars</hi> Embaſſador, ſurprized with this unexpected accident, was upon the point of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Genoua,</hi> for fear leſt the perſon of the Prince, to whom he belonged, ſhould be outraged in his; but at length after he had gotten company about him, he reſolved to ſee the matter decided, and according to occaſions to take ſuch a courſe as ſhould be moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for his Maſter. To that effect he went to the Palace, where he found Cardinal <hi>Doria</hi> and ſome others, who conſulted with the Senate, whereof <hi>Nicola Franco</hi> was the Chief, there being no Duke at that time. They reſolved that <hi>Bonifacio Lomellin,</hi> one of the <hi>Pallaxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Calvo,</hi> with the Enſign of the Guard and fifty Soldiers, ſhould go and defend S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Gate; but having on the way encountred with the Troop where we were, they were conſtrained to retire into one of their friends houſes, but not without leaving ſome of their men priſoners. Part of them went in great haſte by another ſtreet to the ſame gate to learn ſome news of <hi>Andrea;</hi> but finding it well guarded, and <hi>Lomellin</hi> having at the very firſt been made a priſoner, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the mean time it was not known where the Count was; they that were with <hi>Giralomo</hi> thought he was at the Port; they of the Port on the other ſide believed that he had left them to repair unto his brothers; <hi>Ottobuono</hi> not finding him there, thought that he was gone to viſit the Gates, or it may be to <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace; they of the Gates were perſwaded that he was in the City; <hi>in fine,</hi> every one thought any thing ſave the truth. But amongſt all the reſt, <hi>Baptiſta Verrin,</hi> as having the greateſt ſhare in the enterprize, was moſt earneſt in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him. He ſaw the buſineſs ſo well carried, and the Victory ſo certain, as he was mad for that he could not ſee the Count; the Gates of the City were theirs; they were Maſters of the Port; the people favored them; the Nobles ſeemed to make no oppoſition; the Senate had no Duke; <hi>Andrea</hi> was fled, and had left the field to his Enemies; and <hi>Jannetin</hi> was dead; <hi>in fine,</hi> there wanted nothing but that the Count ſhould ſhew himſelf to the people for receiving the Oath of Allegeance from them. But all <hi>Verrin</hi>'s care was in vain, ſo that hearing no news of him, and ſeeing the enterprize ruined if he did not appear, he retired in deſpair unto the Gally, to the end that if the Count came, he might ſecure him the Port ſtill, which was a matter of extream importance; and if the enterprize were ruined by his abſence, that he might have the means to fly to <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> This reſolution was the cauſe of very much miſchief to <hi>Giralomo;</hi> becauſe the Conſpirators, neither ſeeing the Count, who was their Head, nor <hi>Baptista Verrin,</hi> who had been always the principal Agent in the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, did not ſo much rely on the conduct of <hi>Giralomo,</hi> who being very young, and of an haughty humor, carried things with more impetuoſity then diſcretion: They followed him for all that out of the hope that the Count would appear ere it were long; but it was not with that confidence, which makes one abandon his life without unquietneſs, and obey without repugnancy an Head whom one eſteems, and of whoſe prudence and valor one is aſſured, ſo that one reſerves no more care then to fight and obey: but contrarily the moſt part began to murmur, yea and ſome thought already of ſeeking ſome occaſion to withdraw, or at leaſtwiſe to go and enquire out the Count. On the other ſide, the Senate, not knowing what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take, and beleeving that affairs were altogether remedileſs, deſired Cardinal <hi>Doria,</hi> and ſome others, to go and find out the Count of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> which at firſt he accepted of, but ſome having counſelled him not to expoſe his dignity to the inſolencies of a people in fury, he refuſed it; and the Senate deputed for the ſame effect ſix Gentlemen of quality, with order to know of the Count what he deſired. But at the ſame time, when as the Deputies went out of the Palace to ſeek for the Count, we underſtood, Madam, the moſt deplorable adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever arrived: For ſince our ill fortune muſt be told you, we learned that the Count, being returned to Land (as I have already declared to you) from aboard <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies, to go to the Admiral, which he meant to ſecure himſelf of, in paſſing over a plank, which lay with one end on the Land, and with the other on a little ladder that is near to the Poop, the Gally ſtirring ſomewhat made the plank loſe its hold, ſo that it fell, and in falling tumbled the Count into the water, who being armed at all pieces could not diſ-engage himſelf from that peril; and even thoſe arms, which he had taken to preſerve his life, were the cauſe of his death; for had it not been for them, he f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll ſo near the ſhoar, as it was impoſſible he ſhould have been drowned: the tumult and the darkneſs contributed alſo very much to his loſs,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60144:184"/> which was not ſeen by any of his followers, and that was the reaſon it was publiſhed no ſooner. We had no certain knowledg of it but by the <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs, who being gone, as I have told you, with <hi>Ottobuoni,</hi> and asking of every one where the Count was, two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners of the Admiral, who had ſeen him fall, and heard his voyce which they knew very well, as having ſerved him before-times, aſſured him that he was dead; which having underſtood with extream grief, he thought it fit to come unto us, and acquaint <hi>Giralomo</hi> with it; for as for <hi>Ottobuono</hi> he had loſt him in the preſs. He came preſently away then, to acquaint us with this doleful news, but having encountred, as he told us, with a great number of armed men, which iſſued out of your Palace, whereof the Gate was broken up, he ſtayed to learn what the matter might be; and thinking that he knew the voyce of <hi>Emilia,</hi> whom they were carrying forcibly away, he purſued them fighting even to the Port.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſabella</hi> hereupon remembred her carrying away, and interrupting <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> Behold, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Emilia,</hi> that which we could not comprehend, and the true cauſe of that dreadful diſorder, whereof I thought that I had been the occaſion. And then ſhe recounted, how ſhe had been forcibly carried away, and after ſhe had teſtified her gratitude to the <hi>French</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs for the ſuccor he would have given her, and craved pardon of the company for her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s relation, he continued his diſcourſe in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs having been a good while purſuing thoſe which carried you away, it was the cauſe that we knew not the deplorable death of the Count, till there wanted nothing but his preſence, to make an end of obtaining the Victory: And judg, Madam, whether there can be any doubt of this verity, ſince the Count being dead almoſt at the beginning of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, it may be ſaid that his name alone vanquiſhed all his Enemies: And certainly if he had lived, the buſineſs had had a quite contrary event. For my part I profeſs unto you, that I ſhall never be comforted for this death. Had the enterprize ſucceeded ill; had any of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators betrayed him; had the people abandoned him; had the Nobles reſiſted him; had <hi>Jannetin</hi> vanquiſhed him; I ſhould ſay that theſe are ordinary things, that theſe are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, whereof there are are examples found: But to ſee a man of two and twenty years of age, the goodlieſt, the handſomeſt, the moſt courageous, the moſt dextrous, the fulleſt of ſpirit, and the moſt generous that ever was ſeen, to ſee him, I ſay, after he had contrived a great deſign; after he had ſo admirably conducted it; after he had deceived <hi>Andrea Doria;</hi> abuſed the whole Republique; was come not only to the execution, but alſo had executed the buſineſs; <hi>Jannetin</hi> being dead, and <hi>Andrea</hi> himſelf fled away; after all theſe things, I ſay, to imagine, that this excellent man ſhould fall from off a plank, and be drowned not above three or four ſteps from the Land in five food of mud, is ſo unſupporable to me, Madam, as I cannot endure the thought of it.</p>
                  <p>But to teſtifie unto you, that the Count alone held the Victory in his hands, I am but to to tell you the end of this enterprize. The <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs had no ſooner acquainted <hi>Gira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomo</hi> with the death of his brother, but the Deputies from the Senate appeared. At firſt, ſome would have ſet upon them, nevertheleſs this tumult being appeaſed, one of the Deputies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and demanded of <hi>Giralomo</hi> where the Count was, to acquaint him with what he had in charge from the Senate; <hi>Giralomo</hi> ſurprized with this demand, anſwered rudely and inconſiderately, that he ſhould ſeek for no other Count of <hi>Lavagna</hi> but himſelf, for he was now the Count, and that to him only they were to render up the Palace, which he ordained them to do, and that with ſpeed. The Deputies underſtanding by this imprudent anſwer that the Count was dead, returned back to advertiſe the Senate of the change of things by the death of the Count. This news put them in heart again, ſo that they inſtantly commanded twelve of the chiefeſt of them, that were come to the Palace, to go and arm as many of the people as they could, and joyning them with the ordinary guard, to uſe their uttermoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to chaſe the Conſpirators out of the City, or utterly to defeat them: But there was no need of fighting to put them to flight, for they were vanquiſhed in the death of the Count; which being publiſhed over all, put one and the ſame reſolution into the minds of all thoſe who had taken up arms for him. And whereas the day began to break, they deſired it ſhould not be ſaid, that they had been in arms againſt their Citizens; wherefore they began to retire one after another to their homes: They which had taken arms in the Counts Palace left them in the ſtreets, for fear leſt if their houſes ſhould come to be ſearched, they might have been convicted of being of the number of the Rebels; and they which contrarily had taken them
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60144:185"/> in their own homes, carried them thither again, for fear left leaving them in the ſtreets they might be accuſed for making uſe of them in this occaſion.

                  <p>In the mean time the generous <hi>Panſa</hi> having been ſent for by the Senate, who perfectly knew the vertue of this excellent man, he ſo wrought with them, that he got them to change the order they had given for fighting with <hi>Giralomo,</hi> into that of propounding unto him his departure out of <hi>Genoua,</hi> his retiring unto <hi>Montobio</hi> which belonged to him, and pardoning in conſideration of him all the Conſpirators, provided they continued ſtill in the City. <hi>Panſa</hi> was choſen to make this propoſition, which was accepted, and executed inſtantly. So that the break of day arriving, one would have ſaid, that the blood which was ſeen ſpilt on the ground; the bodies of thoſe that had been ſlain; the houſes that had been broken up; and ſo many other diſorders, whereof the marks were evident; had been the work of an inviſible hand.

The <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs was carried thither by his own generoſity, and I by the deſire I had to ſerve the Count in the perſon of <hi>Leonora.</hi> At ſuch time as we left <hi>Giralomo,</hi> he had ſtill ſome Soldiers about him, ſo that beleeving him to be in ſafety enough we went to the Counts Palace, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome violence would be offered to her; there we met with <hi>Horatio,</hi> come thither as well as we, and at the ſame inſtant, with a Gentleman from <hi>Ottobuono,</hi> who after he knew of his brothers death, had gotten with <hi>Baptiſta Verrin, Raphaello Sacco,</hi> and <hi>Vincentio Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagna,</hi> into the Counts Gally for to fly away; but being moved with compaſſion for <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,</hi> he ſent this Gentleman to will her that ſhe would get her ſelf to be ſafely conducted to the Port, where ſhe might ſave her ſelf with him. We being then thus all encountred here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Sophronia,</hi> who had heard of our repair thither, left <hi>Leonora</hi> on her bed, and came out unto us; for ſhe rightly imagined, that it may be we had ſome diſmal news to tell, which was not fit for her to know. She preſently diſcerned by our looks the misfortune that was arrived unto as; but it being no time to lament, we arreſted our tears and her ſighs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto her the eſtate of things, we repreſented unto her, that we were not to ſuffer the Count to be outraged in the perſon of <hi>Leonora;</hi> that her loſs was undoubted if ſhe ſtayed longer in this Palace; that the people peradventure would come and ſet it on fire; or it may be the Senate would cauſe it to be razed to the ground; and that <hi>in fine</hi> it was requiſite by flight to avoyd outrages worſe then death; that <hi>Julio Cibo</hi> her eldeſt brother hated them all; that it would be glorious for her to make away with a brother of her husbands; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that it was for her to perſwade <hi>Leonora</hi> to the taking of this reſolution; that for us, we proteſted unto her, that we would follow her fortune; and that the Counts mother, albeit the cauſe of his loſs, was notwithſtanding to be ſet in a place of ſafety, for the glory of her ſon; for fear leſt ſome extraordinary violence ſhould be uſed againſt her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sophronia</hi> having muſed a while ſaid, She was confident that <hi>Leonora,</hi> if once ſhe came to know the death of the Count, would never think of preſerving her life; that the only fear of it had already put her into ſuch a violent deſpair, as it would be impoſſible to make her reſolve for that which they deſired of her, when ſhe ſhould be aſſured of it. <hi>Doria,</hi> having heard this objection, ſaid, that <hi>Leonora</hi> was to be beguiled, and only told, that the Counts enterprize ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſucceeded ill, he was retired into his Gally, whither he willed her to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This advice being well approved of, we entred into <hi>Leonora</hi>'s chamber, who no ſooner ſaw us, but ſhe roſe up, and with a diſmayed countenance and tears in her eyes, ſhe demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us, whether the Count were dead? we anſwered her as we had before reſolved; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the buſineſs unto her with as many circumſtances as we could, to render it the more
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60144:185"/> probable, we ſo wrought with her, that ſhe believed us, and conſtantly reſolved for her flight. We found not the ſame facility in the Counts mother; What, ſaid ſhe unto us, doth he, who promiſed me to vanquiſh or to dye, prepare himſelf to fly? Ah! baſe and inconſiderate, cryed ſhe, I will go to find thee out, not to fly away with thee, but to oblige thee once more to fight, and if I cannot do that, I ſhall at leaſtwiſe have the ſatisfaction of reproaching thee for thy want of courage. This ſaid, ſhe marched foremoſt, and I advanced to lead her; <hi>Sophronia</hi> took a little casket wherein her ſiſters jewels were, and unto her <hi>Doria</hi> lent his hand; the <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs conducted <hi>Leonora;</hi> as for <hi>Horatio,</hi> he followed alone, being very much grieved to abandon <hi>Hipolita:</hi> But Fortune, who was willing to favor him, ſo ordered it, that being arrived juſt before <hi>Doria</hi>'s houſe, we heard people coming in wonderful haſte, which without doubt were ſome of them that fled; finding our ſelves then in ſo commodious a place for to let them paſs by, we entred into <hi>Doria</hi>'s houſe; and whereas <hi>Hipolita</hi> was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled both for her brother and her Lover, ſhe no ſooner heard their two voyces, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſome womens, but ſhe came down to us, and underſtanding our deſign, What, ſaid ſhe to her brother, will you abandon me?

And having loſt my mother, and ſeeing my ſelf forſaken of my brother, ſhall I abide here without ſupport and comfort? I do not deſire you to leave <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia,</hi> but that you will permit me to follow her. <hi>Hipolita</hi> ſpake this with ſo much grief, that every one was touched with it. And when as <hi>Horatio</hi> prayed <hi>Sophronia,</hi> that ſhe would oblige <hi>Doria</hi> to conſent thereunto, <hi>Doria</hi> imbraced his ſiſter with a great deal of affection, and told her, that he was raviſhed with her generoſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hipolita</hi> having obtained her deſire, and we no longer hearing any paſſing by, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on in our way towards the Port, where we arrived without any obſtacle. <hi>Ottobuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s Gentleman conducted us to the <hi>Count's</hi> Gally, where we were received, and <hi>Leonora</hi> put into the Captains Cabbin, being told that the <hi>Count</hi> would come thither to her.

                  <p>This while, Madam, we remained in the Gally of this illuſtrious infortunate man, but with ſo much grief, as never voyage had ſo ſad a beginning. <hi>Baptiſta Verrin</hi> was mad to ſee his enterprize broken; <hi>Vincentio Calcagna</hi> upbraided him with being the cauſe of all this miſchief; <hi>Raphaello Sacco</hi> rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As for the reſt of us, although we had all of us misfortunes, which diverſly regarded us, yet the death of the <hi>Count</hi> prevailed over all our other ſufferings, and his loſs in this occaſion made up all our ſorrow. In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Leonora,</hi> not ſeeing him, and perceiving the Gally make from the Port, preſſed <hi>Sophronia</hi> that ſhe might ſee him, and hearing her ſiſter make her no preciſe anſwer, ſhe of her ſelf knew the misfortune that was happened unto him: And when as we entred into her chamber all at one time, and that ſhe ſaw him not amongſt us, ſhe cryed out, and ſaid, <hi>There is no longer doubt but that the</hi> Count <hi>it dead.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> dead! ſaid the Mother with a great deal of precipitation. Yes, Madam, continued <hi>Vincentio Calcagna,</hi> who was extreamly touched with this loſs, and dead by your commandment: you enjoyned him to vanquiſh or to dye, and he hath done both,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60144:186"/> Madam; for he is dead after the death of his Enemy. We were very ſorry that this man had delivered the matter ſo bluntly before the infortunate <hi>Leonora,</hi> who unable to ſupport ſo many ſorrows at once, ſwooned in the Arms of <hi>Sophronia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Count's</hi> Mother, ſhe entred into a rage that cannot be repreſented unto you; the apprehenſions of a Mother having re-aſſumed their place in her ſoul, ſhe ſaid all that grief, anger, repentance, fury, and deſpair could make one ſay. <hi>Oh!</hi> cryed ſhe, <hi>it is I that have layd the</hi> Count <hi>in his grave! I am thinking of my ſafety, and making from a place, where it may be I ſhould be puniſhed for the crime I have commited! Ah, no, no, I muſt be carryed back to Land; I muſt go and be torn in pieces by an enraged people: I muſt acquaint them that I am the onely cauſe of the Conspiracy, and ſo loſing my life by their fury, receive the puniſhment which I deſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whil'ſt this ambitious woman repented her of her violence, and puniſhed her ſelf for her own fault, the unhappy <hi>Leonora</hi> came out of her ſwoon; ſhe had no ſooner opened her eyes, but turning her ſelf to her ſiſter, ſhe demanded of her where the <hi>Count's</hi> body was, and pray'd her that at leaſt-wiſe they would let her ſee it. We thought then, to the end her grief might not be renewed another time, that it was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Count's</hi> misfortune, redoubled <hi>Leonora</hi>'s affliction. <hi>Could I not at leaſt,</hi> ſaid ſhe with a languiſhing voyce, <hi>have had the conſolation to be incloſed with him in the ſame Tomb?</hi> ſcarcely had ſhe ended thoſe words, but ſuddenly paſſing from one extremity to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſhe roſe up with violence, and intreated us that we would leave her on the ſhore, there to ſpend her life in ſeeking for the body of her dear Husband. And when as we reſiſted her intreaties, ſhe termed us ingrateful, cruel, and inſenſible; nay ſhe would have rid her ſelf out of our hands, to have gone and caſt her ſelf into the Sea, but at length the exceſs of her grief, and her weakneſs, made her tumble down again into <hi>Sophronia</hi>'s arms, almoſt without any ſenſe; and after that, as long as we were upon the Sea, we never heard her ſpeak but once onely, which was the next day at night, when as there aroſe ſo furious a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, as we verily believed we ſhould have ſuffered ſhipw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But not to weary you with ſo doleful a relation, I ſhall tell you in few words, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt redoubled in ſuch ſort, that it drove us to <hi>Albengua,</hi> where <hi>Leonida</hi> having a houſe, was gone thither a good while before. We had no ſooner caſt anchor, but having been advertiſed of the miſhap of her dear friends, ſhe came to viſit them, and would ſo far take part with them in their afflictions, that when we had furniſhed our ſelves with another Veſſel at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bengua,</hi> and were putting forth again to Sea, ſhe would not abandon them.

Now for that which arrived unto us there, and for that which brought us to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I think it will be requiſite to refer the relation thereof to another time: And whereas the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Hipolita</hi> and <hi>Sophronia</hi> have a greater ſhare in it then I, you ſhall, if you pleaſe, learn the ſequel of our fortune from their mouths.</p>
                  <p>It is without doubt very deplorable, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and I can aſſure you, that I have not felt that motion in my heart, which they ſay is ſo ordinary with every one, and cauſes us in ſome ſort to be comforted for our miſeries, when we ſee others infortunate as well as our ſelves; but contrarily I finde my ſorrow augmented thereby.

For whereas they knew us at the firſt ſight to be Chriſtians, hardly had we caſt anchor when as they made us Slaves. Indeed it is true, that in the beginning our ſervitude was eaſie enough; for as our good Fortune would have it, the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> ſiſter to King <hi>Abdalla,</hi> who raigns at <hi>Marocco,</hi> paſſed accidentally along by the Port when as we were making into it; and this Princeſs ſeeing our ſhip without ſails, without rudder, the tackle torn, the ſail-yards broken, and every part of it almoſt battered in pieces, ſhe cauſed the Charet, wherein ſhe was, to ſtay, that ſhe might ſee us land, and know of what Nation we were: for the Tempeſt had left our Veſſel no marks, whereby it might be known. When as we came near the Port, whither the wind, rather then the skill of the Pilot, conducted us, there was not one in the Ship which got not up on the deck to behold this Land, where we hoped, if we did not find a refuge, at leaſtwiſe we ſhould eſcape caſting away: So that the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> having obſerved women amongſt us, redoubled her curioſity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion much the more. As ſoon as ever we touched Land, then ſhe commanded us to be brought unto her, that ſhe her ſelf might know who we were, and what our fortune had been. This order having been obſerved, they led us before this Princeſs; and verily this firſt encounter was an happy preſage for us, and an extream conſolation for the beautiful <hi>Sophronia, Leonida,</hi> and <hi>Hipolita;</hi> for this Princeſs hath ſo much majeſty and ſweetneſs, as ſhe cauſed in us both a great deal of reſpect, and a great deal of hope. And whereas ſhe had noted by our apparel that we were of <hi>Italy,</hi> and not underſtanding that Tongue, ſhe would not ſtand to ſend for an Interpreter, but thought that ſome of us peradventure could ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> which ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood perfectly, and is common enough throughout all the Kingdoms of <hi>Fez, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Marocco,</hi> by reaſon of the neighborhood of <hi>Spain</hi> with this part of <hi>Affrica,</hi> and of the Wars and Commerce, which in former times they have had one with another, eſpecially before the Kings of <hi>Granado,</hi> who were originally Moors, were ſubdued by <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella.</hi> And truly ſhe was not deceived in her conjecture, for there was not any of us but ſpake it well, or at leaſtwiſe could make our ſelves be underſtood in it.</p>
                  <p>When as this Princeſs ſaw that her deſign had ſucceeded, ſhe teſtified as much joy for it as we did; and having demanded of us whither we were going, of whence we were, and in what place we had been taken with the Tempeſt? we told her all things as they had paſt, without acquainting her nevertheleſs with the occaſion that had cauſed us to part from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> and without telling her our names, and falling at her feet we beſought her to protect us; for by the reſpect which was rendred to her, and by her train, we believed ſhe was Queen of <hi>Marocco.</hi> This excellent Princeſs made us riſe up with a great deal of courteſie; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched with the charms of thoſe whom we conducted, ſhe took an affection to us, and reſolved to ſerve us as much as ſhe could. But whereas ſhe was willing to obſerve in all things the reſpect which ſhe owed to the King her brother, ſhe took up <hi>Sophronia, Leonida,</hi> and my ſiſter, into the Charet to her, and commanding us to follow her, ſhe willed ſome of the Guard that attended upon her, to lend us their horſes. We went in this manner to <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla</hi>'s Palace, whom we found alone with his Favorite, called <hi>Ali-Ben Ducar,</hi> a man of a great ſpirit, but cruel and ambitious.

The Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> who had ſo much goodneſs, as that ſhe would not be ſuſpected of us, ſaid unto him in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> (for he underſtood it as well as ſhe,) that Fortune having put ſo many afflicted

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aly,</hi> who underſtood this Tongue, and that all the time of <hi>Mariama's</hi> diſcourſe had eyed <hi>Hipolita,</hi> as well as <hi>Abdalla,</hi> with a great deal of attention, and it may be already with a great deal of love, approached and ſaid in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that one muſt needs be very inhumane, which would not protect ſuch beautiful perſons; but, continued he, ſpeaking to <hi>Mariama</hi> in her natural Tongue, you may not, Madam, deprive theſe three fair creatures, of the honor of being your Slaves; Liberty cannot be ſo happy to them as this ſervitude, and you will be cruel to them in uſing them otherwiſe. <hi>Aly</hi> hath reaſon, replyed the King in his language, and to content you and them to, I permit you to take care of them, and to protect them; and I do withall conjure you to retain them in your ſervice. You know that all the Chriſtians are our Enemies, ſo that to ſet them at liberty, when we have them in our hands, were to violate our Religion, and to infringe our Laws, wherefore accept of theſe fair ſtrangers for your Slaves: But whereas their beauty deſerves a gentler uſage then others, give them no other, ſaid he ſmiling, but cords of ſilk to retain them. My Lord, anſwered <hi>Mariama,</hi> the greateſt of all good things is Liberty, and by conſequence the greateſt of all evils is ſervitude; there are no chains that are not heavy, and the leſs they be, the more do they ſtraiten him that wears them; <hi>In fine,</hi> my Lord, either they do load him, or they do wring him, and both the one and the other is always grievous.</p>
                  <p>It was in this ſort, Madam, that the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> ſpake to obtain our liberty; and that which carried her yet more to oblige us, was, becauſe <hi>Aly,</hi> whom ſhe extreamly hated, had at firſt oppoſed our deliverance with ſpeeches of gallantry. But at length, ſeeing her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt too much in her demand, he by an artificial diſcourſe coloured the matter with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, and gave the King a pretext to follow his inclination, by obliging <hi>Mariama</hi> to retain theſe three fair Slaves in her ſervice. It being ſo reſolved then, the King uſed them with a great deal of civility, and having demanded of them what we were unto them? they anſwered, that we were their brothers, and beſought him that we might not be ſeparated from them. As for us, ſeeing we might be underſtood, we humbly requeſted the King to intreat us as free men; and to conſider that we had been driven into <hi>Marocco</hi> by a Tempeſt; that howſoever if he would notwithſtanding have a ranſom of us, we deſired he would be pleaſed to ſet it down, to the end we might ſeek out the means to ſatisfie him. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he anſwered no otherwiſe, but that the next day we ſhould receive his pleaſure; and inſtantly we were conducted to a lodg ng, which was in the outward Court of the Palace, where we had a Guard ſet upon us. In the mean time the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> being moved with the tears and intreaties of theſe three afflicted ones, permitted them to remain with us, on condition that they ſhould ſpend three or four hours of the day at her lodging, praying them not to be grieved, and to hope for all things from her aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>But, Madam, that you may the better comprehend the ſequel of our Hiſtory, I am to relate unto you a part of <hi>Mariama's,</hi> and acquaint you in what eſtate the Court of <hi>Marocco</hi> was at that time. I will not ſtand for all that to tell you by what Artifices, two <hi>Xeriffes,</hi> that is to ſay amongſt them, two holy men, and deſcended of the race of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> invaded the two Kingdoms of <hi>Marocco</hi> and <hi>Taradant;</hi> but I will only tell you, that theſe two <hi>Xeriffes,</hi> though they were brothers, could not content themſelves with the partition they had made of their Conqueſts; and after many breaches of promiſe on either ſide, they came at laſt to Arms. Whil'ſt they were in good terms together, <hi>Hamet,</hi> who was the eldeſt, and to whom the Kingdom of <hi>Marocco</hi> was fallen for his ſhare, had married <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> daughter to <hi>Mahomet</hi> his brother, King of <hi>Sus</hi> or <hi>Taradant,</hi> to <hi>Muley Zidan,</hi> the eldeſt of his ſons; ſo that when the War began between theſe two brothers, the fair and vertuous <hi>Mariama</hi> found her ſelf on the party of her fathers enemy; and whatſoever ſhe could do, it was impoſſible for her to make them change their reſolution. Seeing then that her prayers, her tears, and perſwaſions were all to no purpoſe with her father-in-law <hi>Hamet,</hi> and that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Zidan,</hi> her husband, told her, how he could not but follow him in this War, who had given him birth; that he was not an enemy to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but only an obedient ſon; that it was not for children to ask who were the enemies of thoſe to whom they owed their lives, but only to hazard them againſt whomſoever they were, for the conſervation of the lives of them, who had given them theirs. This wiſe Princeſs ſeeing, I ſay, things in this eſtate, abode
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60144:189"/> in <hi>Marocco,</hi> and without making vows for the victory, either of the one of the other, ſhe wiſhed that their Arms would fall out of their hands, and that Reaſon might be ſtronger in them then ambition. But things went not after this ſort; for after many encounters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kings of <hi>Marocco,</hi> and <hi>Taradant,</hi> had each in their turn had the better and the worſe, the chance of war being fallen in the end on <hi>Hamet,</hi> ſhe ſaw <hi>Muley Zidan</hi> her Husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn almoſt alone of all his whole Army, which had been utterly defeated, and acquaint her with tears in his eyes, that his Father, and a Brother which he had, named <hi>Muley Buaçon,</hi> were priſoners in the hands of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> This vertuous Princeſs hearing this news, had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity enough to weep for the victories of her Father; and when as ſhe ſaw that her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, after he had aſſembled together all the <hi>Alfaquis,</hi> Cavaliers, and Captains that were in <hi>Marocco</hi> to adviſe on that which might be done, found out no expedient which could be commodious for him, ſhe preſented her ſelf unto the Councel, and demanded the permiſſion to go and caſt her ſelf at the feet of <hi>Mahomet</hi> her Father, to endevor the effecting of a peace; or to offer her ſelf, and three children ſhe had, for the ranſom of <hi>Hamet;</hi> or to obtain a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So generous a propoſition was approved of by the whole Aſſembly; and <hi>Muley Zidan</hi> went himſelf to conduct his wife and his children forth of the Gates of the City; yet was h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in ſome trouble to part with her, out of the fear he was in, leſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> knowing how ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhe was beloved of him, ſhould retain her without rendering up his Father, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out harkening to peace. But ſhe aſſured him, that when as ſhe could no longer be uſeful to her Father-in-law, nothing but death alone ſhould keep her from returning back to him again. The voyage of this ſage Princeſs was not fruitleſs; and albeit that her Father was one of the greateſt Politicians in the World, and one of the moſt ambitious Princes on the Earth, yet her Reaſons, her Tears, and her Prayers drew him to grant her the liberty of <hi>Hamet</hi> and <hi>Muley Buaçon,</hi> and by a Treaty, as reaſonable as if <hi>Hamet</hi> had not been a priſoner, they contracted a peace which ſeemed inviolable.</p>
                  <p>But ſcarcely was <hi>Mariama</hi> re-entred into <hi>Marocco</hi> as it were in triumph, after ſhe had brought the King thither again; ſcarcely had <hi>Muley Zidan</hi> her Husband rendred her thanks for ſo brave an action, but that <hi>Hamet</hi> began to aſſemble new forces, and to ſay, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had promiſed in priſon, was not to be kept; and for that effect he went out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> to go and make new Levies himſelf; but at this time the victory fell to the juſter ſide. For during <hi>Hamet</hi>'s abſence, <hi>Mahomet</hi> having been advertiſed of his deſigns, came to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> and made himſelf Maſter of the City, partly by force, and partly alſo by the revolt of ſome, who could not approve of <hi>Hamet</hi>'s changings: So that when he thought to return to <hi>Marocco,</hi> with <hi>Muley Zidan,</hi> who had followed after him with an intent to divert him from the deſign he had to make war, he underſtood that he was a King without a Kingdom; and that the people, who ever follow the victorious party, had acknowledged <hi>Mahomet</hi> for King of <hi>Marocco.</hi> This Prince was ſo mightily ſtrucken with this adventure, that abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things he retired to one, named <hi>Cidy Ben Cecy,</hi> who lived ſolitarily in the Mountains, and paſt amongſt them for a very great and holy perſon. As for <hi>Muley Zidan,</hi> he retired to the King of <hi>Fez</hi> their confederate.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Mariama,</hi> who was in the City when it was taken, carryed by her ordinary generoſity, and fearing leſt ſhe ſhould have been ſuſpected for contributing ſomewhat thereunto, caſt her ſelf at her Fathers feet to obtain leave of him to follow the infortunate party. And when as he refuſed her, ſhe ſuborned one of the Captains that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gates, and accompanyed with two women, and ſome of her ſervants, ſhe got out one night, and went to <hi>Cidy Ben Cecy</hi>'s retirement. This action ſo touched <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s heart, as it carryed him once again to treat with his Brother, but it was upon condition, that he ſhould not re-enter into <hi>Marocco,</hi> becauſe he had promiſed ſo much to the inhabitants, who feared to be ill-intreated by him.</p>
                  <p>But not to prolong this diſcourſe any further, you ſhall underſtand that <hi>Hamet</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the War four or five times, and that ſo often <hi>Mariama</hi> obtained his liberty, and always followed his and her Husbands fortune. Howbeit in the end <hi>Mahomet,</hi> after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Kingdom of <hi>Fez,</hi> took him in the laſt War, and committed him to cloſe priſon, with four of his children, and three of <hi>Mariama</hi>'s, becauſe he accuſed <hi>Muley Zidan</hi> her
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60144:190"/> Husband, for having ſuccored the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> whil'ſt he made war upon him: And the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Zidan</hi> having been taken, loſt his life, by the command of him, whoſe daughter he had marryed. True indeed it is, that it was by the counſel of <hi>Aly,</hi> who afterwards was <hi>Abdal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s favorite, and in the abſence of <hi>Mariama,</hi> who at that time was not with her Father. <hi>In fine,</hi> not to aggravate the ſorrow of this excellent Princeſs, <hi>Mahomet</hi> dyed a little while after, and <hi>Abdalla</hi> the eldeſt of his children ſucceeded him; having ordained by his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that after him the ſecond of his ſons ſhould ſucceed, and in order all his other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without any pretence to be made by any of <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s children to the Crowns of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, Fez,</hi> and <hi>Taradant,</hi> as long as their Uncles lived. At ſuch time as <hi>Mahomet</hi> dyed, <hi>Abdalla</hi> was not at <hi>Marocco,</hi> ſo that when the news of his death arrived there, <hi>Aly,</hi> who commanded in the City, and was <hi>Viſier</hi> of the Kingdom, which is the next dignity to the King, fearing leſt the people ſhould revolt, and ſhould draw <hi>Hamet</hi> and <hi>Mariama</hi>'s children out of priſon, to ſet them on the Throne which appertained to them, carryed by an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate zeal, and an extream cruelty, cauſed the infortunate <hi>Hamet,</hi> and his children, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Mariama</hi>'s, to be put to death, for the aſſuring of the Crown to <hi>Abdalla,</hi> whoſe favorite he would be, as he had been <hi>Mahomet's.</hi> And truly it was not hard for him to be ſo; for whereas this man was very great in riches, moſt mighty in friends, of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courage, having a great deal of prudence and wit, and much more ambition, there would have been folly, and no little hazard, for whomſoever would have enterprized to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdalla,</hi> though grieved with that which <hi>Aly</hi> had done, yet named it an exceſs of zeal and affection, rather then inhumanity; and continuing him in his Commands, committed unto him almoſt the whole ſway of his Kingdoms. But in ſome ſort to repair this cruelty, he took care to dry up the tears of the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> inforced her to return to the Court, made her to be reverenced as the Queen of all his <hi>States,</hi> would have perſwaded her that <hi>Aly</hi> was not altogether culpable of the death of <hi>Hamet</hi> and her children, and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act no other thing of her, but to live in good terms with <hi>Aly.</hi> This Princeſs, who was no leſs prudent then vertuous, made as if ſhe believed that which the King her Brother told her, albeit in her heart ſhe bare an irreconciliable hatred to <hi>Aly.</hi> And indeed ſhe lived ſo well with him, without doing any thing for all that unworthy of her great minde, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the conſideration of her Brother, and her own vertue, had made her forget, that <hi>Aly</hi> had counſelled the death of her Husband, and had cauſed her Father-in-law, and her children to be killed. But you ſhall perceive by the ſequel of this Hiſtory, that ſhe had other manner of deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Behold then, Madam, the eſtate wherein the Court of <hi>Marocco</hi> was at ſuch time as we were driven thither by tempeſt. <hi>Abdalla</hi> was peaceable in his Eſtates, the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> was very powerful with him, and <hi>Aly</hi> ſhared with her in <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s heart. I think that after this you will the leſs marvel, when you ſhall come to know that this vertuous Princeſs ſet her ſelf ſo ſtrongly and ſo readily to protect us, in regard ſhe was carryed thereunto, both by her own vertue, and the hate ſhe bare to <hi>Aly,</hi> as you ſhall underſtand by the ſequel of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But to come to that which touches us directly, I am to tell you, that whether <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia</hi>'s extream affliction had rendered her eyes leſs powerful then they uſed to be, or <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida</hi>'s negligence had taken off ſome of her charms, or that my ſiſter, having a complexion not ſo clear as her fellows, was the more ſuitable to that of the Country, it was ſhe that made <hi>Abdalla</hi> and <hi>Aly</hi> her Slaves; and who by conſequence was the cauſe that we were ſo too.</p>
                  <p>You have promiſed, ſaid <hi>Horatio</hi> interrupting him, to be a faithful Hiſtorian; wherefore, without digreſſing from your ſubject, relate onely the effects of <hi>Hipolita</hi>'s beauty, and not eſtabliſh your ſelf the judg thereof. The Marquis could not forbear laughing at this diſcourſe, no more then <hi>Sophronia</hi> and <hi>Leonida,</hi> nor <hi>Hipolita</hi> bluſhing, and all out of different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions: but at length after ſome civilities had paſt betwixt them, <hi>Doria</hi> continued his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this ſort. <hi>Hipolita</hi> then having ſeemed beautiful, both to the King, and to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, they had both of them a deſign not to give liberty to a perſon, who had already ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what engaged theirs: But whereas this firſt ſenſe of love was not yet very ſtrong in their ſoul, they ſaid nothing of it to one another, and onely reſolved together, that we ſhould be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Slaves; but whereas ill fortune had brought us to <hi>Marocco,</hi> and that we were not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60144:190"/> their Enemies, but becauſe we were Chriſtians, therefore we ſhould be treated very gently, yea and hope given us that in time we might obtain our liberty. This reſolution taken, all our Soldiers and Mariners were the next day committed to ſafe cuſtody, without any other ill uſage offered unto them; and for us, they contented themſelves with leaving us under the guard they had formerly aſſigned us, with this difference nevertheleſs, that we were ſeparated from <hi>Sophronia, Leonida,</hi> and <hi>Hipolita;</hi> for it was <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s abſolute pleaſure, that they ſhould abide in the ſervice of the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> and that they ſhould lie in her lodgings; but with this grace for us, that we ſhould be permitted to go ſometimes and ſee them, or they to come and viſit us. This extraordinary favor having been granted to us, againſt the cuſtom of the Country, by the goodneſs of <hi>Mariama,</hi> whom theſe new Slaves always found ready to render them all kinde of good offices. It is certain that this ſeparation was grievous unto us, and ſeeing the terms wherein we ſtood, we were almoſt ſorry that we had not ſuffred ſhipwrack, at leaſt-wiſe me-thought I obſerved ſuch like apprehenſions in the mindes of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo:</hi> But as for the Marquis, it is to be ſpoken for his glory, that never man was ſo ſoon comforted as he, and I was not a little ſurprized, to hear him ſay laughing, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour after we were returned from conducting the perſons, who were ſo deer unto us, to the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi>'s lodgings, that the <hi>Affricans</hi> Love could tell how to uſe his how better, then he of <hi>Europe;</hi> it being very true, ſaid he, that he had never been ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtrucken to the heart, as he had lately been by the charms of a ſiſter of the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> who was called <hi>Lela Mahabit,</hi> onely with ſeeing her at a window.</p>
                  <p>For me, ſaid the Marquis interrupting him, who had neither Siſter nor Miſtreſs to grieve for, nor was afflicted but out of a ſenſe of friendſhip, I am not to be blamed, if, to render my ſelf more like unto thoſe with whom I converſed, I ſuffered my ſelf to be ſurprized with the paſſion which poſſeſſed their Souls. If I be always interrupted in this manner, ſaid <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will be hard for me to relate this day that which you deſire to know of me. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> finding that <hi>Doria</hi> had Reaſon, made all the company paſs their word that they would not ſpeak any more until he had ended their Hiſtory; ſo that every one keeping ſilence, and <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> having renewed her attention, <hi>Doria</hi> proſecuted his diſcourſe in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>Theſe new Slaves were no ſooner come to the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi>'s lodgings, but <hi>Abdalla,</hi> who viſited them very often, repaired thither, accompanyed with <hi>Aly.</hi> And whereas he found her with them, and that therefore they would out of reſpect have withdrawn, he would not permit it, telling them that the name of Slave, which he had impoſed upon them, was rather an artifice to retain them about the Princeſs his ſiſter, then a deſign to keep them in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. This complement was ſeconded by another which <hi>Aly</hi> uſed to them, and with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere proteſtation made to them by <hi>Mariama</hi> for the treating of them as her ſiſters, rather then as her Slaves. This ſecond view yet more augmented the love, which the King of <hi>Marocco</hi> and <hi>Aly</hi> already bore to <hi>Hipolita;</hi> and whereas <hi>Aly</hi> was cunning and dextrous, and had out of a ſenſe of ambition for a long time before taken great care to obſerve all <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he quickly perceived that the beauty of <hi>Hipolita</hi> had touched his heart, and that his Maſter was his Rival. And whereas he knew very well that Love, no more then Royalty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures not any companion, he reſolved to conceal from the King the deſign which he had in his head. It was not long, before his ſuſpicions were fully cleared; for <hi>Abdalla</hi> being become paſſionately in love, and fearing leſt if he ſhould talk too often with <hi>Hipolita,</hi> his ſiſter, to whom he carryed a great reſpect, would come to know his intentions, he opened his heart wholly to <hi>Aly,</hi> diſcovered his paſſion unto him, conjured him to finde out the means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with it, who had cauſed it. <hi>Aly,</hi> as we underſtood afterwards, teſtified a great deal of joy unto him, for that he being fallen in love, as he ſaid, with one of thoſe Slaves, he had been ſo happy as not to prove his Rival. The King demanded of him then, whether it were ſo that he loved any of them? and the other anſwered him with a falſe confidence, that <hi>Leonida</hi> had touched his heart. That which obliged him to this lye, was his belief, that by this mean the King would never be jealous of him, nor would fear his falling in love with <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita,</hi> being perſwaded that his affection was engaged otherwhere; and indeed the matter fell out as he imagined. The King gave him the conduct of his Love, as well as that of his Eſtates; commanded him always to follow him whenſoever he went to the Princeſs <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> and not to loſe any occaſion of ſpeaking to <hi>Hipolita</hi> concerning him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, as if Fortune would give a particular perſecution to each of theſe three
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60144:191"/> fair Slaves, a younger Brother of <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s, named <hi>Abdelcadar,</hi> became deſperately in love with <hi>Sophronia.</hi> For the reſt of us, except it were the Marquis, we had no new paſſion; and miſhap in this encounter, appeared not to us at firſt, but in the ſemblance of good fortune. The King ſent to viſit us with preſents, and many times made us come to his lodgings for to entertain him. <hi>Aly</hi> reſorted to us himſelf, and aſſured us of his protection: We had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the liberty to ſee and ſpeak with our ſiſters, or to ſay better, our Miſtreſſes; for in theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, love always prevailed over friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In fine,</hi> the greateſt of our unquietneſſes was, that we could not foreſee the end of our preſent felicities, nor divine wherefore they treated us ſo favorably, and yet would not deliver us. Howbeit we were not long without diſcovering it, for the King's and <hi>Aly</hi>'s love ſtill augmenting, whereas gallantry ſeems to be natural to all the <hi>Moors,</hi> they were willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Hipolita</hi> to her former joy, before they would ſpeak to her of their paſsion.

But in all theſe encounters <hi>Aly</hi> ſo carryed the matter, as all the parties, whereof he was the Head, were, both braver, and more magnificent, then that of others, without the Kings ever ſuſpecting any thing of his true intent, becauſe his minde was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with the opinion, that it was <hi>Leonida</hi> he was in love withall, and not <hi>Hipolita.</hi> And ſurely he ſhould have been very melancholique, that could not have taken pleaſure in theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, it being certain, that nothing is ſeen which is more agreeable even in <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for dancing. For whereas, ſince the deſolation of <hi>Granado,</hi> many perſons of quality retired to <hi>Fez, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Marocco,</hi> though the remembrance of their misfortunes ought to have made them renounce all manner of delights, yet their deſire to pleaſe <hi>Abdalla</hi> who protected them, cauſed them to be preſent at all theſe feaſts.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60144:191"/> effect of his obedience to <hi>Abdalla,</hi> and not as a matter he approved of. He told her then, that he had ſuch a particular eſteem of her, as he would rather expoſe himſelf to the hazard of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his life and his fortune, then to that of diſpleaſing her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In fine,</hi> after a preparation long enough, and when as he believed that he had given ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient good impreſſions of his vertue to <hi>Hipolita,</hi> he told her that her beauty had touched the heart of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> and that he had commanded him to acquaint her with his love; but, ſaid he unto her with a ſeeming ſincerity, whereas you can never be but his Slave, Heaven ſhield me from contributing ought to ſo bad a deſign; contrarily, I will do my uttermoſt to hinder ſuch a misfortune; and that you may furniſh me with means to ſerve you, make known to the King, added he, if he happens to ſpeak with you, that I have acquitted my ſelf of the commiſſion which he gave me; in the mean time aſſure your ſelf that there is not any thing which I will not undertake for your ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hipolita</hi> was ſtrangely ſurprized with this diſcourſe, for coming to conſider all <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s liberalities, and the manner wherein he had lived with her for a good while before, ſhe made no qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ally ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and miſtruſtful, ſhe doubted of <hi>Aly</hi>'s ſincerity in ſome things; howbeit ſhe anſwered civilly enough to the offers he had made her; but for ſo much as regarded the Kings love, ſhe ſpake to him with ſo much firmneſs, as he ſeemed to be very blank at it. It was not becauſe he deſired ſhe ſhould accept of <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s love, but ſeeing in what manner ſhe refuſed the Kings affection, he feared leſt when he ſhould come to diſcover his own, he ſhould be worſe intreated. And whereas <hi>Hipolita</hi> perceived his unquietneſs; for what reaſon, ſaid ſhe unto him, are you afflicted to ſee me reſolved to oppoſe my ſelf with all my power againſt an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you ſeem not to approve of? It is, anſwered <hi>Aly,</hi> with as much cunning as malice, becauſe knowing by your diſcourſe, how much that which I have uſed to you hath troubled your mind, I cannot chuſe but grieve for that the King hath pick'd out to perſecute you, the only man in the world that honors you moſt: But believe, fair <hi>Hipolita,</hi> continued he, that this unjuſt love touches me as much as you, and that there is not any thing which I will not do to deliver you from it. After this <hi>Aly</hi> quitted her, and left her in ſuch an unquietneſs, as the like was ſcarcely ever heard of. Not only the Kings affection afflicted her; not only the ſadneſs, which ſhe had obſerved in <hi>Aly</hi>'s face, troubled her; not only the incertainty wherein ſhe was whether ſhe ſhould diſcover <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s love to the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> diſquieted her; but an odd and altogether extraordinary jealouſie put her mind upon the rack. She did not complain of <hi>Horatio</hi>'s looking on any other perſon; ſhe did not accuſe him of infidelity, but ſhe was jealous becauſe he was not jealous: For when as <hi>Aly</hi> talked to her, ſhe had marked how <hi>Horatio</hi>'s eyes were ſtill fixed on her, and albeit he had ſeen that man entertain her a long time, yet had he not appeared the more unquiet for it. And as it is the cuſtom of paſſionate perſons to aggravate things, according to the apprehenſions which they have, ſo <hi>Hipolita</hi> had the injuſtice to believe, that her Lover muſt needs perceive the Kings love, which ſhe her ſelf had not known. If he loved me ardently, ſaid ſhe (for ſhe declared it unto us afterwards) the fear of loſing me would have made him fear all things; he would have taken notice of the Kings civilities; his liberalities would have been ſuſpected unto him; I ſhould have ſeen ſome unquietneſs in his eyes, when as <hi>Aly</hi> talked ſo earneſtly to me: <hi>in fine,</hi> concluded ſhe in her heart, either he loves me not, or he loves me but a little; and if he loves me but a little, he loves me not at all, ſince love never endures any mediocrity.</p>
                  <p>Whil'ſt ſhe reaſoned in this manner, <hi>Aly,</hi> who d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rent manner. He was not jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of <hi>Leonida,</hi> but he was vext to think that <hi>Aly</hi> was amorous of her. He did not fear that ſhe would be unfaithful to him, but he was angry that another was paſſionate for her; it being his humor, as I conceive, that the perſon whom he loves ſhould never ſee any but him, nor ſhould be ſeen of any but him. As for me, that am of a contrary mind; that would have all the Earth raiſe up altars to my Miſtreſs; that cannot be jealous no more then <hi>Horatio;</hi> that places all my felicity in having Rivals, to the end I may poſſeſs the glory of being better intreated then they, and may no longer doubt, but that I am loved as well out of choyce, as out of inclination; I ſaw <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> as long as this Aſſembly laſted, employ all his addreſs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60144:192"/> to pleaſe the fair <hi>Sophronia,</hi> without being troubled at it; but contrarily I beheld with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the admiration which her beauty put him into, as well as all the reſt of the company, and it ſeemed unto me, that in commending her, they commended my judgment, and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my glory.</p>
                  <p>Behold, Madam, in what ſort this Aſſembly ended; The King retired with a great deal of impatience to know what anſwer <hi>Hipolita</hi> had given to <hi>Aly;</hi> this falſe Confident very ſorry for having encountred with ſo much firmneſs in my ſiſters mind; <hi>Sophronia</hi> ſufficiently diſpleaſed with <hi>Abdelcader</hi>'s complacency; <hi>Leonida</hi> in a humor of laughing at the affection which <hi>Aly</hi> ſeemed to bear her; <hi>Alphonſo</hi> netled with having a Rival, though he would not acknowledg it to us; the Marqueſs exceedingly contented with having a Miſtreſs; <hi>Lela Mahabid</hi> well ſatisfied with the Marqueſs his gallantry; <hi>Horatio</hi> with a mind indifferent enough for all that had paſt; and I ſufficiently contented in our misfortune, and even with a ſecret ſenſe of joy, to ſee that the beauty of <hi>Sophronia</hi> was ſo perfect, as ſhe made her ſelf be adored of all Nations.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> who hath a quick and piercing wit, perceived all the divers intereſts of this Aſſembly: and though ſhe could not diſcover them perfectly, yet knew ſhe that the King was in ſome paſſion; that <hi>Aly</hi> was not exempted from it; that <hi>Abdelcader</hi> her bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her did not hate <hi>Sophronia;</hi> and that <hi>Lela Mahabid</hi> was too civil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Slave. This wiſe Princeſs reſolved for all that, not to make any ſhew of all theſe things, till ſhe was more certain of them; but it was not long before ſhe was deared therein. For my ſiſter being retired with her companions, and having acquainted them with <hi>Aly</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, they reſolved to advertiſe the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> of it, and abſolutely to confide in her vertue. <hi>Sophronia</hi> was notwithſtanding of the opinion, to ask counſel of us firſt; ſo that the next morning, according to the permiſſion they had for it, they ſent for us. And when as <hi>Sophronia</hi> had propounded the matter unto us, and that I began already to give my advice, Let <hi>Horatio</hi> ſpeak firſt, ſaid <hi>Hipolita</hi> unto me, with precipitation enough; for if to give good counſel one hath need of a quiet mind, it may well be ſaid that he is in ſuch an eſtate as he ought to be, to counſel us as we ſhould be. Were it true, replyed <hi>Horatio</hi> mightily ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that I had a quiet mind, the manner wherewithall you have ſpoken is enough to trouble it in ſuch ſort, as to render me incapable of counſelling others. Since your reſt is ſo dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, anſwered ſhe, as you even ſeek a pretext not to aſsiſt afflicted perſons with your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, leave us at leaſtwiſe to think of what we have to do. <hi>Horatio</hi> ſeeing her ſo bitter, would not anſwer her out of prudence and reſpect, for fear leſt her fantaſtical humor ſhould appear too viſibly unto us. As for me, who comprehended nothing in this diſcourſe, I ſaid unto my ſiſter half laughing, that I believed the King of <hi>Marocco</hi>'s love had poſſeſſed her with pride, rather then with melancholy, if ſhe continued ſpeaking in that faſhion. But in the end we reſolved, that theſe four Slaves ſhould abſolutely confide in the Princeſs <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> for fear leſt if they ſhould not advertiſe her of the truth of the matter, ſhe might have cauſe to think, ſhould ſhe diſcover it ſome other way, that it was not diſpleaſing to them, ſince they made a myſtery of it. We conceived that from her alone they were to hope for their protection, and their liberty, and conſequently that it was requiſite they ſhould make all their vertue known to this Princeſs; who out of ſympathy and conformity, would without doubt be always carried to ſerve them.</p>
                  <p>After we had a long time reaſoned of all theſe things; after that <hi>Sophronia</hi> had acquainted us with her new Conqueſt, and <hi>Leonida</hi> with that which ſhe thought ſhe had made; after, I ſay, we had ſpoken of all this in general, <hi>Horatio,</hi> who deſired to know what he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of, ſeparated <hi>Hipolita</hi> dextrouſly from us, and having led her to a window, where ſhe leaned, he conjured her to tell him what had obliged her to ſpeak with ſo much bitterneſs unto him, (at leaſtwiſe he related it ſo unto us,) I know full well, ſaid he unto her, that I am not faulty; but I do not know of what crime I am accuſed: Be ſo good unto me then as to acquaint me with it, that I may juſtifie my ſelf; but if you will have me ſpeak like an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, although I be none, let me know what fault I have committed, to the end I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me of it, and amend it. You may peradventure do the former, anſwered ſhe, but it is impoſſible for you to do the other. I have a long time known, that there would be ſome injuſtice in accuſing you of an inſenſibility, which you cannot chuſe but have; howbeit I cannot alſo chuſe but complain of my hard fortune, in having a mind ſo ſenſible for a man,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60144:192"/> that is ſo little himſelf. The more you complain, ſaid <hi>Horatio</hi> unto her, the leſs do I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend of what fault I am accuſed; for to ſay that the beautiful <hi>Hipolita</hi> does not touch my heart ſenſibly, and that ſhe alone makes not up my felicity, is a thing without all likelyhood. You have reaſon, ſaid ſhe unto him with a bitter ſmile; <hi>Hipolita</hi> can do ſomething upon your felicity, but ſhe can do nothing upon your misfortune: She can ſometimes with a favorable look, or with her diſcourſes, give you happy moments, but ſhe can never with her coldneſs, or the love that ſhe ſhews to others, beget any ſadneſs in you: verily, continued ſhe, you are the happieſt Lover that ever was; nothing diſpleaſes you, nothing moleſts you; neither fear nor jealouſie trouble you; you hope without unquietneſs; you deſire without impatience, and of all the thoughts which Love inſpires, you know none without doubt, but thoſe that lead to joy. You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret all things, as you ſay, to the advantage of the perſon beloved; but to ſpeak more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, it is to the diſadvantage of your love: For whoſoever loves truly, can never hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo aſſured of the perſon whom he loves, but that fear will be ſtronger in him then hope; now for your part, you hope all things, and fear nothing. It is certain, ſaid <hi>Horatio</hi> unto her, that you oftentimes reduce me to an eſtate of fearing nothing, and of having recourſe unto hope to comfort me. For <hi>in fine,</hi> whereas the greateſt of misfortunes is to ſee you in choller, I behold my ſelf ſo many times expoſed thereunto, that I have nothing elſe to fear. No, no, ſaid <hi>Hipolita</hi> unto him, you are yet more ingenuous then ſo; my very choller gives you joy; you regard it as a mark of my affection; and thus making profit of all things, you are never unhappy. Might it pleaſe Heaven, ſaid he unto her, that you ſpake true! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to me, added ſhe interrupting him, that if I had ſaid nothing to you of the long conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which I had yeſterday with <hi>Aly,</hi> whether you would have ſuſpected any thing of it. Any other but you would have been troubled at it, continued ſhe, and whereas love renders the mind clear-ſighted, you would have imagined ſomething of the truth. But as for you, doubtleſs you believed that he entertained me with the Government of the King of <hi>Marocco</hi>'s State; that policy was the object of our converſation, whil'ſt you could in the mean time look without unquietneſs upon the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid,</hi> becauſe ſhe danced with a good grace. Are theſe, rigorous <hi>Hipolita,</hi> ſaid <hi>Horatio</hi> unto her, all the crimes which I have committed? Have I done nothing but ſee you talking with <hi>Aly,</hi> without divining what he ſaid unto you, and without afflicting my ſelf at it? No, anſwered ſhe, you have done nothing elſe; but this indifferency, or to ſay better, this inſenſibility, and this ſtupid love ſo vexes me, as in the ſtate whereunto it hath reduced my mind for a long time together, I had rather ſee you deſperately in love with another, then to ſee you ſo quiet: for either the ſpight of your change would ſet me at reſt; or if I had not reſolution enough for that, I ſhould ſay in flattering my ſelf, he will come out of his error, he will repent him of his inconſtancy, and ſince he can tell how to love, he may be capable of returning and repenting, and of having as much affection for me, as he hath for another. But in the caſe wherin I ſee you at this preſent, you wil be always inſenſible and always happy, and I always unfortunate. That cannot be, anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> my deſtiny and yours are not ſeparated ſo eaſily. But, amiable <hi>Hipolita,</hi> why wil you not have me live innocently, why will you have me render my ſelf faulty, in ſuſpecting you amiſs? Why will you have me make my ſelf unhappy voluntarily, and abandoning Reaſon, form monſters to my ſelf to combat withall? and why will you not on the contrary have me confide in your vertue, rely on your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and without rendring me infortunate, ſuffer me to be in ſome reſt? Would you know, ſaid <hi>Hipolita</hi> unto him, why I will not have it ſo, it is becauſe I do not ſeek in you for a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a Philoſopher, but for a Lover. Love hath a Reaſon, which is wholly particular unto it; reaſonable perſons, who are touched with this paſsion, never abandon Vertue for it, but withall they do not follow that ſevere Reaſon, which will have one receive with an equal temper, both good and bad fortune. Love ought to be ſtronger then Reaſon; it doth not deſtroy it, but it troubles it. I bluſh, <hi>Horatio,</hi> at that which I ſay, and at the grief I am in, for that if I am to know theſe things, it hath not been rather by your actions, then by mine own experience, that I have underſtood them. You ought to have taught me, that love is ſuſpicious, impatient, unquiet, and curious; that it wiſhes for that which it hath not; that it feareth to loſe that which it poſſeſſeth; you ought to have learnt me, that none of the actions of the perſon beloved can be indifferent; that ſhe alone ought to be more conſiderable, then all the world beſides; and that the only deſire to pleaſe her, and the fear to offend her, ſhould make a Lover act. By this reaſon, anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> I ſhould not dare to accuſe you,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60144:193"/> no not when you had given me occaſion to complain, being perſwaded that all thoſe words of cruel, unjuſt, and inexorable, ought not to be ſaid to a worthy perſon, but in ſongs, and if it were poſsible for me to be angry with you, reſpect ſhould force me to conceal it. You are in an error, replyed ſhe, choller and jealouſie are the true marks of love, and provided that one does not continue in them, one never offends the perſon whom one loves; but you ſpeak ſo, becauſe you know not how to love. Nay but I ſpeak in his ſort, anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know how to love well, and that I reſpect you. Reſpect, replyed <hi>Hipolita,</hi> can be but a mark of eſteem, and not a mark of love: And tell me, I pray you, by what way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you to teſtifie yours unto me. In proteſting to you, anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> that you are all my felicity; in abſolutely remitting unto you the conduct of my fortune; and in aſſuring you that I would loſe my life with joy for your ſervice. One may do all theſe things out of eſteem, and out of generoſity, replyed ſhe, but one can never be jealous without love; all other paſsions may receive interpretations, but this ſame leaves no room to doubt of the cauſe of it; and jealouſie is the only aſſured mark of this paſsion. If I could ceaſe from eſteeming of you, replyed <hi>Horatio,</hi> I ſhould be jealous, I ſhould be unquiet. Say, anſwered ſhe lifting up her voyce, and quitting him, that if you could ceaſe from being inſenſible, you ſhould be a Lover. She ſpake this ſo loud, as <hi>Sophronia, Leonida,</hi> the Marqueſs, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and I, heard h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thereupon we retired to our lodging, and theſe three fair Slaves to the Princeſs <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s; where after the firſt civilities they beſought her to give them a particular audience. <hi>Mariama,</hi> having granted them their demand, commanded her women to leave her alone; which was no ſooner done, but the fair <hi>Sophronia,</hi> who had in charge to ſpeak in the name of all the three, requeſted her to remember the promiſe ſhe had made to protect them; and then ſhe related unto her the diſcourſe which <hi>Aly</hi> had uſed to <hi>Hipolita</hi> and <hi>Leonida:</hi> but not able to obtain ſo much confidence from her modeſty, as to tell her withall, that <hi>Abdelca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had teſtified a great deal of affection to her, my ſiſter acquainted the Princeſs with the conqueſt that <hi>Sophronia</hi> had made. <hi>Mariama</hi> being very much ſatisfied with their freedom and their vertue, redoubled the care and good-will which ſhe had for them; and to ſhew that ſhe put as much confidence in their diſcretion, as they done in hers: and to let them ſee alſo, how much intereſt ſhe had to oppoſe all the bad deſigns of <hi>Aly,</hi> ſhe recounted all his adventures unto them, namely, all that I imparted to you at the beginning of this Hiſtory: And thereupon aſſured them, that whatſoever came from a ſpirit ſo artificial as <hi>Aly</hi>'s, was ever to be ſuſpected. She told them moreover, that whereas he did always work with cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was always to be delt with in the ſame manner: that to that effect, great care was to be taken to keep him from diſcovering, that they had acquainted her either with the Kings love, or his; that it was likewiſe requiſite, that <hi>Hipolita</hi> ſhould ſeem to place ſome confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in that falſe generoſity, which he had feigned to have in ſpeaking to her of the Kings love. For, ſaid <hi>Mariama</hi> unto them, I know <hi>Aly,</hi> he would never have delt in that ſort with <hi>Hipolita,</hi> had not ſome paſſion, more powerful then his malice, carryed him thereunto. Hitherto he hath never contraried the King in any thing; hitherto he hath affected a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all his will, and an exterior fidelity, which hath not permitted me as yet to revenge the miſchiefs he hath done me. Nevertheleſs I ſee ſomething in his heart, ſince the time that I have obtained of my ſelf to ſpeak with him oftner then I uſed to do, which puts me in hope that I ſhall finde the means for it. <hi>In fine,</hi> believe it, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Hipolita,</hi> that <hi>Aly</hi> hath not declared the Kings love unto you, and promiſed to protect you againſt him, without ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reaſon that induces him thereunto, and without ſome particular intereſt. But for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, we muſt diſſemble as well as he, and not ſpeak ſo ſeverely of the love which he ſaith the King bears you, that we may ſee what he will be at. <hi>Leonida,</hi> for her part, muſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to diſcover his deſigns; and <hi>Sophronia,</hi> carrying her ſelf according to her humor and her vertue, will no doubt puniſh <hi>Abdelcader</hi> rigorouſly enough, for ſuffering himſelf to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60144:193"/> ſurprized by the ſplendor of her beauty; howbeit I will take care that he ſhall no longer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune her. In the mean time, continued ſhe, fear no violence, unleſs it be from <hi>Aly;</hi> for touching the King, I know that he hath ſome reſpect to my perſon, and doth carefully ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to make me forget the cruelties which <hi>Aly</hi> hath done, under the pretext of aſſuring the Crown unto him. And grant alſo that the wickedneſs of this man ſhould prove contageous to the King, be aſſured that I will never abandon you, and will hazard all things to keep you from having any violence offered unto you.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fair Slaves gave her thanks for a diſcourſe that was ſo advantageous unto them; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her vertue and her generoſity; lamented the misfortunes that had arrived unto her; deteſted the cruelty of <hi>Aly:</hi> and making an exchange of their own ſorrows, it might have been ſaid that <hi>Mariama</hi> felt their miſeries more then her own; and that theſe fair Slaves, who were no leſs generous, nor leſs ſenſible then ſhe, had as much ſenſe of her paſt fortunes as of their preſent miſhaps.</p>
                  <p>After that ſo ſad a converſation had laſted ſome time, and that out of the compaſsion, which they had one of another, they had in ſome ſort mitigated their griefs, the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> told them ſmiling, how it would not be juſt, that whil'ſt ſhe was thinking of their protection, one of their Troop ſhould undertake to revenge <hi>Hipolita</hi> of the Kings love, with another love; deſiring them to advertiſe the Slave, which danced with ſo good a grace, that the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid</hi> was her ſiſter; becauſe ſhe believed, that either he knew not ſo much, or that he had forgotten it. <hi>Sophronia</hi> perceiving by <hi>Mariama</hi>'s ſpeech, that ſhe meant the Marquis; and that ſhe alſo had taken notice of his inclination to the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid,</hi> thought it was beſt to acquaint her with his humor, to the end ſhe might not be offended if he continued the gallantry he had begun. <hi>Sophronia</hi> then drew the Marquis his picture ſo agreeably, and ſo advantageouſly for him, as the Princeſs told her that ſhe was very glad of the conqueſt her ſiſter had made, and that ſhe might in ſome ſort ſhare with her there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The firſt time he was there, I remember that we brought him thither with ſome kinde of repugnancy; for he had underſtood from <hi>Sophronia</hi> her ſelf, in what manner ſhe had ſpoken of him. It is not, ſaid he unto us, becauſe I am angry that <hi>Sophronia</hi> hath ſpoken the truth; but it is becauſe I do not feel my ſelf in a diſpoſition to make it appear by experience, that I am as inconſtant as ſhe hath deſcribed me: it being very certain, that I am perſwaded I cannot love any think here but the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this little vexation the Marquis was brought to <hi>Mariama</hi>'s lodging, where all thoſe fair Slaves were preſent, as well as the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid,</hi> who received him with a great deal of civility. At firſt <hi>Mariama</hi> commended his addreſs, and rememb'ring how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably he had danced in the laſt Aſſemblies, ſhe marvelled how he could in ſo ſhort a ſpace ſurmount all the <hi>Moors</hi> in gallantry and a good grace. <hi>The Moors,</hi> ſaid he unto her, Madam, <hi>have not had ſo good a Maſter as I.</hi> And when as <hi>Mariama</hi> had demanded of him, who he was? he anſwered her, that Love had taught him all that he knew; it being moſt ſure, as he ſaid, that without him he had been the ignoranteſt of all men. For, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, the ſole deſire to pleaſe the perſon whom I loved hath taught me all that I know. If that be ſo, anſwered <hi>Mariama,</hi> and that which hath been told me of you be true, you ſhould be one of the moſt univerſally knowing men in the world, ſince by that reaſon, the diverſity of perſons whom you have loved, ſhould have taught you a wonderful diverſity of things.</p>
                  <p>Truly, Madam, you have Reaſon, replyed he, but that which makes me know them but ſuperficially, is, becauſe I have ſtayd ſo little a while in one ſchool, as I have had no more leaſure then to learn to ſpeak a little of things, without any perfect knowledg of them. The firſt perſon, of whom I was enamored, loved valor, and that was the cauſe why I took care not to appear cowardly. She that touched my heart next loved muſique, and inſtantly I learned to ſing, to play on the Lute and the Gittern. Another, placing her greateſt delight in reading of verſes, inſpired me with the deſire of making ſome. One of my Miſtreſſes, loving <hi>Romanzes</hi> above any thing elſe, poſſeſſed me with the deſire to furniſh the ſubject of one with mine own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60144:194"/> I learned alſo to be fit for all compliance; I became a Painter, an Aſtrologer, and a Mathematician: Love made me learn languages; by him I grew many times eloquent, liberal, diſcreet, and pleaſing; <hi>in fine,</hi> I do not know a vertue, for which I am not indebted to this noble paſsion.</p>
                  <p>I profeſs, ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> that this is the fineſt way of commending ones ſelf that ever was heard of. But, ſaid ſhe to the Marquis, how comes it to paſs, that in ſo little a time as you have been here, you have ſo perfectly attained to that, which the <hi>Granadins,</hi> who are our maſters in gallantry, are ſo long a learning? for, as you ſay your ſelf, there are things which you underſtand but ſuperficially, becauſe your love to thoſe that affected them was not long enough. It is, Madam, anſwered he, becauſe I have at this preſent a greater deſire to pleaſe, then ever I had in all my life.</p>
                  <p>She that hath given you this deſire, ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid</hi> unto him, ſhould have a great deal of merit, or ſhould be very much obliged to you. She hath ſo many excellent qualities, replyed the Marquis, as I may ſay, that in this illuſtrious perſon I love all thoſe whom I have loved in all my life-time: it being moſt certain, that I have never admired any thing in all the others, whom I have ſerved, which I do not finde yet more eminently in her whom now I adore. She is wonderfully fair; ſhe hath a ſpirit as full of brightneſs, as her eyes are of light; and there is ſeen in her whole perſon, a charm ſo powerful and ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that it is impoſſible to conſerve ſo much reaſon, as to remember that one ought not to have any other then veneration for her; one muſt of neceſſity give place to love; ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inſpire other thoughts; and not working like ordinary beauties, which makes one paſs from admiration to eſteem, and from eſteem to love, ſhe renders her ſelf at the firſt inſtant abſolute Miſtreſs of all their ſouls that behold her. One cannot have indifferent thoughts for her; one muſt, either not ſee her, or adore her: and from the very firſt moment that I beheld her, I had all at once both admiration, eſteem, and love. I was no longer mine own, I was abſolutely hers; and though I know full well that I am unworthy of this honor, yet can I not imagine that I am faulty. It ſeems to me alſo (at leaſt-wiſe I flatter my ſelf with this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) that by a particular priviledg, and to render her conqueſts the more illuſtrious, ſhe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies all the hearts which ſhe enflames; that ſhe darts forth a beam of that divinity which I adore in her, and therewith illuminates them that come neer her; that in making her vertues known, ſhe communicates a part of them; and that one is no ſooner her Slave, but he is worthy to command others.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid,</hi> not able to forbear from bluſhing at the Marquis his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, would at leaſtwiſe make a gallantry of it. I leave you to judg, ſaid ſhe unto him, how much you would make your Miſtreſſes modeſty to ſuffer, if ſhe were here, ſince I could not chuſe but change colour at this exceſſive praiſe, though I have no part in it. I fear, Madam, replyed he, that in this occaſion you take one vertue for another; and that this change, which hath appeared in your face, be not rather an effect of your great heart, then of your modeſty, ſeeing it may be you take it not well, that a Slave ſhould loſe the reſpect which he ows you, ſo far, as to dare to entertain you with his paſſion. You ſpeak ſo agreeably hereof, ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> interrupting him, that if my ſiſter will be perſwaded by me, ſhe ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be your Confident. I am not inconſiderate enough for that, anſwered the Marquis; and the thoughts of reſpect and adoration which I have for her, will not permit me to commit this fault.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sophronia,</hi> ſeeing that hereupon there was a great ſilence amongſt the company, which might trouble the Marquis, ſaid to him with a great deal of addreſs, that ſhe was glad to ſee a paſſion in him, which made her hope that at laſt he might be conſtant; ſince finding in a perſon whom he loved, all the beauties of the body, all the graces of the minde, and all the vertues of the ſoul, it was impoſsible for him to meet with any thing that was amiable in another, which was not in her. You have Reaſon, anſwered the Marquis, but not altogether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my natural inclination, though I love none, or to ſay better, adore none, but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon, yet have I found the means to mingle an inconſtancy with the love I bear her, whereof ſhe cannot be jealous. I have much ado to conceive this new myſtery, added my ſiſter; and I do not think, that ſhe, who is the cauſe of your love, will reign in a divided heart. My heart is wholly hers, replyed the Marquis, and to explain my thoughts unto you, know, that the perſon, whom I adore, is ſo marvelous, as it would be a crime in me, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60144:194"/> but one heart and one affection, to offer to love all that is amiable in her at one and the ſame time: ſo that to love her the more perfectly, and in ſome ſort alſo to follow this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which predominates over all mine, I give every day a new object to my paſsion. To day I adore her eyes; to morrow I love the beauty of her ſhape, the next day I ſuffer my ſelf to be charmed with the graces of her minde; another time her goodly aſpect raviſhes me; and by this means yielding my heart wholly to each of thoſe excellent qualities which ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes, I ſhall love her as much as ſhe deſerves to be; and without being inconſtant to her, I ſhall yet be always ſo much, as never to be weary of my ſervitude. This new way of loving ſo mightily ſurprized all the company, as albeit they had no great cauſe of joy, yet could they not forbear laughing at it. I ſhould never have done, if I ſhould rehearſe all the pleaſing paſſages, which the Marquis delivered in all the viſits which he gave to theſe two Princeſſes; it ſhall ſuffice then to tell you, that the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid</hi> had all the eſteem and all the affection for him, which a Princeſs, gallant enough, and who for all that was vertuous, was capable of.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time you are to know, that <hi>Aly</hi> had not failed in rendering an account to the King of the commiſſion which he had given him: but whereas he was a Lover and cunning, he had diſguiſed the truth of that which he had ſaid to <hi>Hipolita,</hi> and of that which <hi>Hipolita</hi> had anſwered him. For though my ſiſter had teſtified ſufficiently unto him, that <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s affection could never pleaſe her, yet he feared that if the King ſhould undertake to ſpeak to her himſelf, ſhe might at length be perſwaded; ſo that to keep him from it, he told him, that albeit <hi>Hipolita</hi> had not favorably received the declaration which he had made her of his love, yet he held it not abſolutely impoſſible to touch her heart; it having ſeemed unto him how he had obſerved, that the greateſt fear <hi>Hipolita</hi> had, was leſt the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> ſhould perceive this affection. Wherefore, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, it muſt be by me that ſhe muſt be acquainted with all the thoughts which you have for her, until ſuch time as by great hopes we have chaſed away this fear from her heart. For there is no doubt, added he, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the eſtate wherein I ſaw her minde, if you enterprize to ſpeak to her your ſelf, but you will be very ill ſatisfied of her, for the reaſon I have told you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdalla,</hi> though very amorous, and conſequently very impatient and very ſuſpicious, yet made do queſtion of <hi>Aly</hi>'s diſcourſe; and remitting himſelf abſolutely to his conduct, he conjured him to remember, that on the conqueſt of <hi>Hipolita</hi> all his felicity depended. In the mean while, albeit he had promiſed <hi>Aly</hi> to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve my ſiſter the leaſt teſtimony of his affection that he could, yet was it impoſſible for him to conceal his paſſion: for he no ſooner entred into <hi>Mariama</hi>'s lodging, but he asked for <hi>Hipolita;</hi> he no ſooner ſaw her, but a new joy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his face; <hi>Hipolita</hi>'s looks guided his whether he would or no; he followed her with his eyes whereſoever ſhe went; and ſeldom did he make a viſit without praiſing ſome beauty, or ſome vertue, which he ſaid he had not yet marked in her. Theſe praiſes did not pleaſe <hi>Aly</hi> at the beginning, nevertheleſs ſeeing he could not hinder them, whereas ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign prudence, or to ſay better, extream cunning, conſiſts in making all things ſerve for the deſign that one hath, he labored to draw ſome advantage from the love, which the King ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear to <hi>Hipolita.</hi> But before I acquaint you with it, I am to tell you, that after many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations which he had with her, wherein he always ſhewed, how much he eſteemed of her vertue, and approved of the refuſals ſhe had made of the Kings love; one day, when as he found her the moſt civilly diſpoſed for him (as he thought) and the moſt incenſed againſt the King, he undertook to diſcover unto her the paſſion he was in for her. And whereas ſhe was exceedingly ſurprized with ſuch a kinde of diſcourſe, and hath naturally an imperious ſpirit; Is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe unto him, that you can ſpeak to me in this ſort, and conſerve any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and judgment? Do you believe, added ſhe, that a perſon, which refuſes the affection of your King, can receive yours? Do you not remember, that you have an hundred times commended the reſolution which I have taken to dye, rather then to ſatisfie him? ſhall I be more vertuous, in harkening favorably to your love, then to <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s? What part do you play, ſaid ſhe unto him, without giving him time to interrupt her? You betray your Maſter in ſpeaking to me of your love; and if you will paſs for my Lover, you do me an injury in charging your ſelf with moving the Kings to me: and howſoever it be, I ought to hate and deſpiſe you more then him.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Hipolita</hi> had teſtified all her reſentment and her anger, <hi>Aly,</hi> nothing daunted, not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60144:195"/> diſpleaſed, beſought her not to condemn him without hearing. For, fair <hi>Hipolita,</hi> ſaid he unto her, it may be you will finde ſome difference between the love that <hi>Abdalla</hi> bears you, and that which I bear you: He onely loves the beauty of <hi>Hipolita,</hi> and I adore the vertue of <hi>Hipolita.</hi> He is not your ſervant, but to make you his Slave; and I do not love you, but to marry you. His flame is unjuſt, and mine is lawful; the end of his love is his own ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that of mine is your glory, and your conſervation. For <hi>in fine,</hi> continued he, if it be true that you love honor, you will have ſome indulgence for the affection which I carry to you; ſeeing there teſts no other mean to warrant you from the violences of <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s love, but that of receiving the ſame which I offer you. I acknowledg, ſaid he further to her, that I am an ill ſubject, but it is not but to be a faithful Lover, and becauſe I will not expoſe you to the greateſt miſeries, which a vertuous perſon can ſuffer. For, if you will, ſaid he unto her, all the Kings love, all his force, and all his power, ſhall not keep me, from protecting and marrying you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aly</hi> having made an end of ſpeaking, left <hi>Hipolita,</hi> for that he would not have her, ſaid he, anſwer him without adviſement, in a matter whereon all his happineſs or unhappineſs depended. From thence he went to the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> to whom in appearance he bore a great deal of reſpect. And whereas for ſome time paſt, this Princeſs had given him more commodity to ſpeak to her then before, out of the deſign ſhe had to diſcover his intentions concerning him that was to ſucceed <hi>Abdalla,</hi> it was not difficult for him to talk with her in private; ſo that after he had proteſted an inviolable fidelity to her, and had ſworn to her, that next to the glory and intereſts of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> nothing in the world was ſo dear to him as hers; he told her, that knowing her exceeding vertue and prudence, he thought he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to acquaint her, how the King was ſo deſperately in love with <hi>Hipolita,</hi> as he feared that his paſſion would carry him to loſe the reſpect which he owed to her, in drawing him to uſe ſome violence to this maid: That if in this occaſion he might be permitted to give adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements and counſel both together, he conceived that the beſt courſe could be taken, would be to remove <hi>Hipolita</hi> out of the way, or to marry her; That, as her Slave, ſhe might diſpoſe of her, without the Kings having any lawful pretext to contradict her, ſince he himſelf had beſtowed her on her.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs received this diſcourſe of <hi>Ala</hi>'s, as if ſhe were obliged to him for it; and although ſhe knew not as yet the intereſt which he had in this affair, becauſe ſhe had not ſeen <hi>Hipolita;</hi> yet ſhe believed that this generoſity, which appeared in his ſpeech, was not in his heart: She thanked him notwithſtanding for the advice he had given her; promiſed him to obſerve the Kings and <hi>Hipolita</hi>'s actions; and then told him, that ſhe would reſolve of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this affair, without demanding his counſel about it; and that he on his part ſhould not fail to advertiſe her of all that he knew. <hi>Aly,</hi> to let the Princeſs ſee that he lyed not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to call to minde all the teſtimonies of unquietneſs and affection, which the King could not conceal in the viſits he had rendred her for ſome time paſt. And when as ſhe had told him that ſhe remembred them very well, he went very well ſatisfied of her. For knowing the vertue and prudence of this Princeſs, he doubted not but that now underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love which the King bore to <hi>Hipolita,</hi> ſhe would oppoſe it with all her power; and ſo, if it happened that <hi>Hipolita</hi> ſhould tell her the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this thought, he had a long time already very much courted <hi>Aly,</hi> to the end he might gain him

For after he had well examined both the Kings love and his own, he found that what induſtry ſoever he could uſe, it would be impoſſible for him to marry <hi>Hipolita</hi> with <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s conſent; who ſhould no ſooner be incenſed againſt him, but the Princeſs <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> joyning her credit and addreſs to the juſt occaſion ſhe had to wiſh him ill, would no doubt conſtrain him to have recourſe to extream remedies.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch like thoughts it was that <hi>Aly</hi> had entertained himſelf a good while already, when as <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> who believed he was in love with <hi>Leonida,</hi> and conſequently hoped, that he would excuſe the paſſion he had for <hi>Sophronia,</hi> came unto him with an intent dextrouſly to learn of him what deſigns he had for that maid, to the end he might rule his by thoſe of a man, who, as he believed, durſt not condemn that in another, which he ſuffered in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>All their converſation at firſt was but of indifferent things, and of the beauty of <hi>Mariama</hi>'s Slaves. And whereas <hi>Aly</hi> was not ignorant of <hi>Abdelcader</hi>'s paſſion for <hi>Sophronia,</hi> he was willing in this occaſion to incenſe the mind of this Prince againſt <hi>Abdalla,</hi> and wholly to gain him to himſelf, to the end that if he were to make a univerſal ſubverſion in this State, <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cader</hi> might furniſh him with a pretext ſpecious enough, by giving the people to underſtand, that <hi>Abdalla</hi> by a teſtament, which always remained in <hi>Aly</hi>'s hands, intended his ſon ſhould raign to his prejudice: For howſoever, <hi>Abdelcader</hi> was <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s ſon, as well as <hi>Abdalla;</hi> and albeit he was no very able Prince, yet had he no vices, ſo that the people did not hate him. <hi>Aly</hi> conſidered further, that if he ſhould come to extream violence, and diſpoſſeſs <hi>Abdalla,</hi> that <hi>Abdelcader</hi> might raign, he ſhould make a King, without ceaſing to be one; it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he would have need of him for the Government of his <hi>State.</hi>

                     <hi>Aly,</hi> perceiving by the trouble which appeared in <hi>Abdelcader</hi>'s face, how much he was moved; and judging by his ſilence that he confided not in him, ſeeing he concealed his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid unto him to confirm him, that he had always done what he could to oppoſe ſuch violent maxims; that he remembred he was the ſon of his ancient Maſter; and that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him he would never omit any occaſion to ſerve him. But after many converſations on this ſubject, <hi>Aly</hi> ſeeing that the Kings love augmented dayly, and finding that his own al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways became ſtronger, propounded at length to <hi>Abdelcader</hi> the putting him in poſſeſſion, both of his Miſtreſs, and of the Crown of <hi>Marocco.</hi> So bold a propoſition made <hi>Abdelca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> doubt, that this was rather a diſcourſe to tempt him, and to diſcover his intentions, then to ſerve him. But <hi>Aly</hi> made him ſoon change his opinion; for having ſhewed him <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60144:196"/> teſtament, which he had in his keeping, whereby he left the Crown of <hi>Marocco</hi> to his ſon, to the prejudice of <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> he no longer doubted but that he might abſolutely confide in him; ſo that after this they thought of nothing but of executing their deſigns. <hi>Aly</hi> had for ſo long a time had the whole Government of this <hi>State,</hi> as there was not an Officer in all the Kingdom, that was not obliged to him for the Charge which he exerciſed: He was very powerful of himſelf; all the Kings Treaſures were in his hands; all ſtrong places depended on him; the memory of the <hi>Xerife Mahomet</hi> raigned ſtill amongſt theſe people; and the violent death of <hi>Hamet</hi> was the cauſe that <hi>Abdalla</hi> was not univerſally beloved: for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ople be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <hi>Aly</hi> had not put him to death but by his commandment, though it was not true.</p>
                  <p>Now to carry the matter with more certainty, <hi>Aly</hi> told <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> that the principal point was to render themſelves Maſters of <hi>Marocco:</hi> for by the experience of the paſt Wars, and by a fatality which ſeemed inevitable, all they who had ſeized on it had at the very ſame inſtant ſubjected all the reſt of the Kingdom; That to do it without danger he was to make ſhew, at ſuch time as <hi>Abdelcader</hi> ſhould enterprize the executing of the buſineſs, of being ſtill faithful to the King, to the end he might give him bad counſel, and ſeize upon his and <hi>Mariama</hi>'s perſon, when time ſhould ſerve for it, to put them in the ſame priſon, where <hi>Hamet, Muley Zidan,</hi> and his children had lyen. But that it was firſt requiſite to make it be dextrouſly bruted amongſt the people, that <hi>Abdalla</hi> would defraud him of the right he had to the Crown, and for that effect would not ſuffer him to marry; That to render the matter more plauſible, he ſhould in a publique audience go and demand permiſſion to marry a grand-child of the laſt King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who was in the Court of <hi>Marocco;</hi> but ſaid <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delcader</hi> then to him, If ſhe ſhould be granted unto me, I ſhould be extreamly perplext; for indeed I do not deſire the Crown of <hi>Marocco,</hi> but to ſhare it with the Slave <hi>Sophronia.</hi> Fear not that, ſaid he unto him, for I ſhall be of the Councel, and I will oblige <hi>Abdalla</hi> ſo ſeverely to refuſe her to you, as you ſhall then have a pretext ſpecious enough to make uſe of the Soldiers, which I ſhall give you to begin the revolt. And to let the people ſee <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s bad faith, and to oblige him not to doubt of me, until ſuch time as I am ſure of him, you muſt go to my Palace to offer ſome violence there, as it were charging me with the outrage you have received: And after you have made as though you had plunder'd it, you ſhall ſhew the people <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s teſtament, which I will give you before-hand. In the mean time be aſſured that I will take ſo good an order for all things, as you ſhall meet but with few ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to fight with; and that in a little time I will deliver you the key of the priſon, wherein I ſhall have ſhut up <hi>Abdalla,</hi> his ſon, and <hi>Mariama;</hi> and after this you ſhall have the Crown and <hi>Sophronia,</hi> whom you may marry if you think good; or according to our Laws treat as a Slave, ſince ſhe ſhall be yours: And for me, ſaid he unto him, <hi>Hipolita</hi> is the only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which I demand of you. You miſtake the name, ſaid <hi>Abdelcader</hi> to him, and you would no doubt ſpeak of <hi>Leonida.</hi> No, no, replyed <hi>Aly;</hi> and then he declared unto him the truth of the matter, and ſo they parted, after they had well examined their enterprize again, and fully reſolved not to let a day paſs, without laboring to advance the execution thereof as much as they could.</p>

The Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> on her part had imparted to <hi>Hipolita,</hi> and her companions, the converſation which ſhe had had with <hi>Aly;</hi> and <hi>Hipolita</hi> had alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Mariama</hi> with the declaration of love which he had made unto her, which poſſeſſed the Princeſs with a great deal of unquietneſs. I well foreſaw, ſaid ſhe unto them, that <hi>Aly</hi> was not diſ-intereſſed in this affair; but when as ſhe ſought for means to get out of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, ſhe could not imagine them. She knew that the King was ſo ſtrongly preoccupated with the opinion of <hi>Aly</hi>'s fidelity, that unleſs he learnt his crime from his own mouth, he would never believe it. She was indeed generous enough to venture any thing for the ſaving of theſe three maids, who craved protection of her with tears; but ſhe feared too, leſt if ſhe ſhould enterprize it, and it ſhould come to be diſcovered, ſhe might expoſe them to miſchiefs, which would be paſt remedy. She reſolved then firſt to obſerve <hi>Aly</hi> with care; to talk with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60144:196"/> him oftner then ſhe had uſed to do; and if ſhe found any likelyhood of being able to hurt him, to hazard all things for the executing of that ſecret hatred upon him which ſhe had ſo long a time concealed in her heart. And whereas ſhe had much addreſs, ſhe courted <hi>Abdalla</hi> more then ſhe was accuſtomed to do, that ſhe might ſtill gain further power over his mind for the deſtroying of that which <hi>Aly</hi> had gotten there. As for us, we lived in extream diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; for being advertiſed of all the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi>'s and her fair Slaves unquietneſs, and foreſeeing no end to ſo many miſeries, we led an idle and melancholick life, which was inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to us all, except the Marquiſs, who without regarding our misfortunes, eſteemed himſelf the happieſt man in the world, for being favorably looked upon by the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to prolong my diſcourſe with matters which are not neceſſary for you to know, I ſhall tell you, that in four or five converſations the Princeſſes addreſs was ſo great, that ſhe knew with as much certainty as ſtrong conjectures could give of it, that <hi>Aly</hi> had ill intentions for the Kings children. And without being able to divine that they were in ſome ſort to the advantage of <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> ſhe knew that if the King came to dye, he would not conſerve the Crown for his ſon. That which made <hi>Mariama</hi> more eaſily diſcover <hi>Aly</hi>'s deſigns was, that ſeeing the civility which ſhe had ſhewed to him ſome days before, and the vertue of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs being more dreaded of him then all <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s authority, he had uſed certain obſcure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes unto her, to make her apprehend, that if ſhe would embrace his friendſhip, he would cauſe the Crown of <hi>Marocco</hi> to fall upon the head of whomſoever ſhe would. For whereas ſhe was the widow of <hi>Muley Zidan,</hi> to whom of right the Kingdom appertained, if they had let him live, he thought that it may be ſhe was capable of the deſire to remount into the Throne of her Fathers. But that being no intention of hers, ſhe ſeemed not to underſtand any of <hi>Aly</hi>'s ſpeeches in that manner, though indeed ſhe marked them very exactly. After ſhe had throughly run over again in her mind, even to the leaſt circumſtances, whatſoever might either increaſe or diminiſh her ſuſpicions, ſhe reſolved to advertiſe the King thereof. But to prepare his mind for the entertaining of ſome diſtruſt of <hi>Aly</hi>'s fidelity, ſhe willed <hi>Hipolita</hi> to make <hi>Abdalla</hi> perceive, as often as ſhe ſaw him, that ſhe took great care to decline his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, to the end ſhe might be the more credited, when ſhe ſhould aſſure him that <hi>Aly</hi> had offered to marry her, for the ſecuring of her from his violences. The Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> who did nothing inconſiderately, reſolved for all that to tarry ſome time yet for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of her ſuſpicions.</p>
                  <p>In the mean ſeaſon <hi>Aly</hi> took order for all things neceſſary to his enterprize, and according to the plot which he and <hi>Abdelcader</hi> had layd, one morning when as the King of <hi>Marocco</hi> gave audience to all them which had any thing to requeſt of him, <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> followed by certain of his Partiſans, went and beſought the King to grant him the permiſſion to marry the grand-child of the laſt King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and to give him a portion anſwerable to a perſon of his condition; He told him that he was not ignorant how Princes, which might pretend to the Crown, were not their own, but the <hi>States,</hi> and for that reaſon he would not diſpoſe of himſelf without his leave: He added further, that the choyce which he had made could not be blamed, ſince it was a perſon of birth equal to his; and a perſon whom by reaſon of State he was to marry, or elſe they ſhould reſolve never to marry him: it being unlikely that they would beſtow her on a forraign Prince, which might make uſe of the right ſhe had to the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> for the troubling of that of <hi>Marocco.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdelcader</hi> by <hi>Aly</hi>'s counſel made this propoſition, rather as impoſing a Law, then craving a conſent; and whereas he feared nothing ſo much as the obtaining of that, which he ſeemed to deſire ſo earneſtly, when he found that <hi>Abdalla</hi> made no ſhew in his countenance of being any whit troubled with this propoſition, he, notwithſtanding his confidence in <hi>Aly</hi>'s promiſe to him to hinder it, added ſo many things more to thoſe he had already delivered, as <hi>Abdalla,</hi> after he had anſwered him, that the affair, whereof he ſpake, was of two great importance to be reſolved on precipitouſly, commanded him to hold his peace, and to withdraw.

                     </gap>ood of his <hi>State</hi> made him ſpeak, repreſented unto him, that in the deſign which he had to preſerve the Crown for his ſon, it imported much that <hi>Abdelcader</hi> ſhould not be married; and leſs yet to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Tunis,</hi> then to any other; becauſe in this ſort it was to give him right a ſecond time
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60144:197"/> to his Eſtates, and to furn'ſh him with a pretext to make War as often as he met with an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it; That to take from him the boldneſs thence-forward to offer ſuch like propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was to tell him abſolutely, that this marriage did not pleaſe him, even without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring the matter with any apparant reaſons, as he might do; becauſe, ſaid he, <hi>Abdelcader</hi>'s boldneſs could not be ſufficiently puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdalla</hi> following <hi>Aly</hi>'s opinion in all things, contradicted him not in this, where he thought his intereſt alone was regarded. He ſent <hi>Abdelcader</hi> word then, that he forbad him to think of marrying himſelf, either to the Princeſs of <hi>Tunis,</hi> or to any other; that he ſhould leave to him the care of chuſing a wife for him; and that if he did otherwiſe, he ſhould then be declared guilty of High Treaſon. <hi>Abdelcader</hi> no ſooner received this anſwer, but every one in <hi>Marocco</hi> knew it, and every one murmured at it. The Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> could not comprehend this buſineſs; for ſhe knew that <hi>Abdelcader</hi> had teſtified a great deal of love to <hi>Sophronia</hi> in divers occaſions; and knew alſo that he had never regarded the Princeſs of <hi>Tunis</hi> but with indifferency; and that if there had not been ſome hidden thing in his deſign, ſhe ſhould have been the firſt to whom he would have ſpoken of it: but howſoever ſhe reaſoned thereupon, ſhe could not diſcover the truth. And whereas <hi>Hipolita</hi> had for ſome time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lived with the King, as ſhe had ordained her, ſhe obſerved that <hi>Abdalla</hi> perceived this change; ſo that ſeeing the matter in this eſtate, ſhe went one morning to his lodging, where ſhe craved the favor of him to talk with him in private, and the King having granted it to her, ſhe beſought him to promiſe her, that if he did not give credit to what ſhe was going to tell him, he at leaſtwiſe would never ſpeak of it again; being fully reſolved not to acquaint him with that ſhe had to communicate unto him, unleſs he would engage his word unto her to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>The King, being touched with an extraordinary curioſity, and yet fearing that <hi>Mariama</hi> would ſpeak to him of his love to <hi>Hipolita,</hi> ſtood a while without anſwering her; but at length having promiſed her as much as ſhe had deſired of him, ſhe began to prepare his mind with a very particular addreſs. I know, ſaid ſhe unto him, that for this which I am going to tell you I ought to be ſuſpected of you, either of malice, or of preoccupation: I know alſo, that <hi>Aly</hi> being ſo mightily eſtabliſhed in your affection, I ſhall expoſe my ſelf to the hazard of diſpleaſing you, in telling you that I ſuſpect he is not ſo faithful unto you, as his birth and obligations to you ought to make him: I know too, that in what manner ſoever you hear the buſineſs, it will be ſtill offenſive unto you; for if you beleeve there is any malice in my diſcourſe, you will no doubt be ſorry to find a ſtain in the Soul of a perſon that is ſo dear unto you; and if on the contrary you find that I am not to blame, the diſpleaſure of having been betrayed by a man whom you have ſo much obliged will diſquiet you; and whether it be out of a ſenſe of glory, or of tenderneſs, you will be grieved: Judg then, my Lord, if the matter which I am to tell you be not important, ſince bearing you all the reſpect and all the affection that I ought to have for a Prince, who is both my King and my brother, I expoſe my ſelf not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to the hazard of troubling his reſt, and getting his hatred, which is to me my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt misfortune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdalla,</hi> amazed with <hi>Mariama</hi>'s diſcourſe, though he did not believe that ſhe could tell him any thing which was true againſt <hi>Aly</hi>'s fidelity, yet left he not to aſſure her, that in caſe the ſuſpicions which ſhe ſaid ſhe had againſt <hi>Aly</hi> proved not to be well grounded, he would judg well of her intentions, and be always obliged unto her for her zeal and affection. After this <hi>Mariama,</hi> to ſtir up ſome trouble in <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s mind, and touch his heart where it was moſt ſenſible, imparted unto him how <hi>Aly,</hi> forgetting the reſpect which he owed to him, had been ſo daring as to profeſs love to the Slave <hi>Hipolita,</hi> who belonged to her; but this prudent Prince did not let <hi>Abdalla</hi> know, that ſhe underſtood any thing of his affection; ſo that without ſtanding longer on this diſcourſe, yet this is not that, ſaid ſhe unto him, which obliges me to ſpeak to you of <hi>Aly,</hi> but the deſign which he hath, if you chance to dye before him, to break the teſtament you have made him, by taking the Crown from off the head of your ſon, to diſpoſe of it according to his pleaſure, or it may be to ſet it on his own head.</p>
                  <p>So ſtrange an accuſation did not at firſt encounter with any great belief in <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s mind, thinking that the ſecret hate, which this Princeſs bore <hi>Aly,</hi> made her judg of him in this ſort for that which regarded his <hi>State;</hi> but for that which concerned his love, though it was
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60144:197"/> more unlikely then the other, becauſe he might conceive, that <hi>Mariama</hi> had taken his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident for a Lover of <hi>Hipolita,</hi> yet he beleeved more of it then ſhe would have had him. And making ſhew of being more moved with <hi>Aly</hi>'s want of reſpect to her, then with his own intereſt, he demanded of her very exactly, how ſhe came to perceive <hi>Aly</hi>'s paſſion; and whether the conjectures ſhe had of it were ſtrong enough? becauſe if it proved to be ſo, he meant to puniſh him for his boldneſs. My Lord, ſaid this Princeſs unto him, you do me too much favor, rather to think of me, then of the good of your <hi>State;</hi> but to imitate your generoſity, be pleaſed, without conſidering me, to let me regard nothing but your perſon alone, and by ſome invention let me furniſh you with means, either to convince or juſtifie <hi>Aly.</hi> And then, without <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s demanding it, ſhe recounted all thoſe things unto him which had been cauſe of her ſuſpicions: but at length the trouble of this Princes mind being ſomewhat appeaſed, he beleeved that <hi>Aly</hi> might be his Rival, but beleeved not that he had any deſign upon his Crown. Howbeit <hi>Mariama</hi> ſaid ſo much unto him, that in the end with her entreaties and reaſons ſhe obtained of him, that for fifteen days ſpace he would do whatſoever ſhe would have him for the clearing of the buſineſs. This Prince had much ado to reſolve upon making any doubt of <hi>Aly</hi>'s fidelity, ſo far forth as to ſeek out the means of convincing him; but at laſt the conſideration of <hi>Mariama,</hi> and a little touch of jealouſie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him unto it: yet was it upon condition, that if <hi>Aly</hi> were found innocent, ſhe ſhould from thence-forward have as much goodneſs for him, as ſhe had had averſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mariama</hi> having promiſed <hi>Abdalla</hi> all that he deſired, ſhe began the very ſame day one of the moſt extraordinary Artifices, as ever was made uſe of, for the diſcovery of the thoughts of an ambitious man and a Traytor; and lo, how ſhe proceeded. She obliged <hi>Abdalla</hi> to keep his chamber certain days, and not to let himſelf be ſeen of any but his Phyſicians, and the Slaves which ſerved him. At firſt <hi>Aly</hi> marvelled not to ſee the door kept faſt againſt all the Great ones of the Kingdom, becauſe he knew that it is the cuſtom of the Kings of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> to ſhut themſelves up many times whole Moneths together with their wives and Slaves, to the end that ſuffering not themſelves to be ſeen ſo often, the people may reſpect them the more: neither did he find it ſtrange, that he himſelf was not permitted to enter there, by reaſon <hi>Mariama,</hi> who kept her deſign concealed, told him, that <hi>Abdalla</hi> was not well, and that they which looked to him, had forbidden any body from ſeeing him; as indeed the Phyſicians had a command f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om the King to ſay ſo, and to be always very frequent about him, that it might be beleeved he was ſic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. During this, <hi>Aly</hi> was ſomewhat jealous and fearful, that this retirement proceeded rather from <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s love, then from any malady; but at length the knowledg he had of <hi>Mariama</hi>'s vertue diſſipated this ſuſpicion, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, as all others did, that the King was effectively ſick. In the mean time, <hi>Abdelcader</hi> and he thought of the deſign they had in hand; and they brought the buſineſs to ſuch a paſs, as it wanted not above eight days of being in an eſtate to be ready to break forth, when as <hi>Mariama</hi> began to tell <hi>Aly,</hi> that the King was in danger; that his diſeaſe became every day worſe and worſe; and that if he mended not the ſooner, his Phyſicians were out of hope of him.</p>
                  <p>This Princeſs had carried the matter with ſuch Art, as all thoſe of the Palace were in tears; for ſhe had ſo well inſtructed all the perſons that ſaw the Prince, as with a feigned melancholy they poſſeſſed every one that ſpake to them with a true one. This falſe news ſtayed <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cader</hi>'s deſigns; for <hi>Aly</hi> repreſented unto him, that if the King ſhould happen to dye, it would be a more favorable conjuncture for them, then that wherein they were, to make the buſineſs which they had projected, ſucceed; becauſe then they ſhould have a lawful cauſe to take up Arms for the executing of the <hi>Xeriffe Mahomet</hi>'s Teſtament, to the prejudice of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla's:</hi> That in the mean ſeaſon they were not to neglect giving order for all things; and to cauſe as many Soldiers, as they could, of all the Gariſons which depended the moſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Aly,</hi> to come ſecretly into <hi>Marocco,</hi> to the end they might make uſe of them, as ſoon as <hi>Abdalla</hi> ſhould be dead, or eſcaped from the danger wherein they thought him to be. <hi>Aly</hi> in this incertainty went twenty times a day to <hi>Mariama</hi>'s lodging to know how the King did; but though he was one of the moſt dextrous men in the world, yet was this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs more then he. In the beginning of this fiction ſhe ſighed, and ſhewed as much affliction, as if that which ſhe ſaid had been true; but when it came near to the time, wherein ſhe had reſolved to finiſh her deſign, as often as <hi>Aly</hi> ſaw her ſhe compoſed her countenance in that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60144:198"/> manner, as it ſeemed ſhe took great care to conceal a part of her grief; and that her Soul was more nearly touched, then ſhe made ſhew of. This Artifice failed not to work that which ſhe expected from it; for <hi>Aly,</hi> thinking he had obſerved, how this Princeſs affected to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more conſtant, then ſhe was, beleeved that <hi>Abdalla</hi> was dead; and that <hi>Mariama,</hi> for ſome ſecret deſign, or to ſeize upon the Crown, or to conſerve it for <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s ſon, would not publiſh it as yet.</p>
                  <p>When as <hi>Mariama</hi> perceived <hi>Aly</hi>'s thought, ſhe advertiſed <hi>Abdalla,</hi> that the next day ſhe would either convince, or juſtifie his favorite: And having inſtructed him in that which ſhe would have him to do, ſhe cauſed a Guard to come in for to ſeize on <hi>Aly,</hi> in caſe there ſhould be need of it; and took order for all things ſo ſecretly, as no body diſcovered any thing. The day following <hi>Aly</hi> early in the morning came to <hi>Mariama,</hi> with an intent to employ all his addreſs for the clearing of the doubt wherein he was: for ambition and love gave him ſo much impatience, as he had no reſt. And verily in this occaſion the protection of Heaven appeared viſibly, both to revenge <hi>Mariama</hi> of <hi>Aly</hi>'s cruelty, and to preſerve us. For it is certain, that as the matter was carried, <hi>Abdalla</hi> and <hi>Mariama</hi> had been loſt; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia</hi> had been expoſed to the violences of <hi>Abdelcader; Hipolita</hi> to the brutiſhneſs of <hi>Aly,</hi> and the reſt of us to be conſtrained to dye in defending them, or not to ſurvive their loſs, had not <hi>Mariama</hi> wrought as ſhe did.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>in fine, Aly,</hi> being come one morning, as I have told you, to the Princeſſes chamber, and ſhe having uſed as much addreſs in talking with him, as ſhe had done at other times, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in ſuch ſort the opinion which he had that <hi>Abdalla</hi> was dead, as not able to let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be any longer guided by prudence, he in plain terms deſired the Princeſs to tell him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King were not dead? becauſe, ſaid he, if it be ſo, it were fit that the affairs of the Kingdom were ſpeedily provided for. <hi>Mariama,</hi> ſeeing ſo fair a beginning to her deſign, did not anſwer him but with a great ſigh, and without ſaying any thing unto him, ſhe led him into <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s chamber. Now albeit he was already perſwaded that the King was dead, yet left he not to be mightily ſurprized to ſee all this chamber hung with black Velvet, all the windows ſhut, in the midſt a great bed of State invironed with a baluſtrate of Ebony, ſet all about with flaming Torches, and upon Cuſhions near to the Bed, the Mantle Royal, the Scepter, the Crown, and the Turbant of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> with his Scymitar at the feet of the Bed, whereupon was a large black Cloth trailing a great way on the ground, which ſeemed to cover the body of the King; ſome of his Wives and Slaves were about the Baluſtrade, who teſtified by their countenance ſo ſenſible a ſorrow, as would have drawn tears from any other but <hi>Aly.</hi> The Princeſs having conducted him then into this chamber of mourning, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that this ſad object had ſufficiently perſwaded him that which ſhe deſired he ſhould beleeve, ſhe began to ſhew an extream affliction, and to requeſt him with feigned tears, that he would perform the Kings laſt Will, in conſerving the Crown for his ſon, according to the Teſtament he had made, whereof he had the cuſtody, though it was contrary to the <hi>Xeriffe Mahomet</hi>'s intention. And then, ſaid ſhe unto him, he hath commanded me to reſtore the Slave <hi>Hipolita,</hi> and her fellows, to their liberty; in regard it had ſeemed unto him that he had violated the Law of Nations in retaining perſons in ſlavery, who by Tempeſt had been driven into <hi>Marocco.</hi> But, continued ſhe, generous <hi>Aly,</hi> this laſt thing imports not much; nor have I told it you, but that I would not fail in any thing which my King, my brother, and my Lord, hath given me in charge at his death. For ſo much as regards the Prince his ſon, perform what you have promiſed him, and what you ought to do.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Abdalla,</hi> anſwered <hi>Aly</hi> inſolently, would have me conſerve the Crown for his ſon, he ſhould have lived a longer time; for it ſhall never be reproached unto me, that I have placed an Infant on the Throne of <hi>Marocco.</hi> The ſame Teſtament, added he, which gave the Crown to <hi>Abdalla,</hi> ſhall ſet it on the head of ſome other; for in concluſiion, it is for men to govern children, and not for children to govern men, no more then for women to give Councels of <hi>State.</hi> And, continued he, for the Slave <hi>Hipolita,</hi> he that ſhall be King ſhall diſpoſe of her; and until then, whereas the Charge which I hold gives me abſolute power over the <hi>State,</hi> whenſoever an interraign happens, remit her preſently into my hands, to the end that ceaſing to be a Slave, I may at leaſtwiſe perform <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s will, in breaking off her chains.</p>
                  <p>Ah, vile Traytor! cryed <hi>Abdalla,</hi> in coming out from under that Cloth of black Velvet,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60144:198"/> under which he was hidden; thy perſideouſneſs muſt be puniſhed with my hand; ſaying ſo, <hi>Abdalla</hi> layd hold on his Scymitar, and all the Guard, which lay concealed for that effect, ruſhing into the chamber, <hi>Aly</hi> was ſo ſurprized, and ſo confounded, as he knew not at firſt whether it were an apparition, or whether eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In ſo great a trouble <hi>Abdalla</hi> without doubt had killed him, if the Princeſs <hi>Mariama,</hi> who would not have him dye by ſo illuſtrious an hand, had not hindred him; which was the cauſe, that <hi>Aly,</hi> being come to himſelf again, and freeing himſelf from the Guard which would have ſeized upon him, opened a window when as they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it, and whereas all the houſes of that Country, as they are here, are exceeding low, he leaped into the Court-yard, and was ſo fortunate as he did not hurt himſelf, but got ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r away out of the Palace; leaving <hi>Abdalla</hi> ſo amazed and afflicted at his perfidiouſneſs, and <hi>Mariama</hi> ſo ſatified with the happy ſucceſs of her deſign, that if the diſpleaſure of ſeeing <hi>Aly</hi> eſcaped had not moderated her joy, it would have been too violent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdalla</hi> inſtantly commanded him to be purſued with all ſpeed, and alive or dead to be brought unto him: But <hi>Aly</hi> was already gotten into a mans houſe, whoſe life before times he had ſaved. For in what diſorder ſoever his ſoul was, yet had he judgment enough not to go to his own home; imagining rightly that he would be ſought for there. In the mean time, the fear he had leſt the King ſhould cauſe the gates of the City to be ſhut, made him ſeek out all kinde of inventions to eſcape. For albeit the plot which he had layd with <hi>Abdelcader</hi> was ready to be executed, yet wanted it ſo much time, as he durſt not enterprize it, eſpecially out of the thought he had, that they would not have made uſe of ſo extraordinary an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſcover his intentions, without having taken order for all things. He ſent word then ſecretly to <hi>Abdelcader,</hi> that he ſhould attempt nothing until he was in one of the places of their intelligence, to the end they might be aſſured of a retreat, if their affairs ſhould go ill. After that, he diſguiſed himſelf like a woman; for whereas they are all vailed in that Country, he believed that getting ſpeedily out of the City, before any exact order was given at the gates, it would be eaſie for him to ſave himſelf, as indeed it fell out. He that ſerved him in this occaſion promiſed to bring him an horſe to a place, which was not above a mile from the Town; and then <hi>Aly,</hi> being diſguiſed in the manner that I have related, went out of <hi>Marocco</hi> a very little before the Guards had been placed at the Gates, with a Command to ſuffer no body to paſs out upon any pretext whatſoever. In the mean ſpace <hi>Abdalla</hi> had ſent to ſearch for <hi>Aly</hi> in his Palace, and afterward cauſed it to be proclaimed over all the City, that whoſoever could bring <hi>Aly</hi> unto him ſhould have a recompence able to enrich him for all his life.</p>
                  <p>The people, no ſooner underſtood that <hi>Aly</hi> was in diſgrace, but falling into an uproar, and manifeſting their ſecret hatred unto him, plundered his Palace; and this wretched man had not a friend, who for his own ſecurity did not at leaſt-wiſe ſeem to be otherwiſe. But whereas the people are inconſtant in their reſolutions, after they had committed an hundred outrages, there ran a bruit amongſt this multitude, that <hi>Abdalla</hi> was dead; and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation which had been made was an artifice of <hi>Aly,</hi> who meant to diſcover by this ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether he were beloved, or hated. And whereas all extraordinary novelties eaſily finde credit with the people, they believed this ſame; and carryed by deſpair for that they had uſed too much precipitation, they went to the Court in Arms for to ſee <hi>Abdalla;</hi> who, not knowing whether theſe which uſed this violence were <hi>Aly</hi>'s partakers or no, durſt not go forth to ſhew himſelf to them; not having ſcarce any body with him, becauſe he had ſent all them of his ordinary Guard in ſearch of <hi>Aly.</hi> The people in the mean while not ſeeing <hi>Abdalla</hi> appear, were confirmed in their opinion, and augmenting their deſpair and fury they attempted to force the Palace; and they had already broken up the firſt gate, when as <hi>Abdalla,</hi> cauſing himſelf to be armed, and we being placed about him, appeaſed this ſtorm with his preſence, and by his ſpeech aſſured the people that <hi>Aly</hi> had incurred his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the man, who had promiſed to bring him an horſe, found himſelf to be very much perplexed for the keeping of his word with him; for when as he preſented himſelf to get forth, upon pretext of ſome buſineſs that he had in the Country, the Guards were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet, and having been at all the gates in vain, yet would he not give over ſo, but thought that another might be more fortunate then he; wherefore he confided in one of <hi>Aly</hi>'s friends,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60144:199"/> who taking the ſame horſe which the other had made uſe of before, he went to one of the gates to get forth, but he had the like ſucceſs as the former; who, willing to hazard all for <hi>Aly,</hi> ſent a third perſon thither: which was the cauſe, that one of the Guard, who had more brain then the reſt, perceived, that although three ſeveral men had preſented themſelves for to go out of the City, yet it had been ſtill with one and the ſame horſe; ſo that he certainly b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Captain then, having given order to the two Soldiers to ſeize on this man, went to the place where he had ſeen the woman hide her ſelf, and had not gone fifty paces but he found her at the foot of a tree; where, keeping down her vail ſtill about her, ſhe beſought him, in counterfeiting her voyce, not to do her any violence. And when ſhe ſaw that this man had no intent to uſe her civilly, and ſeemed fully reſolved to diſcover what ſhe was, ſhe would have tempted this Captain with the hope of a great recompence; ſo that ſuddenly lifting up her vail, <hi>Thou ſeeſt,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the infortunate</hi> Aly, <hi>who can make thee happy if thou beeſt wiſe; for if thou wilt reſolve to let me eſcape, I will put thee in a condition that thou ſhalt never need to ask any thing more of Fortune.</hi> This Captain, who was faithful, or it may be did not believe that <hi>Aly</hi> in the caſe he was in could recompence him as much as he ſaid, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that he would never enrich himſelf by a Treaſon, and without further delay he called his companions, who, having tyed the man, on whom they had ſeized, to a tree, went to help him to take the miſerable <hi>Aly,</hi> who, though without Arms, left not off reſiſting them for while. But at laſt they brought him to <hi>Marocco,</hi> and having conducted him before <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla,</hi> this Prince reviled him with all imaginable reproaches, And whereas <hi>Aly</hi> had always been happy, this one blow of unhappineſs ſo mightily ſurprized him, as that judgment and prudence, which had rendred him ſo conſiderable in his proſperity, wholly abandoned him in his misfortune: ſo that in ſtead of ſeeking to colour his fault, he confeſſed it as it was, and related unto <hi>Abdalla</hi> all that he had ſaid and thought, juſt in the ſame manner as I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it unto you, for the Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

At laſt, love, anger, intereſt of <hi>State,</hi> and jealouſie, made the King without further delay, as ſoon as <hi>Abdelcader</hi> was app ehended, even the very ſame day take off the ambitious <hi>Aly</hi>'s head, who ſeeing his loſs inevitable reſolved for it with conſtancy enough. Thus was the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> revenged on this man for his cruelty, and <hi>Hipolita</hi> delivered from one of her perſecutors. <hi>Aly</hi> was no ſooner dead, but the Princeſs <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> always generous, went and caſt her ſelf at the Kings feet, to beg <hi>Abdelcader</hi>'s life of him, which he granted to her tears, upon condition that he ſhould remain for ſome time a priſoner: For alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60144:199"/>
                  <p>But, Madam, to make an end of telling you at once, both the goodneſs of <hi>Mariama,</hi> and our fortune, you ſhall underſtand, that in the confuſion wherein all the City of <hi>Marocco</hi> was this day, when as the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> entred into a Chamber where theſe three fair Slaves were, and ſaw them all in tears, eſpecially <hi>Hipolita,</hi> who knew well that ſhe was in part cauſe of all this diſorder: this Princeſs, I ſay, ſeeing them in this eſtate, had ſo much gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, though ſhe loved them very tenderly, as to deprive her ſelf for ever of them: It may be alſo, that the deſign of taking from the King an object of paſſion, which might trouble his reſt; from <hi>Abdelcader</hi> that which had made him fail in this duty; and from the Princeſs <hi>Lela Mahabid</hi> another, which might make her in ſome ſort forget the rank which ſhe held, carryed her to this reſolution. But in concluſion, a little intereſt, and a great deal of genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, made her tell them, that profit was to be made of others misfortune: ſo that before the King had leaſure to ask for them, ſhe cauſed them to be ſecretly conveyed to the houſe of a man, who abſolutely depended on her; and having advertiſed us to repair thither, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued concealed there above eight days. She in like ſort cauſed the Mariners and Soldiers, which we had brought to <hi>Marocco,</hi> to be delivered; for the ambitious <hi>Aly</hi> being dead, the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> was as powerful in the <hi>State</hi> as the King himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The day following, <hi>Abdalla,</hi> ſeeing the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> with a feigned melancholy in her face, which yet he believed to be true, demanded of her, whether revenge, which is ſaid to be one of the greateſt pleaſures of Kings, did not give her ſome? My Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, preſent misfortunes are doubtleſs more ſenſible then paſt pleaſures; the loſs of the Slaves which you gave me, is cauſe of more grief to me, then that of <hi>Aly</hi> hath made me feel joy. So ſtrange a diſcourſe ſurprized the King extreamly; and whereas he deſired to be cleared therein, the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> told him, that in the confuſion wherein all things were the day before, whether <hi>Aly</hi> had cauſed them to be carryed away by force, or whether we had contributed any thing thereunto, ſo it was, that returning in the Evening to her lodging, ſhe had not found them there, neither could ſhe poſſibly learn any news of them. I will not repeat unto you all that <hi>Abdalla</hi> ſaid in this occaſion, although the Princeſs <hi>Mariama</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us with it: But in concluſion, it ſuffices you ſhould know, that <hi>Abdalla</hi> took this adventure as an amorous Prince would do; and after he had cauſed ſearch to be made over all the City, except in the place where we were, which by the care of the Princeſs was exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe had the goodneſs to come ſecretly and bid her dear Slaves farewell, to whom alſo ſhe gave very rich gifts: And the night following, having diſpoſed of all things for our departure, ſhe cauſed us to be imbarqued in a Merchants Veſſel, that ſet ſail the ſame night; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Captain, who was of <hi>Palermo,</hi> undertook to carry us whitherſoever we would go, in conſideration of an exceſſive ſum of money which ſhe gave him for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, Madam, before I leave <hi>Marocco,</hi> I am to tell you, that the Marquis was not ſo glad of the liberty which we hoped to enjoy, as for that he ſhould no longer be expoſed to the hazard of being conſtant. I ſhould have dyed, ſaid he unto us, had I not eſcaped from ſo great a danger; for if I had tarryed longer at <hi>Marocco,</hi> I was in jeopardy of changing my humor, in not changing my Miſtreſs: But in the end, Madam, we had no great leaſure to laugh at the Marquis his agreeable humor, for we had not made two days ſail, when as we encountred a Veſſel, by the <hi>Turks</hi> called a Carmoſſal, which having ſet upon ours, that was but ill provided of things neceſſary for war, became Maſter of it, notwithſtanding any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance we could make; and the <hi>Turks,</hi> which commanded this Veſſel, took us, and brought us to be ſold here at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where our deſtiny hath been ſuch as you have underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſabella</hi> thanked <hi>Doria</hi> for the pains he had taken in recounting this Hiſtory unto her. As for me, ſaid <hi>Hipolita,</hi> I am not contented with my Brother, for me-thinks he ſtood a little too much in examining that which he calls fantaſticalneſs in my humor. It is not for that you complain, anſwered <hi>Horatio</hi> ſmiling, but rather becauſe you apprehend, that we do not judg of the greatneſs of your affection but by that of your jealouſie. For my part, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, I do not complain of <hi>Doria;</hi> and I have taken more delight in hearing him relate my love, then I took in it when I was in <hi>Marocco.</hi> And for ſo much as regards me, added <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> I am the leaſt ſatisfied with his relation, ſeeing I ſerved but for a pretext to <hi>Aly</hi>'s love.

But whereas the fear of diſpleaſing <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſo much the greater, as his love was the ſtronger, he could not reſolve, not only to forbid her from going forth, but to ſee her that day wherein ſhe ſhould receive this order; neither knew he what perſon to chuſe that might deliver this rude meſſage unto her: At laſt upon good adviſement he ſent for the <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> whom he enjoyned, after he had extreamly careſſed her, ſo to order the matter, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> might go but very ſeldom out of the <hi>Serraglio.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, ſaid <hi>Aſteria</hi> unto him, hath thy Highneſs forgot what thou ſaidſt to her yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day with thine own mouth? No, ſaid the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> unto her, and therefore it is why I will not make a prohibition which contravenes the civilities I have uſed to her, but I would willingly, that by thy counſel and addreſs, without any ſhew of my conſtraining her, ſhe ſhould be carried of her ſelf to do that which I deſire; for the <hi>Sultana</hi> Queen complains of the liberty which I give her, the people murmur at it, all the <hi>Sultanaes</hi> take it ill, and hate her for it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, anſwered <hi>Aſteria,</hi> after that which thy Highneſs hath ſaid to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I doubt that my counſel and ſpeeches will be ſuſpected of her; and that ſhe will give more credit to thy words, then to all that I can ſay to her. I perceive well, ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> then to her, that thou loveſt not to carry diſpleaſing news; but howſoever it concerns thee to pleaſe and obey me. I do not refuſe either the one or the other, replyed the <hi>Sultana</hi> with a great deal of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but if I might be permitted to ſay what I think, I would beſeech thy Highneſs to conſider if there be not a kind of rigor in keeping <hi>Iſabella</hi> from viſiting the only perſons which are dear to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In truth, my Lord, continued ſhe, the vertue of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and the ſervices of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſhould deſerve methinks, that our Cuſtoms ſhould not be ſo much conſidered as their Intereſts. <hi>Soliman,</hi> not being able to anſwer the <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> grew angry with her; you have your Reaſons, ſaid he unto her, and I have mine; but if I had none, I would not for all that but be obeyed: Go then, and do what I command you, for otherwiſe you alone ſhall be reſponſable to me for <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s actions. <hi>Asteria</hi> ſeeing ſo much anger in <hi>Soliman</hi>'s eyes, no longer doubted but that this paſſion was occaſioned by another, ſo that fearing to hurt <hi>Iſabella</hi> in thinking to ſerve her, ſhe beſought the <hi>Sultan</hi> to pardon her, and went away, after ſhe had promiſed him to perform his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultana Asteria,</hi> being extreamly afflicted for the commiſſion ſhe had received, went to <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s lodging, who ſeeing her enter with an extraordinary melancholy; Is it in your perſon, or in mine, ſaid ſhe unto her, that I am unhappy? I could wiſh, anſwered <hi>Asteria</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60144:201"/> imbracing her, that you were in a condition of having no other grief, but that of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion which others miſeries might give you, but Fortune will not treat you ſo favorably. <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſuddenly bluſhed, and according to the cuſtom of thoſe that love well, ſhe preſently thought of that which was moſt dear to her, and imagined that ſome misfortune was befallen the <hi>grand Viſier;</hi> ſo that beholding <hi>Aſteria</hi> with an extraordinary attention, Is there, ſaid ſhe unto her, any unlucky accident hapned unto <hi>Ibrahim?</hi> hath he been beaten? is he dead, or a priſoner? No, anſwered <hi>Asteria,</hi> there is not any of that arrived; and that which I am to tell you, is indeed enough to make you murmur, but not enough to poſſeſs you with any extream grief; and if you diſcern any melancholy in my face, it is rather a mark of the part which I take in all that concerns you, then of the greatneſs of your misfortune. And then <hi>Aſteria,</hi> not to hold her longer in pain, recounted unto her all the converſation which ſhe had had with <hi>Soliman,</hi> and thereupon adviſed her to comply ſo far with him. For truly, ſaid ſhe unto her, either the <hi>Sultan</hi> does love you, or he does not; if he does not, and that he deſires you ſhould abide here, to ſatisfie <hi>Roxelana,</hi> and the cuſtom, you are not to oppoſe his pleaſure: and contrarily, if it be true, that he is in paſſion for you, the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A Lover in choller (as I conceive) is more to be feared then another; for whereas choller doth moſt commonly baniſh away reſpect from the Souls of thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth, one muſt forbear as long as is poſſible from expoſing ones ſelf to the hazard of angering an amorous Prince, who being able to do whatſoever he will, is always in an eſtate to be feared. You have reaſon, generous <hi>Aſteria,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> unto her, but what will my friends ſay, when they ſhall ſee that I do not viſit them any more, and that I abandon them? Will they not have cauſe to think, that the magnificences of the <hi>Serraglio</hi> have blinded me? and it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet worſe. No, no, ſaid <hi>Aſteria,</hi> for we will cauſe them to be advertiſed of the truth of the matter, or at leaſtwiſe of the pretext which they have made uſe of to retain you here. But, added <hi>Iſabella,</hi> what end can I foreſee of my miſery? The return of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> replyed <hi>Aſteria,</hi> will make it ceaſe; and he ſhall no ſooner be at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but the <hi>Sultan</hi> will no longer have other then juſt deſires, and you ſhall recover your liberty. After that theſe two vertuous perſons had entertained themſelves a while, they parted; <hi>Aſteria</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing <hi>Iſabella,</hi> if ſhe would write to her Friends, to ſee her Letter conveyed unto them the next morning, as indeed ſhe failed not to do.</p>
               <p>This news ſtrangely ſurprized all this fair Troop; but whereas the pretext, whereof <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> made uſe, was not without probability, and that <hi>Iſabella</hi> by her Letter had rendred it more likely unto them, to the end ſhe might keep them from conceiving any thing to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, they believed it to be as it was repreſented unto them, without ſeeking for any other explication thereof; comforting themſelves in ſome ſort with the hope which <hi>Iſabella</hi> gave them of viſiting them ſometimes: For to make their ſeparation the eaſier, though ſhe could not hear from <hi>Ibrahim</hi> as yet, ſhe left not for all that to aſſure them that he would be back in a little ſpace; and ſo conſequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntly they ſhould ere long be in an eſtate of going to ſee their Country again.</p>
               <p>This hope failed not to work the effect which <hi>Iſabella</hi> expected from it; all this company was more jovial and more ſociable, and whereas <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Palace was wonderful fair, and that they were ſerved thereby the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s order exceeding magnificently, their exile no doubt was ſupportable enough; ſometimes they walked in the Garden; ſometimes they romed up and down in the Grot, or ſat in the ſhade of the Grove of Orange Trees, which was hard by; other whiles they beſtowed their time in the Gallery of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperors; and many times alſo in the Library, where they met with that which diverted their ſorrow, or contented their curioſity. But one day when as they met all together in <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Cabinet, after they had called to mind all their miſhaps, and had admired by what adventure Fortune had conducted them into a place, where they had encountred <hi>Iſabella,</hi> paſſing inſenſibly from one diſcourſe to another, they bethought them that they had not been yet acquainted with that which had arrived to the Marquiſs. Whereupon <hi>Leonida</hi> demanded of him why he had not related it unto them? You have ſhewed your ſelves ſo little curious of it, replyed he, that I am reſolved not to give you this ſatisfaction without ſome recompence. You have too noble a Soul, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> to him ſmiling, to be mercenary; and then again, what can you ask of exiled perſons, and ſuch too as do not enjoy their liberty? To put you yet into
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60144:201"/> more pain, replyed the Marqueſs, I muſt tell you, that you alone can pay me in that manner as I deſire; and it is you alone that can oblige me to recount my laſt adventures. If you do not explain your ſelf better, anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> we ſhall not make up our match; but whereas the entertainment of the company is exceeding dear to me, tell me, what recompence do you demand? I deſire, ſaid he unto her, that before I relate that unto you which befell me, you will let us know what diſcontent that was which made you quit <hi>Genoua</hi> to go to <hi>Albengua;</hi> what moved you to marry a man whom you did not love, and baniſh one whom you did not hate: For to ſpeak freely unto you, it hath been imparted unto me at <hi>Genoua</hi> in ſuch a manner, as gives me a great deal of curioſity, and makes me deſire to know whether I have been told the truth or no. As for me, ſaid <hi>Hipolita,</hi> I have intended a long time ſince to intreat <hi>Leonida</hi> ſhe would acquaint me with it; but Fortune hath ſo cruelly perſecuted us, as we have ſcarce had any leaſure but to feel new miſeries, without remembring thoſe which were already paſt. Certainly, added <hi>Doria,</hi> it I durſt joyn my intreaties to thoſe of the Company, I would requeſt <hi>Leonida</hi> to grant us this favor. For my part, ſaid <hi>Sophronia,</hi> I have not the ſame curioſity, for I am ſo fully informed of this Hiſtory, as I do not know any thing that hath hapned to my ſelf better. If the company, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> to her, will needs know it, I ſhall make advantage of it if you will take the pains to relate it unto them; for as for me, I am fully reſolved not to expoſe my ſelf a ſecond time to the vexation which this relation hath been the cauſe of to me. Do not reproach my old error unto me, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> interrupting her; and to deliver you from this unquietneſs, and for fear leſt I ſhould find my ſelf too weak to hear a thing without grief which hath given me ſo much, I will go and walk in the Garden, or entertain my ſelf with a Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> after he had ſaid this, went without attending <hi>Leonida</hi>'s anſwer forth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, and would not return thither again, though the Marquiſs called him more then once. His abſence did not for all that change <hi>Leonida</hi>'s opinion, and whatſoever could be ſaid unto her, ſhe would not recount her own Hiſtory; but ſhe requeſted <hi>Sophronia</hi> to take the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it upon her. This fair maid, ſeeing that the whole company deſired this complacency of her, reſolved to ſatisfie them, after ſhe had prayed <hi>Leonida,</hi> that if ſhe forgot any thing ſhe would put her in mind of it; and <hi>Leonida,</hi> having promiſed her to do ſo, ſhe then made the Marquiſs to ſwear, that as ſoon as ever ſhe had finiſhed her relation, he ſhould begin his: And when as he had aſſured her that he would not fail therein, and had told her that he had at leaſtwiſe as much deſire to recount his adventures unto her, as ſhe had to know them, <hi>Sophroni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Adventures of <hi>Leonida</hi> have ſomething ſo extraordinary in them, as they are to be related in ſomewhat a particular manner; for to render the recital of them the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and intelligible unto you, I am not to ſay any thing to you yet of the beginning of her life, of her firſt Conqueſts, nor of her marriage, but only acquaint you with <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s love, which I believe took its beginning preſently upon <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s return, and a year and half after the death of <hi>Leonida</hi>'s husband. This Conqueſt without doubt was not diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto her; for, as you know, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> hath merit, wiſdom, and wit; and if after theſe, which certainly are the greateſt and moſt eſſential good things, it is fit to conſider the reſt, you are not ignorant that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> is rich enough, and of a race illuſtrious enough to touch a heart on the ſide of intereſt and glory, as well as of affection. <hi>In fine,</hi> whether <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> were capable of love or ambition, ſhe found in the perſon of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> wherewith to beget theſe two paſſions in her heart, and wherewith to render them excuſable. If <hi>Leonida</hi> were not preſent, I would tell you, that whereas ſhe hath a great deal of wit, Love in this encounter was introduced into her Soul rather by Reaſon, then by ſenſe and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>But not to ſtand upon ſmall things, you ſhall underſtand that <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeen ſo aſſidual in ſerving her, after he had rendred her all the teſtimonies of love, that a worthy perſon can deſire of a man infinitely paſſionate, he knew at length from her own mouth, that his vows were not rejected, and that he was not forbidden to hope. After the day that ſhe had permitted him to entertain her openly with his paſſion, it is certain that <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60144:202"/> had continually all the complacency for him, which a vertuous woman was capabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ovial humor, ſh oftentimes gave him the pleaſure to hear her jeer his Rivals in his preſence, and an hundred times made her Conqueſts ſerve for his glory. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> then lived in this ſort with more content, then the extream love which he bore her ſeemed to permit; for, as I have heard it ſaid, this paſſion ſeldom leaves any great tranquillity in the Souls of thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> he was the moſt generous Lover that ever was; his inclination had not been blind; all the world approved of his choyce; he loved an amiable perſon, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of her; ſhe took care not to give him any cauſe of jealouſie; his very Rivals ſerved for his delight and felicity by the uſage that ſhe gave them; his father did not contradict his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; <hi>Leonida</hi> was of a free condition, and might diſpoſe of her ſelf; yea and to keep him from being deprived of the pleaſure of hoping for the poſſeſſion of a perſon that could render him contented, <hi>Leonida,</hi> to aſſure her ſelf yet further of his love, would not ſo much as let him make uſe of his friends for the motioning of their marriage. In ſo happy an eſtate methinks it is hard to imagine what could trouble his felicity, eſpecially when I ſhall have told you, that <hi>Leonida</hi> uſed him ſtill as favorably as before, and without any change arriving in her, yet there arrived a change in him. I well perceive, continued <hi>Sophronia,</hi> after ſhe had been a while without ſpeaking, that you cannot divine what it was which troubled <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s happineſs; and certainly I cannot think it ſtrange, ſeeing according to my ſenſe this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is ſo extraordinary, as it is impoſſible to conjecture it. You ſhall underſtand then, that one day <hi>Alphonſo</hi> being gone to ſee a kinſman of his, whereas the perſon beloved is a part of all converſations, and a man infinitely amorous ſpeaks without choyce and judgment of his Miſtreſs to every one, he came to ſpeak of <hi>Leonida</hi> to his kinſman, though to ſay truth he was not worthy of that honor; for this man is both malicious and blockiſh; According then to his humor and ſtupidity he rudely asked of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> whether he beleeved that he had been the firſt which ever had been affected of <hi>Leonida?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had been a long time in the voyage, from whence <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> brought him back, he had underſtood nothing of what had hapned to <hi>Leonida,</hi> for being fallen in love with her preſently after his return, no body had been ſo uncivil as to ſay any ſuch thing to him. It was not, as you ſhall know by the ſequel of this Hiſtory, becauſe that which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto <hi>Leonida</hi> was not glorious for her; but becauſe love is a paſſion that renders the ſpirit ſo ſenſible and delicate, as it is impoſſible to hear that the perſon whom one loves, ſhould have affection for another, without ſome ſenſe of gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f. And verily <hi>Alphonſo</hi> tryed it but too well in this occaſion; he beleeved at firſt notwithſtanding, that this was an effect of the malice of his kinſman, who regarding his ſucceſsion, had perchance a deſign to do what he could for the rendring <hi>Leonida</hi> leſs amiable: but when as continuing his incivility he had told him, that one, named <hi>Octavio,</hi> of the Houſe of the <hi>Pallavicins,</hi> and who was dead ſince, had in times paſt loved her, and that he had been infinitely loved of her, he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that this man durſt have told him things ſo preciſely, if they had not been true.</p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> having made his viſit, retired with ſome unquietneſs; nevertheleſs, whereas he had not yet loſt his Reaſon, he did not find that he had any cauſe to complain of <hi>Leonida,</hi> for that ſhe had been loved of <hi>Octavio,</hi> or for that ſhe had loved him in a time when as he was not known to her. For, ſaid he, I ſhould be unjuſt to deſire, that the eyes of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> ſhould not have begun to make Conqueſts before they captivated me; and I ſhould be unreaſonable to deſire alſo that ſhe ſhould have been abſolutely inſenſible of the affection of a man, who it may be was of more worth then my ſelf. Now whereas Love is ingenious to torment thoſe which are under his Empire, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> did not complain of having a Rival, that had not been hated, but for that <hi>Leonida</hi> had made a ſecret of it to him: This unquietneſs was not for all that very ſtrong, but you ſhall underſtand by the ſequel of my diſcourſe, that it carried him to another, which put him to a great deal of pain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had no ſooner the commodity to ſpeak with <hi>Leonida</hi> in private, but making ſhew as if it were without deſign he took occaſion to name <hi>Octavio;</hi> this name, which had been ſo dear to <hi>Leonida,</hi> could not be heard of her without touching her heart; and her heart could not be moved, without giving ſome marks of it in her face: For her Senſe preventing her Reaſon, ſhe bluſht and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60144:202"/> from <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſhe layd her hand over her eyes, and endeavoring to change diſcourſe, he was thereby perſwaded, that this touched her heart exceeding ſenſibly; augmented his curioſity; and made him reſolve to teſtifie it to her plainly.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of ſo precipitous a deſign, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> without deferring the execution of it any further, ſaid unto her, I would fain, fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> be aſſured, that after my being dead for your ſervice, my name ſhould be ſo happy as to make you bluſh and ſigh, as the bleſſed <hi>Octavio's</hi> hath done. You ſhould do better, anſwered <hi>Leonida</hi> ſighing a ſecond time, to call him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Octavio.</hi> Whoſoever hath been loved of you, replyed <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> could n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I wiſh for all that, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you never make tryal of the like felicity: But, continued ſhe with an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered countenance, why have you ſpoken to me of <hi>Octavio?</hi> Let us leave him to enjoy that reſt which he could never finde in this life; let us not trouble ours in troubling his; and let us, I pray you, have ſo much regard to him, as to leave his aſhes in peace. Pleaſe you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> then unto her, if without loſing the reſpect which I owe to you, I dare crave of you, for a mark of your affection, that you will take the pains to relate exactly unto me, that which <hi>Octavio</hi> in times paſt bore unto you, that which you bore to him and briefly all that beſell you till the time of his death; otherwiſe you will give me cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of you. <hi>Leonida</hi> would not at firſt accord to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> that which he deſired of her; for as ſhe knew how highly her heart had been touched for <hi>Octavio,</hi> ſo ſhe know likewiſe that it would be impoſſible for her to remember all their felicities, and all their misfortunes, without a great deal of unquietneſs; wherefore ſhe excuſed her ſelf from it as much as ſhe could; nevertheleſs ſeeing that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> took this refuſal for a wrong, ſhe promiſed to grant him his deſire, ſo as he would give her ſome time; and in this ſort many days paſt away, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> being unable to make her keep her word with him, But at length, his curioſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown the ſtronger by <hi>Leonida</hi>'s reſiſtance, he teſtified unto her one day ſo ſeriouſly, that he ſhould hold himſelf diſobliged by her, if ſhe continued in the reſolution which ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have, as having appointed him a time to come to her for that purpoſe, ſhe reſolved to content him. If one had then demanded of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> why his curioſity was ſo ſtrong, he could not have told, at leaſt-wiſe he hath acknowledged ſo much to <hi>Leonida</hi> ſince: For whereas he was perſwaded that ſhe had loved <hi>Octavio,</hi> both by that which his Kinſman had told him, by that which he had alſo learned other-where concerning it, and by the marks which he had ſeen of it in her countenance, if in her ſpeech nevertheleſs ſhe had diſguiſed the truth, that lying would have given him a great deal of unquietn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But at laſt, carryed by a ſecret motion, which he could not reſiſt, he went with an extream impatience to the aſſignation which <hi>Leonida</hi> had given him. He found her more ſad then ordinary; for whereas her imagination was filled with diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>idea's,</hi> that charming and jovial ayr, which ſhe hath uſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After ſhe had cauſed <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to ſit down, and had told him, that ſhe was going to render him the greateſt proof of her affection that he had ever yet received, ſhe was ready to impart unto him what her fortune had been, when as <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> before he would give her leaſure ſo to do, conjured her once again not to omit any part of all that which had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto her. But he had no need to intreat her thereunto, for <hi>Leonida</hi> had no ſooner began to ſpeak, but forgetting that ſhe was recounting her Hiſtory to her Lover, ſhe ſuffered her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf to be charmed with her own relation; and ſhewing grief or joy, according as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which ſhe related gave her occaſion for, ſhe omitted not any thing of all that happened unto her. She imparted to him, that <hi>Octavio's</hi> houſe being neer to hers, ſhe had no ſoone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That their Fathers being friends, they had a thouſand times ſeen one another in that innocent age, wherein decency did not require one yet to live with ſo great a reſtraint; and that then, without knowing what it was to love, they ſorbore not carrying affection to each other. She told him further, that in this age, wherein feigning and diſſimulation have no part, and wherein the inclinations of the Soul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſuch as they are, ſo great a correſpondence was ſeen betwixt <hi>Octavio</hi>'s, and hers, as no difference could be found therein. But, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſighing, neither he nor I knew, that this ſympathy, which ſo ſtraitly united our hearts and mindes, ſhould diſunite us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;

We knew not as yet for all that, added ſhe, what thoſe thoughts were which we had one for the other; neither did we perceive them, till decency would not permit us to ſee one another ſo often. The privation of a good makes us know the greatneſs of it, and the deſign which we had to conceal our affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make me ſuſpect th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> there was ſomething in it more then good-will: I did then all that I could to diſengage my minde from a paſſion, which I had always heard to be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; but whereas it was more ancient in me then Reaſon, Reaſon was not ſtrong enough to chaſe it out of my Soul; but contrarily it was ſhe which engaged me further in it, and that ſpeaking to me of <hi>Octavio,</hi> drew the picture of the worthieſt man that ever was. She told him moreover that, which ſhe felt in her heart, when as by any reaſon of honor, or buſineſs, he was conſtrained to be abſent from <hi>Genoua;</hi> the ſmall delight ſhe took in Aſſemblies when he was not there; and how much ſhe enforced her ſelf to ſeem merry during his abſence. She acquainted him alſo, how exact <hi>Octavio</hi> was in following her pleaſure in all things; what care he uſed to take from her all occaſion of ſuſpecting his fidelity; and with what diſcretion he ſtill demeaned himſelf towards her all the time of his ſerving her.</p>
                  <p>But, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> interrupting her, had you never any of thoſe petty diſorders, which augment love, rather then diminiſh it? No, no, anſwered <hi>Leonida, Octavio</hi> never gave me cauſe to complain; beſides, our affection had no need of that artifice to render it the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſince it is certain that never any perſon loved more perfectly then we. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> would fain have aſſured <hi>Leonida,</hi> that he loved her yet better then <hi>Octavio</hi> had loved her, but his minde was ſo unquiet, as he could ſcarce ſpeak. And then again, <hi>Leonida</hi> gave him not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to do it; for ſhe was ſo attentive in exactly relating all that had paſt betwixt <hi>Octavio</hi> and her, as ſhe never took heed of all the ſeveral changes which her diſcourſe made in his face. She continued then telling him, that after an indifferent long love, <hi>Octavio,</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion of her to demand her of her parents, believed that his happineſs was ſo ſure, as he had no doubt at all of it; for whereas his Father and hers had always lived as good friends together, and their fortunes were equal, he could foreſee no impediment in it. But he knew not, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> then looking on <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that a paſſion leſs noble then that which raigned in his heart oppoſed his; and that avarice, which is far more powerful in the mindes of old men, then love is in that of young folks, ſhould deſtroy his and my hopes, and ſhould finiſh our love by his death, for to ſettle a grief in my ſoul, which I ſhall conſerve there eternally.</p>
                  <p>In ſequel hereof, <hi>Leonida</hi> likewiſe declared to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that one named <hi>Livio,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Frigozes,</hi> a man very rich in the goods of fortune, but very poor in thoſe of the minde, being touched with her beauty, without any thought of diſcovering his affection to her, or gaining her favor, went the very ſame day that he fell in love with her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her of her Father: preſcribing him no other conditions, then that of giving him his daughter; and that this old man, who knew <hi>Livio</hi>'s wealth, being more mightily touched with the love of riches, then <hi>Livio</hi> was with the beauty of <hi>Leonida,</hi> had promiſed him to beſtowed her on him, and had engaged his word to him in ſuch ſort, as nothing was able to make him break it. So that <hi>Octavio</hi> arriving an hour after that <hi>Livio</hi> was gone, and making his propoſition, he was wonderfully ſurprized to learn from <hi>Leonida</hi>'s Father, that he had promiſed his daughtar, and that it would be in vain for him to hope he might make him change his reſolution. <hi>Octavio</hi> could not apprehend, that <hi>Leonida</hi> could be promiſed to any one, and ſhe not know of it; and on the other ſide, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> my fidelity was ſo well known to him, as he durſt not doubt of it. In ſo deplorable an eſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, he left my Father, and came and found me out at an Aunts of mine, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored our affection, and where I had appointed him to come and acquaint me with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he ſhould receive. But O Heaven I cryed ſhe, I did not foreſee that this ſentence ſhould be that of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s death, and of the loſs of all the felicity that I attended from it. He came then, but with ſo much melancholy in his face, as at firſt I made no doubt but that he had ſome fatal news to impart unto me: When as he had obtained permiſſion of his grief to ſpeak to me, and that he had acquainted me, that not onely I ſhould not be his, but that I was already anothers, my affliction was ſo ſtrong, that albeit <hi>Octavio</hi>'s was exceeding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60144:203"/> great, yet was it for him notwithſtanding to comfort me. He told me that our misfortune it may be was not without remedy; and that if I had as much ſtedfaſtneſs, as he had love, I ſhould vanquiſh my Fathers rigor. Alaſs! ſaid I unto him ſighing, I will not bewail the tears which I ſhall ſhed, if they may move his cruelty: but if they prove unprofitable to me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, what arms ſhall I make uſe of? Of thoſe of your conſtancy, ſaid the infortunate <hi>Octavio</hi> to me. Alaſs! cryed <hi>Leonida</hi> in making this relation to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> how often have I repented me for not believing him I and rather chuſing to obey my Father, then to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to my Lover.</p>
                  <p>After this tranſport of affection, ſhe recounted unto him all the reſiſtances ſhe had made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Parents pleaſure; her grief and deſpair, when as ſhe ſaw that neither her prayers, her tears, nor her reaſons could avail; the pain ſhe was in not to grant <hi>Octavio</hi> the permiſſion to ſteal her away, or to rid himſelf of his Rival; and for a concluſion, ſhe acquainted him, how the tyranny of her Father, and the conſideration of her honor, having forced her to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon <hi>Octavio,</hi> to marry <hi>Livio,</hi> ſhe ſaw her ſelf in ſo deplorable an eſtate, as that which would have made up the bittereſt grief of another, was her onely conſolation. For, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> I had no other in this encounter, then to know that I marryed a man whom I could never love, no not if time ſhould cure me of the paſſion I was in. It was not becauſe I was not reſolved for my own glory to live well with him, but becauſe I had at leaſt-wiſe this conſolation, that <hi>Octavio</hi> could not ſuſpect me of infidelity; yea and I hoped too, that the more pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But in the end, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> unto her, you marryed <hi>Livio?</hi> Yes, anſwered <hi>Leonida</hi> with tears; and the infortunate <hi>Octavio,</hi> unable to reſolve to ſee me in the poſſeſſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, departed from <hi>Genoua</hi> to go and ſeek for the death which he found ſoon after. For although I had done an hundred things beyond what was fitting, to oppoſe my ſelf againſt my Fathers will, yet he believed with reaſon, notwithſtanding he knew that I loved nothing but him, that ſeeing I could not be marryed without mine own conſent, I ſhould never have granted it, and that I ſhould rather have reſolved to dye, then abandon him. In ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a thought, deſpair ſeizing on his ſoul, he went to the Emperors Army, and arrived there ſo unluckily, both for himſelf, and for me, and ſo opportunely for the deſign which he had, that the next day there was a battel ſought; but before he entred into it, he deſired to let me underſtand, that he went not ſo much to expoſe his life for the Emperor, as for the love of me. In ſaying ſo, <hi>Leonida</hi> let him ſee the Letter which <hi>Octavio</hi> had written unto her; and whereas I have found it extreamly moving, and that it is not long, I think if I do not remember the words preciſely, I ſhall meet with at leaſt-wiſe the true ſence of it.</p>

But alaſs, he dyed rather by my hand, then by the Enemies! After this, ſaid ſhe, I concealed our affection no longer, and I gave ſo many marks of deſpair, as my Father himſelf repented his having rendted me ſo unhappy. A while after, <hi>Livio</hi> fell ſick and dyed, and left me the liberty to weep. Behold <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> unto him, with as much grief as if <hi>Octavio</hi> had dyed the very ſame day, that which you deſired to know of me; but never ſpeak to me more of him, I beſeech you; for as you perceive there is a kinde of inhumanity in renewing ſo ſenſible an affliction in my heart, and for which I ſhould never be comforted, had I not found in you ſome reſemblance of the humor and diſpoſſion of the infortunate <hi>Octavio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonida,</hi> having finiſhed her relation, and wiped her eyes, thanked <hi>Alphonſo</hi> for the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which appeared in his countenance; imagining that it was an effect of the compaſſion he took of her paſt misfortunes. But ſhe knew not, that the ſame which ſhe believed to be a ſenſe of pity, was one of the moſt violent jealouſies that ever an amorous ſpirit was tormented with. For he ſo ſtrongly perſwaded himſelf that <hi>Leonida</hi> could not have the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions for him, which ſhe had had for <hi>Octavio,</hi> as he went away from her, with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction the like whereof was never ſeen; yet he left her without giving her any notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but when he was come home, and had ſhut himſelf up alone in his Chamber, he ran over all that, word for word, which <hi>Leonida</hi> had told him, for they had made ſo powerful in impreſſion in his Soul, as I think there eſcaped not ſo much as one out of his memory. The more he conſidered the matter, the more was he confirmed in his jealouſie. He remembred, that ſhe had loved <hi>Octavio,</hi> out of ſympathy, out of acknowledgment, and out of reaſon; that their affection began from their infancy, and continued all their life. Now, ſaid he to himſelf, <hi>Octavio</hi> is not dead in the heart of <hi>Leonida,</hi> he lives there ſtill in deſpite of me, and in ſuch a manner as I cannot chaſe him from thence. He is not onely dead to keep me from being revenged of him, but he is alſo dead to raign eternally in her ſoul. For, added he, quite tranſported with grief, infortunate <hi>Alphonſo, Leonida</hi> loves thee not neither but for the love of him; thou knoweſt it from her own mouth, and thou canſt not doubt of thy unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Ah how wretched I am, continued he, and how Imprudent have I been in laboring mine own ruine my ſelf I if I had not been curious, I had been the happieſt of men, and I have rendred my ſelf the moſt infortunate that ever was. That which I have ſeen, that which I have heard; the tears of <hi>Leonida,</hi> her ſighs, her ſpeeches, and the marks of love and tenderneſs, which ſhe hath rendred to the memory of <hi>Octavio,</hi> have not onely deſtroyed my preſent pleaſures, and all thoſe which I hoped for, but alſo my pleaſures paſt. I no longer marvel, continued he, if <hi>Leonida</hi> ill-intreats my Rivals, it is for the aſhes of <hi>Octavio</hi> that ſhe hath this reſpect and this fidelity, and not for me. O bleſſed <hi>Octavio,</hi> cryed he, how worthy of envy is thy fate, and how unhappy is mine! This fantaſtical jealouſie got ſuch deep rooting in his heart, as he loſt all reſt, and almoſt his Reaſon. He wiſhed ſometimes that <hi>Octavio</hi> were ſtill living, to the end he might be revenged of him; and by and by after in another quite contrary thought he conſidered, that if he had been living <hi>Leonida</hi> had never loved him, and in this manner he was in ſome ſort glad that he was dead. Sometimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he comforted himſelf for that <hi>Leonida</hi> had not loved <hi>Octavio</hi> ſo much as to marry him againſt the will of her Parents; but then when he came to remember the laſt marks of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which <hi>Leonida</hi> had received from <hi>Octavio,</hi> and what reſentment ſhe had teſtified for it in relating it to him, he entred into deſpair again. What can I do, ſaid he, that can ever perſwade her that I love her as well as <hi>Octavio!</hi> When I ſhall tell her, that ſhe raigns in my heart; that her will may diſpoſe of mine; that ſhe is abſolute Miſtreſs of my ſoul; and in concluſion, that I live not but for her alone; with one onely word, ſhe will ſet <hi>Octavio</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that I have ſaid; for telling me that he dyed to teſtifie his affection to her, is to tell me, that he hath incomparably done more then I; that he raigns always in her minde; and that I can never pretend to the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>Of all the thoughts that afflicted <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that of his not being loved by <hi>Leonida</hi> but becauſe he had ſome conformity with <hi>Octavio,</hi> was the moſt inhumane; and the opinion which he had, that ſince this was the cauſe of his Miſtreſſes affection, ſhe could not therefore ſee him without remembring <hi>Octavio,</hi> troubled him in ſuch fort, as he continued certain days unable to reſolve to viſit her. Nevertheleſs there were ſome inſtants, wherein he condemned his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60144:204"/> tranſports; and demanding of himſelf what he deſired of <hi>Leonida</hi> in this occaſion? he knew not very well what he would have; but theſe good intervals laſted ſo little it while, as it might have been ſaid that he had no reſt at all. If I had a Rival, ſaid he ſometimes, I ſhould ſpend a part of my anguiſh in ſeeking occaſion to hurt him, and to ſet him at odds with her I loved, and whom he ſhould love; I ſhould obſerve their actions, and knowing them, I ſhould make uſe of them, either to trouble their deſigns, or to advance mine, or to cure me of my paſsion. But is the caſe ſtands, I have a ſecret Rival in the heart of <hi>Leonida,</hi> whom ſhe entertains, I not knowing, nor being able to hinder it: She weeps, ſhe ſighs, even as ſhe is talking with me, for this bleſſed Phantoſm, which ſhe loves ſtill, and ever will love, ſince he is no longer in a condition to be able to do any thing that can diſpleaſe her. As for me, ſaid he, I am in far other terms; for I can eaſily diſpleaſe her, and I cannot be agreeable unto her, but becauſe I reſemble <hi>Octavio.</hi> Who ever ſaw, continued he, ſuch another thing? I am jealous, and yet I have no Rival; I am beloved, and yet I am not happy; and through an extravagancy of my deſtiny, or of my humor, I ſhall never be; let <hi>Leonida</hi> do what ſhe will, it is impoſsible that ever I ſhould be ſo. For ſay I ſhould marry her, it would always run in my mind, that if by a miracle <hi>Octavio</hi> could riſe again, ſhe would abandon me for him: Yea and I beleeve, added he, that if ſhe could buy his life with my death, ſhe would conſent unto it with joy.</p>
                  <p>This deadly thought ſeized ſo ſtrongly on <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s heart, as there were certain moments in which he had as much hatred for <hi>Leonida,</hi> as he was capable of. For whereas this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary jealouſie agitated all his paſsions, and principally hate and anger, not finding a nearer object to employ them upon, he had for her no doubt very different thoughts, and wholly repleniſhed with violence. Love remained nevertheleſs ſtill victorious over all the reſt, or to ſpeak more rightly, all thoſe ſeveral paſsions were but effects of that ſame.</p>
                  <p>But in the end, after <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had ſpent ſome days in the entertainment of his anguiſh of mind, without ſeeing <hi>Leonida,</hi> the extream love which he bore her, carried him to her whether he would or no. He hath told her ſince, that being gone out of his lodging, with an intent to walk in ſome place out of the way, that he might muſe by himſelf better then at home, and exactly run over all the favors which <hi>Leonida</hi> had conferred on him, to the end he might compare them with thoſe which <hi>Octavio</hi> had received from her; he acquainted her, I ſay, that againſt his purpoſe, and without being aware of it, his ſteps conducted him to her door, where he no ſooner was, but without conſulting what he was to do, he knocked there, and underſtanding that <hi>Leonida</hi> was within, he went up directly to her chamber without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing her of it, though it was not his cuſtom ſo to do; for <hi>Leonida</hi> ſeldom ever ſaw him at her houſe, when ſhe was alone there; but at this time <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was not in a caſe regularly to obſerve good manners. When as <hi>Leonida</hi> firſt ſaw him, ſhe received him ſomewhat cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for whereas he had been a good while without ſending to her, or enquiring after her, ſhe thought it was but juſt to uſe him ſo.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> how diſordered ſoever his mind was, yet durſt he not make ſhew at the beginning of that which he had in his heart; for reſpect and Reaſon had ſo much power over him, is he could not reſolve to diſcover his ſuffering to a perſon who cauſed it, until he ſhould be extreamly preſſed thereunto by her. After <hi>Leonida</hi> had received him ſomewhat coldly, and had obſerved the change which jealouſie had made in <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s face, the anger wherein ſhe was in for his neglect turned into unquietneſs. She was afraid left ſome miſhap had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him; or through ſome adventure, which was unknown to her, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſhould accuſe her unjuſtly of ſome defect of affection: In this belief ſhe uſed him more favorably; asked of him whether his melancholy was feigned or true; and urging him to anſwer her, ſhe forced him to tell her a lye, in ſuch perplexed and obſcure terms, as ſhe doubted not but that he had ſome unpleaſing thought in his mind. She employed all her addreſs then to diſcover it by the ſeveral queſtions ſhe asked him: but ſeeing ſhe nothing prevailed thereby, and that the more ſhe demanded of him, the leſs ſhe was ſatisfied, ſhe did him the favor to deal with him as a M ſtreſs, and abſolutely commanded him to tell her what that trouble was which he had in his Soul. You have aſſured me an hundred times, ſaid ſhe unto him, that I could do any thing with you, and that your heart was not ſo much in your own diſpoſe as in mine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, if you have not deceived me, do you not obey me? When as I promiſed you that which you ſay, replyed <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> I hoped that I might, if not raign in your heart, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not be ſurmounted there by any body.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:60144:205"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonida</hi> perceiving then, that jealouſie was the diſeaſe that tormented him, and knowing that ſhe had given him no reaſonable occaſion for it, fell a ſmiling, and reaching him her hand with that gallantry, which is ſo natural unto her, Affict not your ſelf, ſaid this amiable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor fear that I will be diſpleaſed to underſtand that you are jealous; I know, ſaid ſhe unto him ſtill ſmiling, that we fear to loſe the good which is extream dear to us; that jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie is an undoubted ſign of a ſtrong paſſion, and of the merit of the perſon whom one loves, becauſe if ſhe were not amiable ſhe would have no Lovers, and conſequently ſhe would give no cauſe of jealouſie. And I am the leſs offended, continued ſhe, to ſee you touched with this paſſion, in regard it is eaſie for me to help you. For to ſpeak more ſeriouſly to you, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Leonida,</hi> you have no Rivals which can keep me from giving you the pleaſure when you will to hear me termed by them, cruel, inhumane, rigorous, and inexorable. <hi>In fine,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, you have a malady, whereof you ſhall no ſooner have acquainted me with the cauſe, but you ſhall be cured of it.</p>
                  <p>I do not think, anſwered <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> with as much anguiſh, as <hi>Leonida</hi> had gallantry, that it is as eaſie for you to reſtore tranqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I do not underſtand you, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> to him with more coldneſs then before; and if you do not explain your ſelf better, I ſhall beleeve that either you have loſt your Reaſon, or that with a premeditated deſign you purpoſe to break off with me: But take heed <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> of leaving me long in this ſuſpicion, for fear leſt, whereas I am proud and diſdainful, I do not prevent you, and it be too late for you then to have recourſe to my goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſurprized both with <hi>Leonida</hi>'s diſcourſe, and the manner wherewith ſhe ſpake, reſolved at length freely to tell her the cauſe of his grief. I know very well, ſaid he unto her, that I am going to ſpeak in vain for my ſelf, and indeed it is rather out of deſpair then Reaſon that I am carried to obey you. Know then, continued he, that I am jealous, and that I ſhall be ſo eternally, ſince the Rival that ſurmounts me in your heart can never dye; for to conceal the truth from you no longer, the bleſſed <hi>Octavio</hi> is the object of my jealouſie. The tears which you ſhed for his memory are the cauſe of thoſe which I ſhall pour forth all my life time; the ſighs which you fetch for him, ſhall always make me ſigh; and his paſt felicity ſhall beget the miſery of all the reſt of my days. You have loved him ſo much, continued he, and you love him ſo much ſtill, that I can find no place in your Soul: He much raign there alone, for indeed you do not ſuffer me there but only to conſerve the memory of him the better. Ah cruel man! cryed <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing him ſpeak in this ſort, is it poſſible that you have the inhumanity to open the Tomb of <hi>Octavio</hi> to perſecute me? and in ſtead of weeping with me, or at leaſtwiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning and comforting me, you are ſo audacious as to give me marks of your hatred to a perſon, whom I have ſo much loved, and whoſe memory is ſtill ſo dear unto me; and yet in grateful as you are, ſaid ſhe to him, you owe the affection which I bear you to that little reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance you have with <hi>Octavio;</hi> but as this infortunate creature hath been the cauſe of it, ſo ſhall he likewiſe give an end to it: for in regard of that which you have ſaid to me, I ordain you never to ſpeak to me, and never to ſee me more. Why do not you ſhut your ſelf up then in <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Tomb, anſwered <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſince you can love none but him? Reply no further to me, inhumane that you are, ſaid ſhe to him, and take from my ſight the perſecutor of <hi>Leonida,</hi> and the enemy of <hi>Octavio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſeeing <hi>Leonida</hi> in ſuch choller, and not able to give her a good reaſon, either for the maintaining of his error, or for the obtaining of his pardon, went away more jealous then before. Alas, ſaid he to himſelf, how ſenſible ſhe is on that ſide I what a powerful mark of her love is her choller! if ſhe had loved me, ſhe would have uſed me after another manner; ſhe would have taken pity of my weakneſs; ſhe would have given me ſome new proof of her affection; but ſhe could not diſguiſe her heart; all her thoughts have been for <hi>Octavio,</hi> and all her words have been againſt me. In this opinion <hi>Alphonſo</hi> got him home, with an intent to obey <hi>Leonida</hi> exactly, and never to ſee her again. As indeed he came no more at her, and that be might avoyd meeting with her any where, he feigned himſelf ſick. <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what a madneſs this ill-grounded jealouſie carried him, deſired at leaſtwiſe to conceal it from the eyes of the world; and to that effect ſhe advanced a voyage which ſhe was to make to <hi>Albengua,</hi> where, as you know, ſhe hath ſome means and affairs. She departed then from
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60144:205"/> 
                     <hi>Genoua,</hi> ſo incenſed againſt <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that ſhe could not ſo much as reſolve to do him the favor to complain of him by a Letter. Her departure did not cure <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of his frenſie, but contrarily it augmented it; for he beleeved that <hi>Leonida</hi> did not abandon <hi>Genoua,</hi> but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail <hi>Octavio</hi> with the more liberty. This thought for all that was not the moſt powerful in his heart; the impoſſibility of ſeeing <hi>Leonida,</hi> redoubled his deſire of it, and love being ſtronger ſtill then jealouſie, he purpoſed an hundred times to go to <hi>Albengua,</hi> to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at <hi>Leonida</hi>'s feet; to crave her pardon; and to obtain an oblivion of his fault of her. But no ſooner did the Phantom of <hi>Octavio</hi> preſent it ſelf to his imagination, no ſooner did he call the tears and ſighs of <hi>Leonida</hi> to remembrance, but he re-entred into his former furies. He made an hundred impoſſible wiſhes, which deſtroyed one another, and led a very irkſom and melancholick life. During that time he wrote divers Letters to <hi>Leonida,</hi> according to the divers thoughts wherein he was; but when as ſhe perceived ſo great an inequality in his mind, and ſuch marks of an unſetled Reaſon, ſhe returned no anſwer thereunto; and although ſhe loved <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſo much, as to be extreamly grieved to loſe him, yet could ſhe not imagine how ſhe might cure him of this fantaſie: ſo that finding no expedient for it, and being very much incenſed againſt him, ſhe lived with ſo much anguiſh, that if <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had known her moſt ſecret thoughts, he would have been healed of his jealouſie, and would have been aſſured that ſhe did not grieve more for the death of <hi>Octavio,</hi> then for the loſs of his affection. It was in this ſort then that <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> lived until that infortunate day, wherein we were conſtrained to forſake <hi>Genoua.</hi> And I make no doubt but that <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s deſpair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to follow us, as well as the generoſity which he teſtified to us in this occaſion, in not abandoning us in the ſorrow we were in, ſince he abſented himſelf from a place where <hi>Leonida</hi> was not. You know in like manner, what that Tempeſt was, which luckily for him drove us to <hi>Albengua;</hi> neither are you ignorant how the compaſſion and generoſity of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> obliged her to imbarque her ſelf with us: But doubtleſs you do not know, what <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>'s and her thoughts were, when as, after they had had the goodneſs to lament our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, they had the leaſure to think of the terms wherein they ſtood. For whereas we had ſcarcely been upon the Sea without a Tempeſt, without fear of death, and without extream ſorrow for the loſs we ſuſtained there, they had never talked together in private during this troubleſom Navigation; but when we were at <hi>Marocco,</hi> and at thoſe times, wherein we had the liberty to ſee and ſpeak to one another, <hi>Leonida,</hi> who deſired to conceal the terms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe was with <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> entertaining him with indifferent things, found that his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was as deeply wounded at <hi>Marocco,</hi> as it had been at <hi>Genoua,</hi> with this difference nevertheleſs, that at the firſt time he ſpake to her he moved her to anger, and the ſecond time he moved her to pity. What is the reaſon, ſaid he to he with tears, that I can neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue loving you, nor begin to hate you? and wherefore, ſince you are capable of ſome affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me, muſt I not only ſhare it with another, but I muſt owe it wholly to him? and without being able, either to change my paſſion, or revenge my ſelf, I muſt eternally be the moſt wretched of men.</p>
                  <p>He that impoſeth a neceſſity on himſelf, replyed <hi>Leonida,</hi> cannot complain with reaſon, ſeeing he himſelf is the cauſe of the evil that arriveth to him. Ah, cryed <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that you ſaid true! and that I could diſpoſe of my thoughts! Yes, <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſaid he unto her, would I could love you leſs, to the end I might love you always, and live happily in ſharing your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with another: But to endure, that in ſpeaking to me you ſhould always think of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> that whil'ſt I ſigh for love, you ſhould ſigh for affliction, and having abſolutely given you my heart, I ſhould have but a piece of yours, is that which I cannot ſuffer. But how is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> interrupting him, unjuſt and cruel <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that a man, who is no longer in an eſtate to have any affection for me, can give you jealouſie? You do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, replyed he, what is the true cauſe of jealouſie; the affection Which any one ſhould bear you, would not diſpleaſe me; it is of your thoughts that I am jealous, and not of thoſe of others. I would be willing chat you ſhould be loved, and that you ſhould be adored, but I would have you love none but me. I ſhould not care to ſee you have an hundred Lovers, provided I were alone in your heart; I do not hate my Rivals in their perſon, but in yours only; it is you that can increaſe or diminiſh the hatred which I have for them, by the good or bad uſage you ſhall give them; and whereas you may love <hi>Octavio</hi> as well, though he is not in being, as if he were living, you are not to think it ſtrange that I am jealous. <hi>In fine,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60144:206"/> continued he, you reduce me to thoſe terms, that I had rather you ſhould not love me at all, ſo as you would love nothing, then to love me as you do, in loving <hi>Octavio</hi> better then me. But <hi>Octavio</hi> is no longer in being, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> to him ſighing. Yet he is ſtill in your Soul, anſwered <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and this ſigh which you fetched teſtifies it but too much unto me. No, no, <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſaid he unto her, that which I ſuffer is without remedy; one may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make preſent miſhaps ceaſe, and decline thoſe which may happen unto us in time to come, but when we are unhappy by the remembrance of that which is paſt, death alone can finiſh our pains: It is not in your power to forbear ſighing, ſhedding of tears, and to ſay all, loving of <hi>Octavio</hi> more then <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> wherefore marvel not if it be not in your power to cure my mind of the jealouſie that poſſeſſeth it.</p>
                  <p>It was much after this ſort that the firſt converſation ended, which <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had together at <hi>Marocco.</hi> But whereas <hi>Leonida</hi> affected him, and ſaw the eſtate whereunto this fantaſtical jealouſie reduced him, ſhe opened her heart to me, and having asked my advice what ſhe ſhould do, I counſelled her, I think, as ſhe deſired to be, and as indeed was juſt. I told her then, that ſhe was to do all that ſhe could to ſet his heart at reſt! that this capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiouſneſs proceeding meerly from an exceſs of love, ſhe was to pardon ſo bad an effect, ſince it came from ſo noble a cauſe, and labor to reſtore his Reaſon to him, which ſhe had deprived him of. I agree with you, ſaid ſhe unto me, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> is to be eaſed, but in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do you think I may do it? if he were jealous of the <hi>French</hi> Marquiſs, of <hi>Doria,</hi> or of any other, it would not be difficult for me to ſatisfie him. The coldneſs which I would ſhew to them, ſhould ſoon ſet him at reſt; and if there were no other means for it, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my ſelf abſolutely of their company to preſerve it; but as the caſe ſtands I know no remedy for it. It is from my ſelf that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> hath learnt the affection which I have born to <hi>Octavio,</hi> I cannot unſay it; and if I ſhould be ſo baſe as to ſwear to him that I have not loved him ſo much as he imagines, I ſhould tell a lye to no purpoſe; it being very certain that he would give more credit to my tears, then to my latter ſpeeches; and then again, that is a thing I could never do. Counſel me then, continued ſhe, how I ſhall carry my ſelf. I profeſs unto you, that I was then very much perplexed what counſel to give her, for I ſaw no aſſured means that could cure <hi>Alphonſo:</hi> Nevertheleſs after I had muſed a little, my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that the only thing which ſhe could do was, to endeavor to perſwade <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that ſhe loved him as much as ſhe had loved <hi>Octavio,</hi> as indeed, I think I did not oblige her to tell an untruth.</p>
                  <p>At firſt <hi>Leonida</hi> told me that this would ſerve to no purpoſe, but finding nothing to ſtand with more reaſon, ſhe reſolved to follow my advice: So that the firſt time ſhe could ſpeak with <hi>Alphonſo</hi> in private, his melancholy ſtill increaſing, ſhe demanded of him, whether he were reſolved to live long in that manner? Truly no, anſwered he, for I do not doubt, but from the miſery which I feel, death will come ſhortly and deliver me. Is it not poſſible, ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſhould make uſe of his Reaſon in this encounter? I perceive very well, anſwered he, that you have ſome pity of the hurt you have done me, but know that it is not that which I deſire; in the eſtate wherein <hi>Octavio</hi> is I could endure that you ſhould have compaſſion for him, provided you would have affection for me; but I could not endure, that you ſhould have love for him, &amp; have nothing but pity for <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> What change, ſaid ſhe unto him, is there come to me, ſince the time that you were contented with my affection? have I loved <hi>Octavio</hi> more, or have I loved you leſt then I did? in no wiſe at all, I ſwear unto you. Wherfore then ſince I am not changed for you, are you changed for me? If I had known my unhappineſs ſooner, replyed he, I ſhould have been leſs unhappy; it being certain, that I ſhould not have engaged my ſelf ſo ſtraitly in the love of a perſon, that could never love ſo much as ſhe had loved. It is true, ſaid ſhe unto him, that I have loved <hi>Octavio</hi> as much as I was able to love in the age wherein I was; and it is true alſo that his memory is dear and precious unto me: but who hath told you that I have not the ſame thoughts for you? I know it from your own mouth, replyed he; for in having aſſured me that you loved me leſs then he, you have let me underſtand that you have done that for his conſideration, which you have never done for mine. You loved him as ſoon as ever you opened your eyes, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> unto her; he was agreeable unto you as ſoon as ever you knew him; and your Reaſon hath told you ſince, that you would have done out of choyce, what you had done out of inclination; he hath had the happineſs to pleaſe you always, without ever giving you cauſe to be diſpleaſed; you have ſighed for him
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60144:206"/> in divers occaſions; you have many times bewailed his abſence as much, as I could pretend to be lamented by you, if I had loſt my life in your ſervice, and for my laſt unhappineſs he dyed in ſpeaking to you of love. It may be, if he had lived longer, you would have repented the tears, which now you ſhed for him; but as the caſe ſtands, there is a ſhadow of <hi>Octavio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, which is in ſtead of his perſon to you, that poſſeſſes your ſoul, and will not ſuffer you to have ſuch thoughts for another.</p>
                  <p>How unjuſt you are, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> unto him, to ſpeak to me thus! howſoever, ſince I am reſolved to try whether I can draw your minde out of that diſorder, whereunto, this ſtrange jealouſie hath carryed it, promiſe me, that if by my diſcourſe I can let you ſee, that you have received more teſtimonies of my affection, then I have given to the infortunte <hi>Octavio,</hi> you will then repent you of your error, reſtore tranquillity to your ſoul, and leave mine in reſt. <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> after he had withſtood it a while, in ſaying, that ſhe propounded an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing to him, and by conſequence he was not to anſwer unto it, reſolved for all that to hear her, and promiſed her that if ſhe kept her word with him, he would crave pardon to his fault, and would live better for the future. After they had made this agreement; tell me, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, if I can make it appear to you, that ſince the day wherein I permitted you to ſerve me, you never have had occaſion to complain of me; and if I can ſhew you, that the unhappy <hi>Octavio,</hi> if he were living, might with juſtice accuſe me of little affection; would you not have reaſon then to be contented? That will not be enough, anſwered <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> for it may be that you have never given me juſt cauſe to complain, and that you have given <hi>Octavio</hi> occaſion ſo to do, and yet for all that I cannot be happy: But that which I deſire is, you would let me know, that you have not done any thing for <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> which you would not have done for me, and that I think will not be eaſie for you to perform.</p>
                  <p>I will peradventure ſhew you yet more, replyed <hi>Leonida,</hi> and to begin to cure you, is it not true, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that the original of the affection which I bear to you, is far more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to you, then that which I have born <hi>Octavio?</hi> when I began to wiſh him well, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, I was in an age, wherein perchance that which I then called love, was none; wherein I counted for great ſervices petty things, which now I ſhould not regard; and wherein I acted without knowledg, and without judgment. I, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> interrupting her, but not without inclination, which is that which renders affections the ſtronger and more durable. I agree with you therein, ſaid ſhe unto him, but howſoever I had this inclination in an age, wherein at firſt my reaſon did not combat with it, for I had none at that time. That is the cauſe, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> why it is ſo will ſetled in your ſoul. And that is the cauſe, replyed <hi>Leonida,</hi> why I do not know whether it were any whit ſtrong, ſince I did not make reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt it. But as for you <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> when as you began to pleaſe me, and that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination carryed me to like of your ſervices, I was in an age wherein my Reaſon was in a condition to oppoſe it ſelf againſt it; as indeed, it did reſiſt it as much as it could. You had to vanquiſh in my heart, not onely that wiſdom and that modeſty, which permits not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to engage her ſelf lightly in affection to a man; but had alſo the memory of <hi>Octavio</hi> to ſurmount, in forcing me, if one may ſay ſo, to commit a greater infidelity againſt him, then when as I abandoned him to obey my Father; ſeeing it is certain that I marryed <hi>Livio</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving him, and that I could not keep the promiſe which I had made to my ſelf, never to love any thing more after the death of <hi>Octavio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe is very ſubtil, replyed <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> but have you not told me that you did not love me but becauſe I reſembled <hi>Octavio?</hi> I have indeed told you, anſwered ſhe, that by this reſemblance you comforted me for the loſs of <hi>Octavio;</hi> but not, that this conformity, which you have with him, was the onely cauſe of the good-will which I bear you. And <hi>certes,</hi> to ſpeak truly, ſince I muſt retract what I have ſaid with ſhame, if there had been no other then this reaſon. and that my inclination, your ſervices, and your merit, had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me; I ſhould rather have avoyded the ſight of you, then ſought it: It was not ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You make me new wounds, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo</hi> thereupon to her, in ſeeking to cure the old; for if it be true that you have this intention, why do you tell me that the ſight alone of one of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s pictures hath made you weep? I told it you, replyed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60144:207"/> ſhe, to let you ſee, that a man which could comfort me for ſo exceſſive a grief muſt needs have a great deal of power over my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> not able to contradict <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſuffered her to continue her diſcourſe. You perceive very well then, ſaid ſhe unto him, that in the beginning of our good-will I gave you more marks of a ſtrong inclination, then ever <hi>Octavio</hi> received of me, ſeeing when I loved him, I was in an age, wherein flattery, complacency, and gallantry, do extreamly touch the minde. <hi>Octavio</hi> was my firſt conqueſt, and the firſt man that told me I had ſomething that was pleaſing in me: and by this reaſon, it was almoſt impoſſible for me not to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of his affection: But for yours, I accepted of it in ſuch a manner, as would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to doubt of mine, if you be reaſonable. And to paſs from the beginning to the progreſs of it, tell me, I pray you, what is that I have done for him as long as he lived? All things, anſwered <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> and whereas more marks of affection are given by grief, then by joy, without running over all the complacencies which you have had for him, I will only ſay that you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve wept an hundred times for him, and that all the love which I have born you hath not coſt you a tear.</p>
                  <p>It is not time yet to diſcover my weakneſs unto you, replyed <hi>Leonida;</hi> and to anſwer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to that which you ſay, as long as we lived well together, it is true that I have not wept, but it was becauſe you were not unhappy; and I doubt not but if our affection had been thwarted as <hi>Octavio</hi>'s and mine was, I ſhould have had the ſame ſorrow. And then again you have this advantage over that infortunate man, that I have not forſaken you, as I did him; for indeed if I had known how to love perfectly, I had not marryed <hi>Livio,</hi> I had not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Octavio,</hi> I had not been the cauſe of his death. Therefore it is, anſwered <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that to repair that failing, in not loving <hi>Octavio</hi> enough, you love his aſhes and his Tomb; you cannot ſpeak of him without tears; you cannot think of him without ſighing; and it may be if I ſhould loſe my life, I ſhould not give you a minute of unquietneſs. Ah cruel creature I cryed <hi>Leonida,</hi> muſt I acknowledg my weakneſs unto you? Yes, inſenſible as you are, ſaid ſhe unto him, I will reſolve to do it, to the end I may cure your minde, or have ſo juſt an occaſion to complain of you, as abſolutely to ceaſe from loving you. It is true, ſaid ſhe unto him, that I have wept for <hi>Octavio;</hi> but it is true too, that ſpite of the grief, which your capricious humor hath poſſeſſed me with, I can aſſure you, not onely that I ſhould dye with affliction, if your death ſhould happen, but that I cannot call that a life which I have led ſince thus unjuſt paſſion hath troubled my reſt in troubling yours. <hi>In fine, Alphonſo,</hi> I have ſhed as many tears for the fear alone of loſing your good-will, though you were faulty towards me, as ever I ſhed for <hi>Octavio,</hi> who dyed for my ſake; ſo that if I am unjuſt, it is onely to him, and no way to you. It is true, that he hath rendred me all the teſtimonies of affection that I could attend from him; but it is true alſo, that I have not done the ſame; I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned him to marry <hi>Livio,</hi> and I have been capable of a ſecond love, which without doubt muſt be ſtronger then the other was, becauſe it hath been able to comfort me for the loſs I had ſuſtained: For you, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> it is not ſo; you have no occaſion to complain of me, I have done for you all that reaſonably I could do; and when I gave you a mark of my deſire to pleaſe you, it is come to paſs that out of an unheard of inhumanity, you have made uſe of the ſame Arms, which I gave you, to combat me; my ingenuity hath been th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In concluſion, <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, with a countenance wherein appeared more grief then choller, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon the choyce of two things, either to quit your error, or never to ſee me more. For, continued ſhe, I can no longer endure to ſee you in the diſpoſition you are in; but know, unjuſt and cruel as you are, that if you chuſe the laſt, you will peradventure be conſtrained to have, whether you will or no, ere it be long, more affection for the aſhes of <hi>Leonida,</hi> then you have had for her her-ſelf.</p>

                     <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> touched with ſo obliging a diſcourſe, and not able to reſolve to ſee <hi>Leonida</hi> no more, caſt himſelf at her feet, and having not the power, eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhould never have done if I ſhould repeat all <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s queſtions, and all <hi>Leonida</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; it ſhall ſuffice me then to ſay, that after an hundred odd precautions, to aſſure himſelf of the love of <hi>Leonida</hi> againſt <hi>Octavio</hi>'s phantoſm, whereunto this amiable creature out of her goodneſs anſwered ſeriouſly, he returned to Reaſon, and certain days after craved pardon of her for his error, and abſolutely promiſed her never to fall into it again. I believe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he was not ſo ſoon rid of it, and though he hath not ſpoken to <hi>Leonida</hi> ſince of it, becauſe it was one of their conditions, yet he hath not for all that left off having many times very odd thoughts. This diſpute and this peace were ſo ſecret amongſt us, that I was ſhe alone who was acquainted with it; and that was it which perſwaded <hi>Horatio</hi> and the reſt, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s melancholy proceeded from the jealouſie he was in of the affection which <hi>Aly</hi> ſeemed to carry to <hi>Leonida;</hi> but indeed it was that which I have declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis ſeeing that <hi>Sophronia</hi> held her peace, and that <hi>Leonida</hi> was going to ſpeak, as if ſhe would have excuſed <hi>Alphonſo:</hi> It muſt be acknowledged, ſaid he, that there is a marvelous diverſity amongſt men; and that which makes me moſt to wonder, is to ſee by example, that <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who in all other encounters hath a great deal of wit and diſcretion, and would in indifferent matters without doubt think the ſame things that I do, ſhould fall into in imagination ſo far diſtant from all good ſence. I think, anſwered <hi>Leonida</hi> ſmiling, that in matter of love, it may be ſaid that you are both of you an object of admiration and wonder the one to the other, but with this glorious difference for <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical jealouſie was not derived but from an exceſs of paſſion; and that your inconſtancy proceeds not but from a defect of love.</p>
                  <p>If the very exceſs of Reaſon, replyed the Marquis, comes near to, folly, I believe that this exceſs of love is not far from it: and if it be true, that by the effects one may judg of the cauſe, acknowledg, fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> that this inconſtancy, which you call defect of love in me, gave you not ſo much unquietneſs, when I abandoned you for another, as this exceſs of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath been the cauſe of to you; and confeſs withall at leaſt, that it were better to be loved of a man of my humor, then of that of <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> It would be more advantageous, replyed <hi>Leonida</hi> very roundly, becauſe as long as one ſhould not be loved but by an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant man as you are, one ſhould not be expoſed to the hazard of too much engaging ones ſelf in this affection. And then again, continued ſhe, there is this difference betwix: you too, that I have cured <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of his error, and that nothing can cure you of yours. You believe it to be juſt, and you finde it pleaſant, judg then whether your diſeaſe be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable?</p>
                  <p>For my part, ſaid <hi>Hipolita,</hi> (who according to her humor always took jealouſies part) I cannot condemn <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> nor ſhould I be ſorry that a man would render me this proof of affection. You ſpeak in this ſort, ſaid <hi>Doria</hi> interrupting her, rather out of temperature, then reaſon; but whatſoever you can ſay, I do not think that <hi>Horatio</hi> will become jealous out of complacency, and will open Tombs to finde a Rival there. It would be eaſier for me queſtionleſs to enter into them never to come out again, anſwered <hi>Horatio,</hi> then to give this unjuſt mark of love, to the perſon I affect. I believe what you ſay, replyed <hi>Hipolita,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likely enough, that a man, who could ſee an hundred Lovers at the feet of his Miſtreſs without being diſquieted at it, would be never a whit moved to know that ſhe ſhould grieve for a dead man.</p>
                  <p>As for me, added the Marquis ſmiling, if by an inverſion of all the ages it might come to paſs, that a perſon whom I ſhould love had been beloved of all the Heroes of antiquity; that they had all dyed for her, and that the aſhes of the <hi>Ceſars</hi> and the <hi>Alexanders</hi> had been the object of her tears, and of her love, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be leſs jealous thereof then of the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the living; and there is not a man, how miſ-ſhapen ſoever he could be, that would not more diſquiet me to ſee him on his knees before my Miſtreſs, then <hi>Alexander</hi> would in the ſtate wherein he is, ſhould he raign in her heart, as he raigned over all the Earth.</p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60144:208"/>
                  <p>I confeſs, ſaid <hi>Sophronia</hi> laughing, as well as the reſt of the Aſſembly, that in this occaſion I am of the Marquis his ſide, for <hi>I</hi> cannot but follow Reaſon whereſoever <hi>I</hi> meet with it. <hi>I</hi> perceive, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> then, that all the world abandons me, and that <hi>I</hi> have need of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>'s aſſiſtance for the vanquiſhing of ſo many Enemies. <hi>I</hi> am generous enough, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marquis, to go and fetch him my ſelf; and ſaying ſo, he went and called <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who was almoſt aſhamed to come unto the Company again, making no queſtion but that they had condemned his jealous humor. And whereas <hi>Leonida</hi> perceived it, Fear not, ſaid ſhe unto him, as long as <hi>I</hi> am on your ſide, you will have no Enemies which you may not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and doubt not that the remembrance of an error, which <hi>I</hi> have pardoned, can make me angry with you. <hi>I</hi> believe you to be too juſt, replyed he, for me to ſuſpect you of any ſuch thing, onely <hi>I</hi> fear that you will be accuſed for uſing too much goodneſs towards me, and that by this means <hi>I</hi> ſhould be the cauſe of condemning a vertue in you, which makes one to be commended in all the world beſides.</p>
                  <p>If we engage our ſelves in making of complements, ſaid <hi>Sophronia</hi> interrupting him, the Marquis will not be able to pay me that to day which he ows me, and ſo we ſhould ſpend the time leſs pleaſingly then otherwiſe we might do if we gave him audience, for I aſſure my ſelf that he cannot tell us any thing but what will delight us. I do not know, anſwered the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, whether this diſcourſe be advantageous to me or no, howſoever, ſince I have promiſed to relate that unto you which befell me here in <hi>Constantinople, I</hi> will not break my word. And then again, continued he, to ſpeak ſincerely unto you, <hi>I</hi> ſhall have a ſhare in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which <hi>I</hi> ſhall give you; it being moſt cerain, that I am of a humor to receive more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by recounting the adventures which have happened unto me, be they never ſo happy, then I had at ſuch time as they arived unto me. <hi>In fine,</hi> continued he, I comfort my ſelf for miſhaps in telling them to others, and I augment my good fortune in publiſhing it.</p>
                  <p>Seeing it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> haſte you to ſatisfie <hi>Sophronia,</hi> in ſatisfying your ſelf, and be not of the number of thoſe, who make one hope ſo long for an indifferent pleaſure, as one is not obliged to them for it. All the Company having added their intreaties to <hi>Leonida</hi>'s diſcourſe, the Marquis acquitted himſelf of his promiſe in this ſort.</p>

                  <head>The Hiſtory of the too good Slave.</head>
                  <p>NEver was any ſo happy in ſervitude as I, and never did happineſs produce an effect like unto that which I am going to recount unto you. You remember without doubt, that when we arrived all at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and landed at the Port, there was a man, who rightly imagining by the chains we had on us, that we were deſtined to be ſold, and finding ſomething in my perſon that pleaſed him, bought me for the price that was demanded of him. This man, who was my firſt Maſter, carried me home to his houſe: and whereas he was one of the mightieſt men in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I was comforted in my misfortune to ſee, that at leaſtwiſe if I were a Slave, it ſhould be in a place where I ſhould have companions. I was no ſooner come thither, but to teſtifie that he had ſome inclination for me, he cauſed the chains that I had on me to be taken off, to give me lighter; ſo that deſiring to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging for this favor, and render my ſlavery alſo more eaſie, by making myſelf be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of thoſe, who might ill-intreat me, I became in two hours the beſt Slave that was in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I did not only that which was ordained me, but I alſo helped others to do that which had been commanded them. And whereas it is the cuſtom of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as I learned afterwards, carefully to obſerve all their new Slaves at their firſt coming, my Maſter was a witneſs of all the ſervices which I rendred him, and ſeemed to be ſo ſatisfied with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that all the other Slaves began already to hate me.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day being paſt over in this ſort, the next morning my Maſter would needs have two wives that he had to ſee me; he commanded then that I ſhould go to their lodging, and whereas I knew not whither they led me, I was ſo ſurprized with their beauty, as I could not forbear teſtifying a great deal of joy by my carriage at it. I found them ſo much the fairer, becauſe for four and twenty hours before I had ſeen none but black Slaves; I ſaluted them then very civilly, and beheld them at leaſtwiſe with as much attention, as they had in conſidering me: and without regarding whether my Maſter took it well or no, and without remembring that I was a Slave, I thought of nothing but of making ſhew with low obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances, as often as I could judg by their behavior that they ſpoke of me, that I was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful for them, as I was ſerviceable and diligent for their husband. But at length he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to withdraw, which preſently I did; true indeed it is, that it was not without turning back my look to the place where I left two fair women, and truly I felt ſome pain in ſeparating my ſelf from them.</p>
                  <p>I was no ſooner gone down, and had done ſomething which had been enjoyned me, but I went with all ſpeed into a back Court, upon which the windows of theſe womens chamber opened, out of a hope that I might peradventure ſee them again: But by ill fortune my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was there as well as they; ſo as having obſerved that I had nothing to do there, I cannot tell you whether he ſuſpected the truth or no, howſoever without having any cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me, he commanded me to be conducted the next morning to the Market where Slaves are ſold, and that there they ſhould rid themſelves of me at any price whatſoever. I muſt confeſs to you that this change ſurprized me; nevertheleſs whereas I comfort my ſelf eaſily, as you know, in all things, I reſolved for patience.</p>
                  <p>He that next bought me was a Merchant of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> whom I ſerved as exactly as the other: And whereas in theſe kind of houſes the reſtraint is not ſo great, as in thoſe of perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, I had ſome content to ſee that in ſerving my Miſter, I ſhould at leaſtwiſe have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to meet ſometimes with a wife that he had, and two <hi>Greek</hi> Slaves that ſerved her, and that certainly did not ſhame their Nation. I got their good-will the very firſt day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to tell you how I did it. If they ſaw that I had a purpoſe to go forth, they went in all haſte to open me the door; if I carried any thing, they preſently offered to help me; in concluſion I won their inclination in ſuch ſort, as my Maſter hated me for it. For when he was withdrawn to his chamber, his Wife and the Slaves praiſed me ſo much, as out of jealouſie and covetouſneſs he reſolved to be rid of me. He feared leſt his wife would love me too well, and that his Slaves would agree together with me to rob him.</p>
                  <p>In this thought, he conducted me himſelf to the Market; but whereas he was known to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60144:209"/> be one of the moſt avaricious men in the world, it was not very eaſie for him to get me an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Maſter: For although he aſſured them which cheapened me, that I was the moſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, the moſt ſerviceable, and moſt diligent Slave that ever he had had, yet no body would beleeve him; becauſe out of the intention he had to rid himſelf ſpeedily of me he ſet me at too cheap a rate. Certainly, ſaid they who were willing to buy me, this Slave muſt have ſome great defect, which we know not of, ſeeing the moſt avaricious man that is reſolves to part with him at ſo low a price. He is young, he is not unhandſom, he ſeems not to be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick; ſo that without doubt he hath taken him in ſome theft, or elſe he would never be ſo forward to ſell him.</p>
                  <p>In this opinion no body bought me the firſt day, nor on the ſecond neither. Howbeit my Maſter, having obſerved that his Wife and Slaves were very glad to ſee me brought home again, he purpoſed to part with me for leſs then he had intended, hoping thereby to be the ſooner rid of me. But he conſidered not, that out of the opinion the world had of him, the leſs he ſhould ask for me, the more he would be troubled to ſell me. And verily there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any pleaſanter thing, then the choller of this covetous wretch when as he could not reſolve to loſe his money, and was conſtrained in the evening to carry back to his houſe a man, whom he beheld as his Rival, and yet had no cauſe to complain of him. For whereas I was not ignorant, that Slaves in this Country are at their Maſters mercy, the fear of ſome croſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture made me very prudent, ſo that as long as my Maſter could ſee me I did not anſwer the complacencies of his Slaves. Wherefore not being able either to ſell me, to complain of me, or to reſolve to give me my liberty, becauſe he would not loſe but a part of the money he had given for me, he was in an unquietneſs which I am not able to repreſent unto you.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt on the third day a <hi>Boluchbaſſi,</hi> who had cheapened me when firſt he would have ſold me, and who imagined that I could have no other defect then of being unfaithful, tempted by the good peniworth, reſolved to take me into his ſervice. And to ſecure himſelf from the vice whereof he ſuſpected me, he purpoſed to employ me in his Garden, untill ſuch time as he had made tryal of my fidelity. I was then conducted home to his houſe, where I no ſooner was, but having g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ven me wherewith to labor the ground I found my ſelf at firſt ſomewhat troubled. Nevertheleſs whereas I had whil'ſt I was in the Wars helped many times out of a bravery to caſt up Trenches, and raiſe Forts, I became in two hours ſo good a Gardiner, as I levelled an Alley better then all they of <hi>Constantinople</hi> could have done.</p>
                  <p>My addreſs having pleaſed my Maſter, he brought three Wives that he had, followed by all their Slaves, to ſee my work, which they admired; and paſſing from the commendation of my work to that of my perſon, they ſaid too much for themſelves, if they took any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſeeing me. Nevertheleſs it was not that alone which made me change my dwelling, but it was for that, my Maſter being gone a little way off, and that I ſaw all theſe women walking ſtill about me, without making ſhew of heeding them, and as if it had been to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my labor the leſs irkſom, I ſet my ſelf to ſing indifferent loud. My voyce pleaſed them in ſuch ſort, as I thought they would never have left me; and when I perceived the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they received by it, I did nothing but ſing, out of a hope that at leaſtwiſe I ſhould not always be alone in this Garden. But for fear my Maſter ſhould think that it was only for his Wives, or for their Slaves that I ſung, I never gave over; ſo that if I had continued in that manner any long time, I ſhould, to ſpeak poetically, have dyed like a Swan. My invention failed not in the expected ſucceſs, as alſo it failed not in making me to be turned away. For I no ſooner began to work, but I began to ſing; and preſently not only all the Slaves, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the Officers of the houſe, but even my Maſters wives, who were wont to fear the Sun, and to walk but very ſeldom, came in all haſte to hear me: A Slave could not be ſent any whither, but ſhe would ſtill make it her way to go out at one of the Garden doors; and how preſſing ſoever the matter was about which ſhe was ſent, ſhe would hide her ſelf behind ſome hedg to hear me; and in this ſort, though I wrought very diligently, yet left I not incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating my Maſter, becauſe I kept all his ſervants from doing their duties. This man had ſo much goodneſs, as he could not eaſily reſolve to forbid me from ſinging; imagining that I had no other deſign then to drive away melancholy in doing my work. Howbeit, ſeeing at length that he could not be ſerved by his people, and that even his Wives could not be kept
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60144:209"/> in the houſe, he abſolutely forbad me from it, and I obeyed him without reſiſtance. But this which he thought to do for his quiet, and to retain me in his ſervice, was that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him the more, and made me to be turned away. For no ſooner did his Wives and his Slaves know of the prohibition he had made me, but there was a ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the houſe. Both the one and the others murmured alike; <hi>Who ever ſaw ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>as to forbid a man, loaden With irons, and that does his duty ſo well, from ſinging? this tyranny is ſo exceſſive, as is not to be endured, and certainly the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of. In fine,</hi> this murmuring and this revolt went ſo far, that this man to be at reſt reſolved to ſell me away, which he did the next day with a great deal of regret, becauſe I pleaſed him extreamly.</p>
                  <p>It was my deſtiny to be bought by an <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſician; for whereas he had asked to what employment I had been put in my Maſters houſe, and had been anſwered that I was an excellent Gardiner, he imagined that I knew ſome Simples, and conſequently might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, by reaſon the Phyſick of this Country conſiſts much therein. In effect, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he had never been ſerved more diligently; and albeit I was very ignorant in all the things that he made me do, yet my addreſs and confidence ſupplyed that defect. This Phyſician had two daughters, who having loſt their mother lived alone with him; ſo that whil'ſt he was in his viſits, I had ſometimes the pleaſure to ſee them. For whereas the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> are very curions of their beauty, the deſire they had to gain me, to the end I might give them certain waters for the face, which their father would not let them have, made them uſe me very civilly; and for fear I ſhould be put away, they taught me all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I had to do the beſt they could.</p>
                  <p>I had no ſooner made an end of whatſoever the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſician had commanded me to do at his going forth, but I went to entertain his daughters at a lattice window that was very low, and teach them new means to become fair, which I ſaid I had learnt in <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo that when my Maſter came home, he never found me amongſt his eſſences: yet he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me, becauſe whatſoever he had ordained me to do, was always performed. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined then, that ſince I was ſo diligent, he was to give me more employment, for fear leſt out of idleneſs I ſhould have too much converſation with his daughters; but whereas they were dextrous, they perceived his deſign, ſo as finding that to buſie me, beſides neceſſary things he had left me great ſtore of Grite roots to prepare for the Baths, which are ſo frequent in this Country, they made me give them part of them; ſo that all three working, the buſineſs was quickly diſpatched, and we had time enough beſides for converſation: In ſo much that my Maſter coming home in the evening, with an opinion that he ſhould find me very buſie, and a belief that he had met with an excellent expedient to keep me from entertaining his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he was ſtrangely ſurprized to ſee me labor no more then I was wont to do. Nevertheleſs he could not reſolve to quarrel with me, having never been ſo well ſerved as by me.</p>
                  <p>In this unquietneſs he took a new reſolution, which was to enjoyn me to wait upon him in the ſtreets, and to leave him in my place who was uſually to accompany him. But theſe maie's were no leſs witty in this occaſion then the other; they won this Slave with money, and dealt in ſuch ſort, as when we came home, there was nothing done of all that had been ordained him; and this out of the hope that their father would alter his mind, and not carry me any more abroad with him. This ſlight notwithſtanding wrought that which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not; for the Phyſician, ſeeing that when he carried me abroad with him, none of his work was done; and that when I ſtayed at home, his daughters always ſent for me, reſolved to ſell me. And truly I was not ſorry for it, in regard I had but little knowledg in the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of Drugs; and in my ignorance, I could not find out a better invention, then when as my Maſter named one to me, which I knew not, to chuſe another, which had no ill quality; to the end that at leaſtwiſe if I did no good, I would do no harm.</p>
                  <p>In going from thence, I was bought by two <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who having demanded of me in that corrupted <hi>Italian,</hi> which every one underſtands at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the commodity of commerce, whether I could carry their Arms, and keep them bright? When as I anſwered them, that I would do it as well as I could, they agreed of the price, and carried me home with them. And whereas I was better ſeen in the uſe of a Scymitar, then in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Simples, the manner wherewith I handled theirs when they came to their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60144:210"/> houſe pleaſed them in ſuch ſort, as I was their well beloved Slave. I looked upon the blade of it like a man that was not ignorant thereof; I knew of what temper it was, and by my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior they judged, that War without doubt had been my Trade.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt underſtand, that theſe two <hi>Janizaries</hi> had each of them a fair Slave; and that as long as I was with them, though they were both of one company, yet were they of a different Squadron, ſo that they were not both upon the Guard at one and the ſame day; by which means one of them always remained at home, as it were the Guardian of the two Slaves. In the mean time I acquitted my ſelf admirably of the employment had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on me; and never had their Arms been ſo well kept, as ſince the time that I had been in their ſervice. But if they were contented with me, no leſs were the two Slaves, though I contributed nothing thereunto: For by reaſon of that which I told you in the beginning, I was never leſs a Love, then in all theſe ſeveral encounters, albeit I was never ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. Theſe fair Slaves did not for all that teſtifie unto me both at once the good-will they bore me; and out of a particular addreſs they thoſe the day wherein the <hi>Janizary</hi> that was their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hereas he was contented with my ſervice, and ſaw that I contributed nothing thereunto, he did not advertiſe him of it. The ſame reaſon which this Soldier had, the other had alſo; and by this means I was for ſome time equally beloved of both the two <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and of the two Slaves. It hapned at length, that by order of War theſe two <hi>Janizaries</hi> were put into one and the ſame Squadron, and thereby would have been conſtrained to leave me alone with their Slaves, being obliged to go upon the Guard the ſame day, had they not bethought themſelves of telling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which they knew concerning the good-will theſe Wenches bore me. Wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how they were equally intereſſed in the buſineſs, they diſputed a good while betwixt themſelves what they were to do. At laſt, though they loved me exceedingly, they ſold me that very day, not being able to reſolve to leave me alone with their Slaves.</p>
                  <p>The fantaſticalneſs of my fortune ſo wrought, that a Muſician of this Country, who taught to play on the only Inſtrument which they have at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and that holds ſomewhat of the form of the Lutes of <hi>Italy,</hi> took me into his ſervice, and carried me home with him. The next day after my coming thither, when he was gone abroad, I took one of thoſe <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lutes (for he had many of them,) and whereas this Inſtrument hath but one ſtring, I thought, that if I could put more to it, this Harmony it may be would pleaſe my Maſter, and might obtain my liberty. I took one of thoſe Lutes then ſecretly, and going to one of thoſe that makes them, who dwelt hard by this Muſicians houſe, and whom I had by chance taken notice of as I came thither, I directed him how I would have it done. At length I made him fit this Lute for ſeven ranks of ſtrings; and whereas I had ſtill one of thoſe enamelled Gold rings left, which are worn rather out of gallantry, then for their value, I gave it him for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his pains. Being returned home, I put ſtrings to this Lute, and beginning to touch it, I drew to me with my harmony my Maſters wife, two ſiſters that he had, and three Slaves. So that when he returned, he found me in the midſt of all theſe women, who harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me with a great deal of delight and attention. At firſt he was angry, both with them, and with me; but coming to hear me himſelf, he pardoned them their curioſity, and hoping to gain good ſtore of money by my means, he careſſed me extraordinarily. He undertook not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to maintain againſt me, that in ſomething their Lutes were more perfect then ours; becauſe, ſaid he, having but one ſtring they can never be out of tune. This pleaſant reaſon being nothing hard to be deſtroyed, I made him eaſily comprehend, that my Muſick was better then his; and the very next day he carried me to all the houſes, whither he uſed to go; where they had no ſooner heard me, but they would hear him no more. This man being as proud as he was covetous, although I might have got him a great deal of money, yet could he not reſolve to carry me any more along with him; ſo that purpoſing to learn to play as I did, he left me at home; and mornings and evenings only I took him out Leſſons. But I was not long both his Maſter and his Slave; for when as he was no leſs jealous then proud, knowing that his Wife, his Siſters, and his Slaves, did nothing but harken to me, out of a capriciouſneſs worthy of him, he reſolved to ſell me.

                  <p>This laſt paſſion being the ſtronger, he ſought to rid himſelf me; and had ſo much malice, that to keep me from teaching ſome other that which he would not learn of me himſelf, he went to ſell me at the Port, where I was preſently bought by the Captain of a Galley, who was upon going forth to ſcour the Seas. I confeſs that this adventure vexed me; for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that I left you all at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> without knowing whither I went, I was out of quiet above an hour at leaſt; howbeit I hoped to meet with ſome good fortune which I did not foreſee; and in this thought I ſerved my new Maſter with as much care as I could, yet was I not long with him, for whereas he was avaricious, and had no need but of one Slave, that could row, he was perſwaded that he might ſell me for ſo much, as he might therewith get two in ſtead of one; ſo that all the endevor which I had uſed for two days ſpace, to ſhew him the greateſt addreſs I could poſſibly expreſs, ſerved not but to make me be ſold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſooner, and to give me a Maſter of an higher condition then thoſe laſt I had had; for whereas the price which he asked for me was great enough, I was no longer cheapned but by perſons of quality. The <hi>Cadileſquer</hi> then of <hi>Natolia</hi> became my Maſter, and to his houſe I was carried; but from him I parted a little after for the like reaſons; then was I entertained by the <hi>Muphti;</hi> and the next day after I paſt into the ſervice of the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> where they that ſought for me by the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> command found me. Indeed it is true, that I ſhould not have been long there, for <hi>I</hi> was to have been ſold away again the very ſame day.</p>
                  <p>In concluſion, after I had had for my Maſter a great man of the Port, a Merchant of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſician, two <hi>Janizaries,</hi> a Player upon the Lute, an <hi>African</hi> Captain of a Galley, the <hi>Cadileſquer</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> the <hi>Muphti,</hi> and the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> after, I ſay, I had equally ſatisfied them all, Fortune at laſt reſtored me to liberty. And truly I was not a little obliged to her for ſo far complying with my humor, as not to let me wear the ſame chains long; it being moſt certain that I ſhould have been dead with grief, if ſhe had uſed the matter otherwiſe. For is it credible, contined the Marquis, that a man, who could not live long under the Empire of one onely Miſtreſs, whoſe dominion is incomparably more gentle then a Merchant of <hi>Tripoli's,</hi> could have lived long under that of an imperious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? And to ſay all in a word, it is eaſie to be imagined, that if I had ſtill worn but one chain, it would have ſeemed very heavy to me, ſeeing even bracelets of hair would incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date me if I ſhould wear them long. Change is the charm of all pleaſures, and the eaſe of all ſorrows. There is not an evil, how little ſoever it be, that would not become inſupportable to me, if I ſhould always endure it after the ſame manner; nor is there any which I ſhould not bear with patience, if it were not always the ſame. For <hi>in fine,</hi> whether it be for the pains of the body, or for the pains of the minde, one cannot paſs from one evil to another, without ſome moments of reſt. Change hath this marvellous in it, that in pain it ſelf, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that which we feel, it diverts, it eaſes, and fortifies us. And of what humor ſoever we be, we think not ſo much of the evil that is arrived to us, but that we have ſome joy for that which hath left us.</p>
                  <p>You are too eloquent on this ſubject, ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> interrupting the Marquis, and if I might be credited herein, both for the intereſt of publique ſociety, and good manners, you ſhould be prohibited from ever ſpeaking in the behalf of inconſtancy: For whereas you have a great of wit; whereas alſo you ſpeak as a man intereſſed; and as a man that maintains his own cauſe, you may at length p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If I had eſtabliſhed my doctrine well, anſwered he, you ſhould be conſtrained to acknowledg, that it is not contrary either to common ſociety, or the publique good. For never hath any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant man precipitated himſelf; never hath any inconſtant man killed his Rivals, nor ill-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treared his Miſtreſs; and fire, ſword, and poyſon, are things of no uſe in nature to him; but he leaves them to the diſpoſing of all thoſe obſtinate Lovers, who always render themſelves unhappy, in following this conſtancy, which you term the Queen of all Vertues. We are not to judg always of things, replyed <hi>Doria,</hi> by the event; and then in this occaſion, it is not Conſtancy that makes Lovers unhappy, but Fortune, that delights to perſecute Vertue; and in this ſort, even unhappineſs ſerves for the glory of which are conſtant.</p>

If <hi>Iſabella</hi> had not been conſtant, ſhe ſhould not be in the old <hi>Serraglio;</hi> and if all you that are here had not followed this goodly vertue, you had not ſighed ſo much as you have done, and peradventure you ſhould not be at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> If that be a puniſhment of our fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, replyed <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> you muſt at leaſt-wiſe acknowledg, that that which you call our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, is your recompence, ſeeing you are here as well as we. It eaſily appears, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marquis, that I am not unhappy but for your ſakes; for do not you ſee how Fortune hath made be beloved of all my Maſters, of all their Wives, and of all their Slaves? and to work a prodigy in favor of me, ſhe hath cauſed them all to turn me away without hating me. I muſt confeſs, ſaid <hi>Hipolita,</hi> that this adventure is altogether extraordinary, and that it is not a little ſtrange to imagine, that that which ſhould have made you uſe but one chain, hath made you change it ſo often. You know me but ill, fair <hi>Hipolita,</hi> anſwered the Marquis, when you ſpeak to me thus; for I can always break my chains, but never wear them out.</p>
                  <p>After this, all this fair Troop ran over the Marquis his adventures again, and not able to forbear laughing at their imagining him a Slave to two <hi>Janizaries,</hi> a Gardiner, a Phyſician, and a Merchant, they figured him ſuch to themſelves as he had been in all thoſe divers employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he had had. And he himſelf repreſented them unto them in ſo diverting a maner, as manger their ancient miſeries, and thoſe wherein they ſtill were, they paſſed away all that day without annoy, without care, and without melancholy.</p>

               <p>WHil'ſt this agreeable Company endeavored to forget their preſent misfortunes, by remembring thoſe which they had avoyded; <hi>Iſabella</hi> was in an extraordinary melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, although ſhe was as yet but in the apprehenſion of an evil that was to arrive unto her. Every time that ſhe heard her chamber door open, ſhe always believed that <hi>Soliman</hi> was come to diſcover his un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There were yet ſome times wherein ſhe condemned her own thoughts; and wherein <hi>Emilia</hi>'s ſpeeches gave her ſome conſolation. Theſe good intervals for all that laſted not long; and how conſtant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Iſabella</hi> was, ſhe was always nearer to deſpair then to tranquillity. On the other ſide, <hi>Soliman</hi> was in no leſs pain; his love, his vertue, and his irreſolution upon that which he was to do, put his Soul into ſo great a diſorder, as he then merited to be as much lamented, as blamed.</p>
               <p>But at length, whereas it is hard to conſent to the rendring of ones ſelf unhappy for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers felicity, and to renounce things out of generoſity which one ardently affects, <hi>Soliman's</hi> Reaſon being combated by his own deſires, by a violent paſſion, and by the Artifices of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elana,</hi> it found it ſelf in the end ſo weak, as he abſolutely reſolved to ſpeak to <hi>Iſabella</hi> of his paſſion. I know very well, ſaid he to himſelf, that this is to betray the friendſhip which I have promiſed to <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> but I know withall, that it would be the betraying of my ſelf, and the cauſe of my death, if I ſhould bereave my ſelf of the hope which I have of prevailing one day with <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this reſolution, <hi>Soliman</hi> went to the Princeſſes chamber on a time when as the <hi>Sultana Aſteria</hi> was come from her, and that none but <hi>Emilia</hi> was with her. When as firſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſaw him, ſhe changed colour; and <hi>Soliman</hi> on his part, who very much reſpected her, and that ſtill loved <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> thought to alter his reſolution; and in this ſort, fear troubling <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and reſpect ſilencing <hi>Soliman,</hi> they were a while unable to ſpeak to one another. The <hi>Sultan</hi> was he at laſt that began the Converſation, in craving pardon of <hi>Iſabella</hi> for the conſtraint wherein ſhe lived. My Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, ſince it concerns the quiet of thy <hi>State,</hi> I dare not murmur at it; and though the privation of my friends be a diſpleaſure ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enough, I do endure it without complaining of thy Highneſs; I do accuſe Fortune, and do juſtifie <hi>Soliman,</hi> who without doubt will never be but equitable. Would to Heaven, ſaid he unto her, I might be ſure that you would ſpeak thus always! My Lord, replyed ſhe, this is a thing which will abſolutely depend on thy Highneſs; it being moſt certain that I ſhall ever be reaſonable, and not be ſo inconſiderate as to think ought to the diſadvantage of thy Majeſty, if I be not conſtrained thereunto by thy ſelf. I could have wiſhed, replyed <hi>Soliman,</hi> that without exception you had promiſed me never to think amiſs of me; for it may be you will learn from mine own mouth that I am faulty.</p>

I know full well, ſaid he unto her, that I am going to deſtroy my ſelf; that in acquainting you with my thoughts, I am going to make you hate me; but I would ſain have you tell me, added he, before I confeſs my crime unto you, whether an error, which is not voluntary, merits as much chaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60144:212"/> would judg of others by your ſelf, and that you would condemn in another, that which is not found in you. But, amiable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> continued he, you are unjuſt to deal ſo; ſeeing it is impoſſible that ever your Soul ſhould be put to ſo difficult a tryal, as that is which I have encountred. You have but weak enemies to ſight with, and a great deal of vertue to reſiſt them; your Reaſon, in what a occaſion ſoever you find your ſelf, is always on your ſide; but, amiable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in this wherein I am, my Reaſon is my crueleſt enemy. It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath not oppoſed all my thoughts as much as ſhe could; and this is it which puts me out of all hope of vanquiſhing, having no longer arms to defend me. For my Reaſon hath been ſo abſolutely ſurmounted, as it is rather by her then by my paſſion, that I am reſolved to diſcover my hurt unto her which hath cauſed it. Let thy Highneſs take heed, ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> to him then, that in diſcovering it thou make it not the worſe; and that that which thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt would be a remedy for thy grief, be not a means to increaſe it. That which you ſay, anſwered <hi>Soliman,</hi> may eaſily fall out; but, continued he, what would you have a Prince do, who is no longer Maſter, either of his heart, of his ſoul, or of his will; who ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> knowing not what to anſwer to a diſcourſe which ſhe underſtood but too well for her reſt, fetched a great ſigh in lifting up her eyes to Heaven, as it were craving ſuccor from thence; which <hi>Soliman</hi> having; ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But after I have perſwaded you, continued he, without giving her leaſure to anſwer him, that <hi>Soliman</hi> adores you, ſuffer not that, which hath accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be beneficial to all Lovers, to be prejudicial to me. For, added he, I ſee very well, that the more I ſhall perſwade you that I love you, the more you will hold your ſelf injured by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But to take away at leaſtwiſe the means from you of reproaching me with my crime, I will acknowledg, divine <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that I know being your Protector, I ought not to be your Lover; that loving <hi>Ibrahim</hi> as I do, I ought not to be his Rival; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting you as I ought, I ſhould not uſe any diſcourſe to you that offends you; that loving glory, I ought not to endure an affection which may blemiſh it; but I know, more then all this, that love never ſhews it ſelf, either greater, or more perfect, then when it deſtroys friendſhip, forces Reaſon, and without conſidering either honor or glory, carries us to dye, or to make our ſelves be beloved of the perſon whom we adore. This, incomparable <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> is the eſtate whereunto you have reduced my Soul; but if notwithſtanding I may be permitted to employ Reaſon for the obliging of you to pity, remember that you would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in cauſing the death of a Prince, who heretofore hath ſaved <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life; and that cruelty can never paſs for a vertue. Be then in ſome ſort indulgent to my paſſion, and at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bemoan the hurt which you have done me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soliman</hi> holding his peace, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> being ſomewhat come to her ſelf again; Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſaid ſhe unto him, that this which I hear is true? and that the greateſt Prince of the Earth ſhould be the weakeſt amongſt men? No, I cannot think it; and the diſcourſe which thy Highneſs hath uſed to me, is doubtleſs a deſign to prove my conſtancy and reſolution. But, my Lord, to oblige thee no longer to continue ſo dangerous a fiction, know, that if it were true that thy Highneſs had for me the violenteſt affection that ever was heard ſpoken of, it ſhould not ſerve but to haſten my death; it being moſt certain, that the moſt terrible and horribleſt torments that can be imagined ſhould never carry me to be wanting, either to that which I owe to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to my ſelf, or to thy Highneſs. No, my Lord, I ſhould never be a Complice of great <hi>Soliman</hi>'s fault; and for his own intereſt I ought always oppoſe my ſelf againſt him. But, continued ſhe, it is in ſome ſort an injury to thy Majeſty to anſwer ſo preciſely to a diſcourſe, whoſe foundation is not tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Would to Heaven, replyed <hi>Soliman,</hi> both for your content and mine, that it were ſo! But, amiable <hi>Iſabella,</hi> it is but too true what I ſay; and if there be any feigning in my diſcourſe, it is that I have not ſaid all that I feel. I confeſs, that I am faulty towards Heaven; that I am ſo towards <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> that I betray the friendſhip which I have promiſed him; that I forget the care of my glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and that I betray my ſelf; but in concluſion, being faulty towards all the world, I am
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60144:212"/> innocent towards you; ſince it is certain, that a violent love, to ſpeak reaſonably, can never offend the perſon that hath begotten it. And how conſtant ſoever you be for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> how rigorous foever you be for me, you cannot without injuſtice but take pity of the deplorable eſtate wherein I am. I do not demand of you your love as yet, but ſome compaſſion; and at leaſt bemoan me, if you cannot love me.</p>
               <p>Great Princes, replyed <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ought to be ſenſible of pity, but they never ought to put themſelves into a condition of being the object of it to others: Neither will I be drawn to beleeve that <hi>Soliman</hi> hath a thought ſo unworthy of himſelf. For, my Lord, how can I think that thy Highneſs will ſtab a Poignard into the heart of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> after thou haſt ſaved his life? if it ſhould be ſo, it had better, both for him, for me, and for thy Highneſs, that he had been left to languiſh in his irons, or to dye of melancholy, then to ſave him for to kill him the more cruelly. Let thy Majeſty conſult well with thy ſelf, and thou wilt find without doubt, that thy heart agrees not with thy mouth; that thy words betray thy thoughts; and that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> is yet more powerful in thy Soul, then the fatal beauty of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> No, ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> interrupting her, do not juſtifie me in this ſort; ſince in the terms wherein I am, I have no other deſign, then to let you know, that I am the moſt faulty of all men, in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you, that I am the moſt amorous. Ah, my Lord, ſaid ſhe to him weeping, doth not thy Highneſs conſider, that at this very time it may be, wherein thy Highneſs uſeth ſo ſtrange a diſcourſe unto me, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> is fitghing with thine enemies, is hazarding his life for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſhedding his blood for a Prince, who makes me ſhed tears, and who without doubt will bring me to my grave, if his unjuſt love doth continue?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soliman</hi> being moved with ſo preſſing a diſcourſe, ſtood a while without anſwering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but at length his paſſion ſtill ſurmounting his vertue in this occaſion; I know, ſaid he unto her, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life ought to be dear unto me; but I know withall that mine ought to be conſiderable to me: and I am certain, that what exploits ſoever he can do in <hi>Perſia,</hi> I have done more yet in conſideration of him. I have fought for him againſt my ſelf; I have felt my ſelf in the flame without daring to complain; love and friendſhip have torn my heart; and I know no torments ſo terrible which I have not endured ſince the firſt inſtant that I ſaw you, rather then to do any thing againſt the affection which I bear him. But being come to the terms, either of dying, or ſpeaking, I choſe the laſt; and ſo much the rather, becauſe I do not think but a man, who could abandon you at <hi>Monaco,</hi> to come unto me to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> will eaſily enough reſolve to quit you, for the ſaving of a Princes life, to whom he is indebted for his own. Ah, my Lord I cryed <hi>Iſabella,</hi> if <hi>Ibrahim</hi> be faulty in this occaſion, it is againſt me, and not againſt thy Highneſs, who by this very fault art yet the more ſtraitly obliged not to commit one againſt him. For what doth not a man deſerve, who rather then he would fail in his word which he had given thee, reſolved to abandon, not only his Country, not only his Friends; but the only perſon whom he could love; who was in ſtead to him of all the world; and without whom his life had been irkſom, and death the term of his deſires? No, my Lord, continued ſhe, flatter not thy ſelf in this occaſion; think better, both of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and be moſt aſſured, that as I am certain he would dye a thouſand times rather then abandon me, ſo ſhould I do the like, rather then be unfaithful to him. And if by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, which I cannot fear ſhould happen, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſhould conſent to thy paſſion; if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould ſpeak to me of thy love, yet let thy Highneſs know, that I am not capable of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by example. I ſhould ceaſe to love <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> if he ceaſed to be generous, but I ſhould love thee never a whit the more; contrarily, I ſhould regard thee then, both as having out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me, and as having bereaved me of a vertuous Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabella</hi> was going on in her diſcourſe, and <hi>Soliman</hi> was going to interrupt her, when as the generous <hi>Aſteria</hi> entered: And whereas the <hi>Sultan</hi> had ſtill ſome reſpect for <hi>Iſabella,</hi> he would not command the <hi>Sultana</hi> to withdraw; but being unable withall in the eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Soul was to begin an indifferent Converſation, he went away, leaving <hi>Iſabella</hi> with an affliction, that may be better imagined then deſcribed. He was no ſooner departed, but <hi>Aſteria,</hi> who had obſerved a great deal of alteration in <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s and <hi>Soliman</hi>'s faces, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her with much impatience and grief, what it was that had cauſed the trouble wherein ſhe ſaw her. Alas! anſwered the Princeſs, how have my fears been too well grounded, and how true have your ſuſpicions been! and then ſhe recounted unto her what had paſt betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>It was in vain for them to ſeek for ſome remedy to their miſery; it was too great to find one for it. <hi>Emilia</hi> propounded nevertheleſs unto them, the advertiſ ng <hi>Ibrahim</hi> of the outrage was done her; but whereas he was too far off for them to hope for any ſuccor from him, this advice was but a weak conſolation to <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Howbeit ſhe deſired the <hi>Sultana Aſteria</hi> to endevor the finding out of means to convey a Letter to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> which the <hi>Sultana</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her to do; upon condition that ſhe might obtain of her generoſity, that he ſhould be contented with delivering her, without enterprizing to be revenged on <hi>Soliman;</hi> for, ſaid the <hi>Sultana</hi> to her, Were not the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> my Father, knowing him as I do, I could not chuſe but have compaſſion of the eſtate wherein I ſee him. If he were not generous, he were not to be lamented; but I am well aſſured, continued ſhe, that he puniſhes himſelf in off riding you; that the remorſe which he hath in his Soul torments him as much as his paſſion; that at the very ſame time when as he ſpeaks to you of his unjuſt paſſion, he craves pardon in his heart of the generous <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and that he repents at that very inſtant wherein he commits the fault. Alaſs, cryed <hi>Iſabella,</hi> how dangerous is this unprofitable generoſity! and how little difference is there betwixt a man that doth ill without knowing it, and another that knoweth vertue, and is not able to follow it. Repentance, continued ſhe, that begets no change in the minde of him that repents, is rather a weakneſs, then a remorſe. But, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> I deſire you to pardon me for not remembering that you are the daughter of <hi>Soliman;</hi> and I promiſe you, if <hi>Ibrahim</hi> can return before the <hi>Sultan's</hi> love hath layd me in my grave, and that he can deliver me, to obtain of him that he ſhall not think of revenge: and I am very certain, added ſhe, that what affection ſoever <hi>Ibrahim</hi> bears to me, he will be grieved to hear that which we will write to him, but will not conceive any hatred againſt <hi>Soliman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that theſe three afflicted perſons had talked a good while of this ſubject; and that <hi>Iſabella,</hi> having written to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> had given her Letter to the <hi>Sultana Aſteria,</hi> ſhe try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gifts to gain one of the Eunuchs that ſerved them, to the end he might fly out of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and carry this Letter to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with as much ſpeed as poſſibly might be: but it fell out, that after <hi>Soliman</hi> had been at the Princeſſes lodging, there had been ſuch an expreſs Order given, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Roxelana</hi> in the mean time, being advertiſed of all the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s thoughts, by that Slave whom he had made his Confident, carryed him ſtill on by the means of the ſame Slave to violent reſolutions; but whereas reſpect never quits love, but when as fury and deſpair take up the place of it, <hi>Soliman</hi> ſuffered not himſelf to be perſwaded with facility to employ menaces, where ſubmiſſions are ordinarily moſt powerful. He continued then a long time in teſtifying his love to <hi>Iſabella</hi> with high reſpects, magnificent preſents, frequent viſits, with tears, and intreaties: but the more ſubmiſſion he uſed, the more conſtancy <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhewed, and the more ſhe made it appear that her vertue was invincible. Nevertheleſs for all her rigor, and that love cannot ſubſiſt, as they ſay, without hope, yet <hi>Soliman</hi> ceaſed to hope without ceaſing to love; and contrarily his paſſion becoming more violent, that little reaſon, which

That which carryed him the rather to this extream reſolution, was the thought he had that it would not peradventure be long before <hi>Ibrahim</hi> returned; and that a conqueror or conquered, the love which he bare to <hi>Iſabella</hi> would make him ſoon finiſh this war: for when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> went away with an abſolute power to treat of all things, without having new order from <hi>Soliman,</hi> he had aſſured him, that he would come and render him an account of his voyage himſelf, without ever ſending to him before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan,</hi> not knowing then at what time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> would return, and well foreſeeing that his voyage would not be long, if by ill fortune he had not received his laſt order, as he began to doubt, meant to try if he could obtain that by fear, which he could not obtain by love. In the mean time <hi>Iſabella</hi> lived in ſo great a melancholy, that all her vertue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy were not ſtrong enough to keep her from wiſhing, that death would ſpeedily deliver her out of the deplorable eſtate wherein ſhe was. She ſaw her ſelf far from <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means to hear from him, the place of her refuge become her priſon, the ſight of her friends forbidden her, <hi>Soliman</hi>'s perſecution dayly redoubling; <hi>in fine,</hi> ſhe was expoſed to moſt ſenſible miſeries without other conſolation, then that of the <hi>Sultana Aſteria's,</hi> and her dear Kinſwomans tears. Her friends on the other ſide, were not without unquietneſs; ſo long an abode at <hi>Constantinople</hi> poſſeſſed them with a great deal of grief; and the privation of the ſight of <hi>Iſabella</hi> very much troubled them; but at length, nothing reſting for them but patience to mitigate their diſpleaſure, they comforted themſelves as well as they could with the hope of <hi>Ibrahim's</hi> return, wherewith they were ſtill entertained from <hi>Iſabella;</hi> who not able to diminiſh her own misfortunes, endevored at leaſtwiſe to flatter thoſe of others with this hope that ſhe gave them: for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had ſtill permitted her to ſend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by a <hi>Capigibaſſi,</hi> in whom he abſolutely confided.</p>
               <p>All theſe illuſtrious perſons being in this deplorable eſtate, <hi>Soliman,</hi> thruſt on by deſpair and his love, went one day to <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s lodging, having firſt ſent a Command to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana Aſteria</hi> to go to that of <hi>Roxelana,</hi> for ſhe had for a pretty while before been ſeldom ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Princeſs. This command exceedingly diſquieted the <hi>Sultana;</hi> but not able to do any other then voluntarily obey a Prince, who had power and right to conſtrain her thereunto; ſhe left <hi>Iſabella</hi> with <hi>Emilia,</hi> without letting her know any thing of the fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Scarcely was ſhe gone out of her chamber, when as <hi>Soliman</hi> came in to it; and whereas it ſeemed to her that he had leſs civility for her then he was wont; and that his looks gave more ſigns of choller, then of love; ſhe was in ſome joy, hoping that it may be her conſtancy had ſo far provoked him, as to oblige him to turn her out of the <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio;</hi> but ſhe ſoon underſtood, that this incivility, and this choller was an effect of his love.

How, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> then to him, can thy Highneſs perſwade me that which thou ſayſt? No, no, continued ſhe, I know thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue too well; and it is as equally impoſſible for thee to poſſeſs me with fear, as with love; thou mayſt have unjuſt deſires, but I hold thee uncapable of a wicked action. Thou mayſt, I ſay, have weakneſs, but not cruelty; and love cannot produce in thee the effects of hatred. It is not, added ſhe, becauſe I do not wiſh with all my heart, both for thy glory, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that either out of choller or hatred thou couldſt reſolve to chaſe me from thy preſence, and never to ſee me more.</p>

               <p>This review being ended, and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> throughly contented with it, he no longer thought of any thing but of haſtening his victory or defeature: ſo that to advance it the ſooner, after he had encamped his Army, and learnt in what place the Enemy was, he reſolved to write unto the <hi>Sophy,</hi> to the end he might oblige him to the terminating of this War by a Battel.

Never was there a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier or gallanter thing ſeen then theſe two Camps; nor Peace with all its abundance, what publique feaſts ſoever it hath cauſed, ever ſhewed more ſtate, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n War did at that time in theſe two Armies. For <hi>Soliman</hi> out of a particular grace was pleaſed that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſhould march with the ſame pomp in this voyage, as if he had been there in perſon; that the Officers, which are not accuſtomed to ſerve in it, but when he is there, ſhould accompany him; that thoſe Enſigns, which are never diſplayed but in his preſence, ſhould be ſet up; that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis,</hi> who fight not but before him, ſhould be preſent there; and that the ſame pavillions, which he himſelf uſed, ſhould be his. And whereas the cuſtom of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> is to lodg all the Soldiers in Tents, and that ordinarily they are all very ſumptuous, theſe two Camps ſhewed the goodlieſt object that can fall under the eye of man. There was nothing but Cloth of Gold and Tinſel in all <hi>Ibrahim's</hi> Pavillions, with Silver Creſſents, Penons, and Streamers on the top of them. The leaſt Tents were painted on the out-ſide with <hi>Arabeſque</hi> foliage of Gold and Silver, intermixt with different colours; and thoſe of the very Slaves were of Cotton Cloth of lively colours, and woven Checquerwiſe. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in the evening, out of a warlike gallantry, ſent to tell the <hi>Sophy</hi> that he was arrived, and deſired to receive his pleaſure: whereunto <hi>Tachmas</hi> anſwered, that the next morning at Sun-riſing he ſhould ſee him in the head of his Army. At laſt this ſo long expected day being come, ſcarcely had the firſt beams of the Sun begun to gild the tops of thoſe four high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which environ this Plain, but <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as well as <hi>Tachmas,</hi> drawing his Army out of their Trenches, put it into Battel array; and whereas he followed the order of the <hi>Turks</hi> in the greateſt part of exterior things, he ranged his Troops into the form of a Creſſent, but with this difference nevertheleſs, that contrary to the cuſtom of their Generals of Armies, he would be the foremoſt; and for that effect he placed himſelf between the right horn and the left, in the head of a Battalian of ſix thouſand <hi>Janizaries.</hi> He gave the Command of the left to the <hi>Beglierbey</hi> of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and of the right to the <hi>Baſſa Pialli.</hi> He cauſed part of his Ordnance to be ſet in the midſt; and to ſurprize the Enemy the more, the reſt was placed between two Battalions of Foot. He choſe four thouſand alſo from out of his Horſe to ride up and down about the Camp for the ſuccoring of thoſe that were in need. He placed his beſt Troops in the head and body of the Battel, leaving the rear-ward to the conduct of the <hi>Sangiac</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Perſians</hi> have more Horſe then Foot, he ſo well diſpoſed of his, that on what ſide ſoever they were aſſaulted, his Squadrons might make head on all parts. Order being given then every where, and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having gone more then once from Battalion to Battalion, and from rank to rank, to ſee that every one performed his duty, he began at length to ſpeak to his Troops much after this ſort.</p>

And whereas this action made all them that ſaw it give a great ſhout: You ſee, ſaid he, Fellow-Soldiers, that I have no intent to abandon you, ſince I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Tachmas,</hi> who knew the manner of the <hi>Turks</hi> fight, had ranged his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in battel array much after the ſame ſort, with this difference nevertheleſs, that whereas he had more Horſe then Foot, behinde the battalion which correſponded to that of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> in the head of whom <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had ſet himſelf, was a ſquadron of the moſt couragious Nobility of all his Empire, in the midſt of whom he was. And when as he ſaw that his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys Army moved, he cauſed his to ſet forward, ſo that theſe two great bodies advancing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually came within five hundred paces one of another; and by the manner of their march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it had been a very difficult matter to diſcern to which ſide the victory would lead.</p>

The two Armies made a ſtand to ſee this combat, which was beheld by both parts almoſt as an infallible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fage of the victory to that ſide of them two which ſhould carry it from the other. As ſoon as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> and <hi>Deliment</hi> were met, they fell to fighting, either of them having too great a heart for to ſtand reproaching and reviling one another. At firſt, <hi>Deliment</hi> fought like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate man, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> like one, who without loſing his judgment, or otherwiſe tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made it nevertheleſs ſufficiently appear by the manner of his carriage, that he was reſolved either to vanquiſh or to dye. Signs of fury were ſeen in the one, and proofs of an invincible courage in the other; the firſt ſtruck with violence, and inconſiderately; and the laſt, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf valiantly ſome times to his Enemies blows, aſſaulted him with judgment, and warded with addreſs: But at length after they had made an hundred paſſades to no purpoſe, had tryed in vain to gain the crupper, and had been a long time without hurting one another; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> ſeeming to be vext for ſtaying ſo long from vanquiſhing or dying, redoubled his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devors, and preſſing his Enemy more vively then before, he had at length the ſatisfaction to ſee his blood firſt, with a blow of his Scymitar, which he layd at his ſhoulder but lighted on his thigh. This firſt advantage more augmented <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s courage, and redoubled <hi>Deliment</hi>'s rage; for after that it was impoſſible to diſcern the blows they gave each another: <hi>Deliment</hi> was in continual action, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> no more then he, loſt not a minutes time; and without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers recoyling, or taking breath, they fought very neer an hour, and yet it could not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to which ſide the victory inclined. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s Turbant was all in pieces, he had alſo receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wound on his left arm, his Scymitar was dyed with the blood of <hi>Deliment,</hi> whom he had hurt in two places, when as in an inſtant flying violently at him, he diſcharged ſo great a blow with his Scymitar on his neck, that falling from his horſe, he extended him dead at his feet. This fall made all thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi>'s party to ſhout for joy, but he without longer tarrying in that pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> having obſerved that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> was wounded on the left arm by the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60144:218"/> blood which came out of it, would not have had him fought; but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> not conſenting thereunto, onely cauſed his arm to be bound up with a piece of linnen cloth of a Turbant; and placing himſelf by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and all the Trumpets, Drums, and <hi>Attaballes</hi> having ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a charge, they began to march with thoſe great cries, which all the <hi>Oriental</hi> Nations make at the beginning of battels; but yet with this difference, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Soldiers ſeemed to be almoſt aſſured of the victory, whereas the others on the contrary ſeemed to have no other deſign in fighting, then to revenge the death of <hi>Deliment:</hi> It was not for that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, but becauſe the <hi>Sophy</hi> ſhewed ſo much reſentment for it, as it paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d even into the hearts of his men. In the end theſe two Armies being provoked, the one by the deſire of glory, and the other by that of revenge, they encountred together. And to give yet a further courage to <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s forces, it happened that <hi>Tachmas,</hi> being arrived firſt in the field, had ſeized on an high piece of ground, upon the which he had planted his Ordnance; but that which he conceived would have been advantageous, proved unprofitable unto him; for when as the two Armies cauſed their Cannon to play on either part, that of the <hi>Perſians</hi> did no hurt to the <hi>Turks,</hi> becauſe all the ſhot paſſed over their heads in regard it was planted too high. <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Ordnance wrought another effect, and his firſt diſcharge lighting juſt in the midſt of that Sq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>adron, where the <hi>Sophy</hi> was in perſon, cleared all the ranks, with the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a world of men. But when as the <hi>Sophy,</hi> who loſt not his judgment in this occaſion, had commanded thoſe behinde to take the place of them before, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> on his ſide, cauſed two battalions, behinde the which were the reſt of his Ordnance, to open, and the Soldiers having accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngly divided themſelves to the right hand and to the left, the remainder of his Ordnance diſcharged all together through the voyd ſpace that was between the ranks, and put his Enemies into ſo ſtrange a diſorder, as the like was never heard of. And truly it was advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that the thickneſs of the ſmoke and duſt, which enveloped theſe two Armies, kept them from ſeeing the horridneſs of this execution, for otherwiſe peradventure they would not have had ſo much heart to fight, as they teſtified afterwards.</p>
               <p>At length, <hi>Tachmas</hi> having formed his battalions anew, for repairing of the diſorder which the great Ordnance had made, and <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Soldiers having re-aſſumed their ſtations, theſe two Armies came to cope with one another. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> followed by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama,</hi> gave firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the battalion, behinde the which was that broken ſquadron, where the <hi>Sophy</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> were in perſon. And it was there, where out of a prodigious valor he did things, which would not finde belief with poſterity, if they were written. He made way through all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and not contented with carrying fear and terror whereſoever he went; with defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own life, and giving death to his Enemies; but took care alſo for the conſervation of his own party. He ſaved the <hi>Baſſa Sinan</hi> from being killed, by diſcharging a great blow with his Scymitar upon him that was ſtriking him: now though he performed the Soldier in this encounter, yet left he not for all that to behave himſelf like the General of the Army, and to have an eye to all things. Sometimes he ſent to ſuccor thoſe that ſtood in need; ſometimes he went to them in perſon, and joyning both prudence and valor together, it might be ſaid, that never two ſeveral men exerciſed them ſo nobly, as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in his perſon alone made them to appear in this occaſion. And the courſe that he held was ſuch, in ſending his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to every part, as it might alſo be affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lama</hi> in like manner worthily ſeconded his valor; and all the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> ſeeing in the head of them ſo couragious a Chieftain, performed their parts ſo well in this encounter, that they pierced quite through this battalion, and ſo abſolutely defeated it, as all that the ſquadron which was behinde it could do, was to ſet the perſon of <hi>Tachmas</hi> out of danger.</p>
               <p>But whil'ſt <hi>Ibrahim</hi> fought ſo proſperouſly, the <hi>Beglierbey</hi> of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> who commanded the left wing, had not the like fortune; for finding himſelf oppoſed to the beſt Soldiers of the Enemies Army, who were commanded by one <hi>Baſingir,</hi> a man of great conſideration with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> his battalion had been broken at the very firſt, and the Enemies inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling amongſt them, had killed part of them, and made the reſt to fly, in beating them even to the body of their battel. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> having been advertiſed of this diſorder, left <hi>

When he arrived there, and ſaw his

This ſpeech filled them with confuſion, and this confuſion having redoubled their courage they rallyed themſelves about him. But when as notwithſtanding he ſaw that thoſe words were not ſufficient to make them fight valiantly enough, he went to one of thoſe who carryed the Arms of the Empire, and taking the Enſign out of his hand, he threw it with all his force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midſt of the Enemies, and turning about to his men; <hi>Come, Fellow-Soldiers,</hi> ſaid he unto them, <hi>we muſt dye, or recover it.</hi> This action gave new ſtrength to the <hi>Turks;</hi> for whereas amongſt them the greateſt diſgrace that can arrive to their Troops, is to let the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with whom they fight take the Arms of the Empire: the deſign of recovering this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had thrown amongſt the Enemies, infuſed the deſire of glory, and fear of infamy into their ſouls. At length the one ſide purpoſing to keep it, and the other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it, there began ſo fierce a ſight betwixt them, as it was in this place where the greateſt ſlaughter was made. Wounds, in ſtead of weakening thoſe which received them, ſeemed to incenſe their fury. There were men ſeen covered all over with blood and hurts, who in fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down dead gave death unto others.

               <p>The <hi>Sophy</hi> ſeeing his whole battel broken, a great part of his men dead, and fear in all the reſt, thought no longer but of making a retreat, and putting his perſon in ſafety, that he might not fall into the power of his Enemies; and to facilitate the means thereof, he commanded ſix thouſand Horſe, which were coaſting the Army, to ſet upon <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Reer-guard, who had not yet fought; thinking thereby to make a diverſion, and give him the means to retire with ſome order, things being no longer in terms for him to hope that he could keep the field.

And whereas of all apprehenſions fear is that which more ſpeedily paſſeth from one heart to another amongſt the Soldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs, the <hi>Sophy</hi> was no ſooner ſeen to think of retiring, but his Troops were ſtraightway poſſeſt with terror: The Enemy appeared more redoubtable to

               <p>
                  <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in the mean while omitted no time; and perceiving by the Enemies countenance, that they were no longer carryed by the deſire of vanquiſhing, but onely by that of ſaving themſelves, he redoubled his endevors, and cauſing all the Troops of his Army, which had not yet fought, to fall on all together, he put that of the Enemies into ſo fearful a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, that it was no longer either figh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For in one place, a battalion was ſeen to ſtand firm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue fighting; in another a Squadron that retired without breaking; but almoſt every where the Horſe and Foot were ſeen mingled together; the Souldiers abandoning their Colours, and throwing away their Arms; ſome yielding themſelves to their Enemies; others killing Horſe-men, that they might have their Horſes to fly away with the more ſpeed and ſafety; the Cannon left without defence; the baggage expoſed to plunder; all the Commanders without any power over their Soldiers; the moſt of them not knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they would command; in the end, if the night had not arrived, I believe that not one of the <hi>Perſians</hi> had been in an eſtate to fight, and that <hi>Tachmas</hi> would have fallen into the power of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> but darkneſs coming on ſtole him from his victory: For <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> having rallyed all the Nobleſs about him that he had left, commanded four Thouſand Horſe, and two Thouſand Foot, to go and amuſe the Enemy, whil'ſt he retired. And theſe Troops were they alone, which ſhewed in the concluſion of this battel, that they merited not their misfortune; for at length, by the reſiſtance which they made, though it was not long, they gave <hi>Tachmas</hi> opportunity to retire into <hi>Sultania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to keep the victory from deſtroying his Army, after that he and <hi>

               <p>VVHereas it is not enough to have vanquiſhed, if one does not know how to uſe the victory, the Illuſtrious Baſſa knew too well how to make uſe of the advantages of fortune, for to neglect his enemy after he had ſurmounted him. He was not ignorant that the chance of war is inconſtant; that Conquerors may oftentimes be Slaves to thoſe whom they have put in chains; and that the Crowns which Victory hath ſet on the head of thoſe whom ſhe favours, are not ſo well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but that they may be plucked from thence. Out of ſo juſt a reaſoning, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> took as much care to have good order obſerved in his Army, as if that of <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had been ſtill in the field, and had not been defeated. He diſcamped then the next day, and ſtill advancing into the Enemies Countrey, without incountring any obſtacle, he carried terror over all the Perſian Empire. For whereas the Sophie; Army had been utterly routed, they which had not followed him to <hi>Sultania,</hi> and that had eſcaped killing in the battell, fled to the next adjoyning Provinces, and by their report wrought that in the mindes of thoſe that heard them, which the Arms of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had wrought in them, poſſeſſing their hearts with fear and terror. And whereas it is naturall enough for a man to ſeek to excuſe himſelf, they made the Army of the Turks far greater than it was, for the juſtifying of their flight; they commended the valour of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to cover their own cowardice, and fighting for him in this occaſion, they induced many Towns to render themſelves, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had at leaſtwiſe attended the Canon, and the fight of their Enemy. But whereas the moſt part of the Palaces in this Empire are not much fortified, and are commonly his that keeps the field, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> being become ſo abſolutely Maſter of it, as there was not an enemy appearing, he had no other imployment after the battell of <hi>Niphates,</hi> than to receive the Deputies of Towns which came to bring him the keyes thereof; and one would have ſaid, conſidering in what manner things paſt, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was rather a lawfull King, that rode in progreſs about his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to make himſelf known to his Subjects, than a Conqueror, which received the ſubmiſſions of the people whom he had ſubdued. In fine, the matter went in that ſort, as in two moneths ſpace the Grand Viſier reſtored unto <hi>Solimans</hi> obedience all the places which he had formerly conquered, and that had revolted after <hi>Ulamaes</hi> defeat, and during the time of his ſickneſs. In the mean while he had ſent to Prince <hi>Mahamed</hi> and to <hi>Axiamira,</hi> to aſſure them that he did not conquer their Countrey but only to oblige the Sophy to demand peace; and if it ſhould be long before he heard from him, he would ſend to propound it unto him, with ſuch juſt conditions, as he could not refuſe it. <hi>Ulama</hi> likewiſe on his part had written to the Princeſs and <hi>Felixana,</hi> who had not failed to teſtifie unto him by their Letters a great deal of acknowledgement for the victory which he had obtained of <hi>Deliment. Axiamira</hi> was nevertheleſs much diſquieted, to underſtand by all them which came from the Camp to <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> that ſince <hi>Tachmas</hi> entred into <hi>Sultania,</hi> there had been no news of him: For albeit the Sophy had intreated her very ill, yet ſtill he was her Father, and the apprehenſions of Nature were yet ſtronger in her heart, than the remembrance of injuries was ſenſible unto her. This unquietneſs was not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to her, and though it was after a different faſhion, yet certain it is, that the Grand Viſier was troubled, for that he could learn nothing of <hi>Tachmas;</hi> not being able to imagine what deſign he ſhould have in ſhutting himſelf up in <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and never appearing ſince, nor giving any order for ſetting ſome forces on foot again. One morning as he was talking with <hi>Ulama</hi> about it, and that neither of them knew what to think of it, one came and told him, that one named <hi>Morath,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Galley of the Baſſa of the Seas Fleet, deſired to ſpeak with him. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who knew the order which this Baſſa had had to make ſome deſcent into <hi>Mingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> thereby to divert the enemies forces, believed that he came to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt thereof, and therefore commanded him to be brought in: Which was no
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60144:220"/> ſooner done, but <hi>Morath,</hi> after he had ſaluted him with an high reſpect, told him, that having been acquainted by fame with the proſperous ſucceſs of his Arms, and that he was in a condition to impoſe Laws on the vanquiſhed, he was ſent from the Baſſa of the Sea to beg a grace of him in favour of <hi>Arſalon.</hi> This name equally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized both <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Ulama;</hi> for the Grand Viſier remembred very well that this <hi>Arſalon</hi> was he who had taken <hi>Doria</hi> neer to <hi>Naples;</hi> that he was Father to <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bech,</hi> whom <hi>Oſman</hi> the Baſſa of the Seas ſon had maried; but he could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how they ſhould meet together, and be made friends: <hi>Ulama</hi> knew too, by report, that the Satrap <hi>Arſalon</hi> was become the famouſeſt Pirate of all the Seas of the <hi>Levant;</hi> ſo that both of them provoked by curioſity, preſſed <hi>Morath</hi> to explain himſelf more clearly. My Lord, ſaid he to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> before I tell you what <hi>Arſalon</hi> deſires, may you be pleaſed to let me relate unto you the ſequele of an Hiſtory, the beginning whereof you are acquainted with, to the end that by the knowledge you ſhall have thereof, you may be the more eaſilier carried to grant the favour which is deſired of your generoſity. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having conſented thereunto, cauſed every one to go out of his Tent, except <hi>Ulama,</hi> and they two being ſet, <hi>Morath</hi> ſpake in this ſort.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Make no doubt, my Lord, but if the generoſity of <hi>Alibech</hi> moved you at ſuch time, as by your goodneſs you got the Grand Signior to judge her cauſe to her advantage, I make no doubt, I ſay, but that which I am going to impart unto you will carry you to ſerve her. I will not ſtand to run over her firſt adventures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make you underſtand the reſt, ſince I hold it impoſſible that you ſhould not ſtill remember, that ſhe is the daughter of <hi>Arſalon</hi> the Pirate, or to ſay better, of a Satrap of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whom ill fortune hath made a Pirate. And I do not think you have forgot that this Pirate took <hi>Oſman</hi> priſoner, who in a few dayes became deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in love with the vertuous <hi>Alibech,</hi> and that ſhe delivering him, ſaved her ſelf with him, upon condition that he ſhould marry her when he came to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> No more can you be ignorant that the Baſſa of the Sea would never have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſon to have kept his word with her, had not the Grand Signior by his commandment, and by his liberality, forced him to receive this fair Maid, in whom he found no other defect but poverty. Now ſince that, my Lord, I can aſſure you, that <hi>Alibech</hi> hath not rendred her ſelf unworthy of the grace you did her, nor of that which yet ſhe attends from your goodneſs. She hath lived with the Baſſa of the Sea in as much obedience to him, as if ſhe had been his own daughter; and with her ſubmiſſions and reſpects hath in ſuch ſort acquired his affection, as he loves not his ſon with more tenderneſs. As for <hi>Oſman,</hi> there hath never been heard ſpeak of a more violent, or more durable love than his, and every day too he ſees ſome new grace in his dear <hi>Alibech;</hi> for whereas the beauty of her ſoul is far greater than that of her face, ſhe hath given him ſo many new marks of her vertue, of her courage, of her love, and of her generoſity, as he ſhould be the ingratefulleſt of men, if the affection which he bears her, could enter into compariſon with any other. This perſon then, being ſo ſtraightly linked in good will to her Father-in-Law, and to her husband, could not reſolve to abandon them, at ſuch time as the Baſſa of the Sea was conſtrained to imbark himſelf for to go and command the Fleet, which was ſent into <hi>Mingrelia.</hi> And although, out of the fear they were in leſt ſhe ſhould receive ſome incommoditie, they did all they could to keep her from it, yet was it impoſſible for them to prevail with her. No, no, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Oſman,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leave you; and ſeeing I could follow a father out of obedience, I can better follow an husband out of affection. I am already inured to the diſcommodities of the Sea, which no doubt will be ſweeter to me, ſharing them with you, than reſt would be agreeable unto me, if I ſhould enjoy it without you. If you fight with advantage, added ſhe, the joy which I ſhall have of your victory will redouble
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60144:220"/> yours; and if by misfortune you be vanquiſhed, which Heaven forſend, my tears ſhall fight for you, when you no longer can. In fine, ſaid ſhe further, tempeſts, war, ſlavery, yea and death it ſelf, would be ſweeter to me, than a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>Alibech</hi> having in this ſort touched the heart of <hi>Oſman,</hi> and the Baſſa of the Sea being overcome by her intreaties, ſhe imbarqued her ſelf with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was Vice-Admirall under his Father. Their Navigation having been proſperous enough, untill they came to <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> they thought of no hing more than of chooſing a place where they might make a deſcent, according to the order they had for it: but a horrible tempeſt that aroſe, deſtroyed all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. It was ſo great, ſo long, and ſo extraordinary, that the whole Fleet was diſperſed; ſo that when it grew to be calm again, three Veſſells were ſcarce found together: Howbeit ſo great was our good fortune, as in four or five dayes the whole Navy rejoyned, and albeit moſt of the ſhips had ſomething, or other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet we rejoyced to ſee them all ſhattered as they were, after we had believed they were loſt. The two Veſſells of <hi>Oſman,</hi> and of the Baſſa of the Sea, were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting to the Fleet; but at length that of <hi>Oſman</hi> comming in, made us hope that the Baſſa would return in like manner. After he had been attended ſome dayes with an impatience, which well demonſtrated the love which <hi>Oſman,</hi> and the generoſity which <hi>Alibech</hi> had for him; and after that many Veſſells had been ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> out to croſs up and down the Sea, for to try if they could meet with him, one day as <hi>Oſman</hi> was looking forth himſelf to ſee if he could deſcry any thing, he diſcovered a Veſſell: and though it was ſo far off as he could not diſcern of what Nation ſhe was, yet the extreme deſire which he had that it might be his fathers, perſwaded him that it was he. In this belief he cauſed his dear <hi>Alibech</hi> to come upon the deck to let her ſee that which all the reſt of his Veſſell ſaw as well as he; they continued a pretty while in this ſort, between hope and fear, but at length this Veſſell approaching by little and little, deſtroyed the firſt, and increaſed the other; for <hi>Oſman</hi> certainly knew that this Veſſell was a Brigantine, and not that of his father, whoſe fortune had been very different from his. The tempeſt having ſevered him from his Fleet, and the ſtorm having mightily bruiſed his Veſſell, he had been ſo unhappy as to encounter with a Pirate; who having found him in ſo deplorable an eſtate, had ſet upon him, or to ſay better, had taken him, he not being able to make any reſiſtance. The Baſſa of the Sea after this misfortune, was perſwaded, that to be the more gently uſed, and to get the ſooner out of his enemies hands, he was to tell who he was, to the end that offering a great ranſom he might be reſtored to his liberty; the rather, for that in this occaſion the affairs of the Empire being much concerned, he ſhould have committed a crime, if he had concealed his name for the ſaving of money. But that which he thought would conduce moſt to the getting himſelf out of trouble, gave him the more; for be pleaſed to know, that by an encounter altogether prodigious, he that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him was the Pirate <hi>Arſalon,</hi> father to the vertuous <hi>Alibech;</hi> who no ſooner underſtood that this priſoner was the Baſſa of the Sea, but he appeared to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily incenſed with anger. What, ſaid he unto him, are you the father then of the Traytor <hi>Oſman,</hi> or to ſay better, of the Raviſher of my daughter? and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who hath alwayes perſecuted me ſo cruelly, at laſt furniſhed me with means to be revenged? Speak, ſaid he unto him, but diſguiſe not the truth, leſt I be drawn to make you tell it by force. The Baſſa of the Sea ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe, and perceiving very well that this Pirate was <hi>Arſalon,</hi> thought nevertheleſs, ſince he had ſaid ſo much already, that the beſt would be not to diſſemble, and to indeavour by the aſſurance which he would give him that <hi>Alibech</hi> was <hi>Oſmans</hi> wife, and that he had alwayes uſed her as if ſhe had been his own daughter, to induce him to uſe him alſo with the more humanity. In this reſolution, I acknowledge, ſayd he unto him, that I am the Baſſa of the Sea, that I am the father of <hi>Oſman,</hi> and the father of the raviſher of <hi>Alibech;</hi> but withall, you are to acknowledge to me alſo, that I am the father of your daughter, ſeeing ſhe hath maried my ſonne; and you are conſequently to confeſs, that ſince love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60144:221"/> hath been the cauſe of their fault, you ought to pardon them for it; if ſo be you have not loſt the remembrance, that the very ſame paſſion made you in times paſt forget all things. I have not loſt the remembrance of it, replyed <hi>Arſalon,</hi> but I remember the puniſhment too that was inflicted on me; and if I treat my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after the ſame manner, ſhe will have no juſt occaſion to complain. If you knew, anſwered the Baſſa of the ſea, what the affection of <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech</hi> were, it would touch your heart: It is ſo great, continued he, that in the voyage, which I have ſo unhappily undertaken, ſhe would by no means abandon her husband. <hi>Arſalon</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, made him explane it more particularly unto him; and knew that his daughter was not very far from him: Whereat he teſtified a great deal of joy, and beholding the Baſſa with a ſmile full of bitterneſs; to ſhew you, ſaid he unto him, that I am generous, and that I will not confound the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent with the guilty; I will not uſe you ill; nay I will not require ſonne, though as my ſlave I might do it; but I will only have that which appertains to me, that is to ſay, the ingratefull and unnaturall <hi>Alibech.</hi> I do you a good office, ſayd he unto him, raiſing his voice; for ſince ſhe could betray her father, and abandon him, ſhe would quit you no doubt, and betray you as well as me. The Baſſa, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with this diſcourſe and demand, ſtood a while without anſwering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; nevertheleſs, whereas he is generous, and that the vertue of <hi>Alibech</hi> hath won his heart, he could by no means agree to what was required of him. No, ſayd he to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> I will never be ingratefull to your daughter; ſhe reſtored my ſonne to his liberty, and I will loſe mine to preſerve her that which ſhe enjoyes. And then again; ſaid he unto him, I am not maſter of her, ſhe is <hi>Oſmans,</hi> who commanding the Navy in my abſence, is in an eſtate to refuſe her unto me, if I ſhould be ſo baſe as to demand her, which I will never do. We ſhall ſee, ſaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi> then to him, whether you will not change your mind; and after they had diſputed yet a while, he commanded him to be loaden with chains, and told him once again, that he ſhould never have his liberty, and that every day he would make him try new torments, if he did not write to his ſonne to oblige him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Alibech</hi> into the hands of thoſe whom he would ſend to him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; promiſing him, that ſhe ſhould be no ſooner in his power, but he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his liberty. The Baſſa in ſo croſs a conjuncture, knew not what to think, or what to reſolve on. He knew by the report of his ſonne, and of <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bech</hi> too, that <hi>Arſalon</hi> was firm in his reſolutions, and of a ſevere and cruell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. He knew that his abſence would prejudice the affairs of the Empire; yea and he was perſwaded, that his ſonne, loving <hi>Alibech</hi> more than his life, would never reſolve to loſe her for the ſaving of him; he felt a ſtrange repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his heart too againſt the making of this requeſt unto him; and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do in ſo deplorable a caſe, he lamented his misfortune, accuſed <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalons</hi> cruelty, and without framing any deſign, indured the ſharpeſt grief that any ſoul can be capable of. In the mean time <hi>Arſalon,</hi> fearing leſt the Baſſa of the Seas Fleet ſhould remove further from him, and that then he ſhould not have <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libech</hi> ſo eaſily, preſſed him to take his laſt reſolution: but what threatnings ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he could uſe unto him, he could not poſſibly draw him to write to <hi>Oſman</hi> to oblige him to give <hi>Alibech</hi> for his ranſom. <hi>Arſalon</hi> did all that he could to ſhake his reſolution; he aſſured him of a perpetuall ſlavery; he made him ſee that his death was indubitable; and perceiving at laſt that he no whit prevailed, he choſe out one of the moſt underſtanding and reſoluteſt men of his company, and giving him a Brigantine, he ſent him towards a Cape, where he had learnt the Fleet was reaſſembled; and having told him he would ſtay for him at a creek which was not far from thence, he willed him to ſearch ſo diligently, that he might find out the Baſſa of the Seas Navy; and having found it, that he ſhould deliver to <hi>Oſman</hi> his ſonne, who commanded in his abſence, the meſſage which he would impart unto him; whereupon rowning him ſoftly in the ear, he inſtructed him with his intentions, and diſpatched him inſtantly away. This man, who was a Perſian by Nation, exactly obeyed him, and was ſo fortunate, as he ſayled directly to the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60144:221"/> place where the Baſſa of the Seas Fleet were all joyned together again. And it was, my Lord, the very ſame veſſell which <hi>Oſman</hi> diſcovered at ſea, which a far off gave him ſo much hope, and which approaching ſo mightily redoubled his grief, to ſee that it was a Brigantine, that the ſpight to be ſo deceived, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to fight with her: For which effect he commanded two of his veſſels to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque her; but the Perſian who had no deſign to endanger himſelf to no purpoſe, perceiving the intention of them that were making towards him, ſtruck ſayl, hung out a flag of truce, and putting himſelf into the skiff, with three of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to teſtifie the more confidence, he went in this ſort to encounter thoſe which were advanced towards him. When he was ſo near them as he might be heard, the <hi>Perſian,</hi> to have audience the ſooner, required to ſpeak with <hi>Oſman</hi> from the Baſſa of the Sea his father.

In the mean time <hi>Oſman</hi> having been advertiſed of it, attended with as much joy as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, him, that brought him news of his father. And whereas he ſhared all his bad, and all his hood haps with his dear wife, ſhe was with him at ſuch time as the <hi>Perſian</hi> was conducted unto him. The ſight of this man made the vertuous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libech</hi> change colour, for ſhe preſently knew him, as having ſeen him with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the time that ſhe lived at ſea. This firſt motion was quickly ſeconded with an extreme grief; for when as <hi>Oſman,</hi> out of an impatience derived from his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, had demanded of this man where his father was; My Lord, ſaid he unto him, with a great deal of boldneſs, he is in a place from whence you may eaſily draw him, and to clear the matter unto you, know, that the chance of War, or rather the equity of Heaven, hath made him fall into the power of the invincible <hi>Arſalon.</hi> Alas, ſaid <hi>Alibech,</hi> looking on <hi>Oſman,</hi> what have I heard! and what a deſtiny is ours like to be! What, ſaid <hi>Oſman,</hi> interrupting her, and all amazed, is my father in the hands of <hi>Arſalon?</hi> Yes, my Lord, replyed the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and it is from him that I come to tell you, that you ſhall never ſee the Baſſa your father more, if you do not render him his daughter: This is the price he hath ſet for his liberty, and it is that which you ought to pay him. I know that I ſpeak boldly, and that in ſome ſort I endanger my ſelf; but be-think you that you have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the power of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> which ought to keep you from entreating me ill. I leave you to judge, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> what this propoſition effected in the minds of <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech,</hi> and what a combat that was, where one muſt reſolve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon a father, or loſe a wife; yea a wife, to whom <hi>Oſman</hi> owed his life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: which made up all his felicity; and which was both his wife and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris. Nature and Love could not be ſatisfied in this occaſion: <hi>Oſman</hi> could not be acknowledging without being ingratefull; and finding cruelty in both the parties, he knew not what reſolution to take. <hi>Oſman</hi> never reaſoned at firſt for all that on this adventure, but without ſticking a whit at it, he told him that had ſpoken to him, how he could not render his wife, neither could he abandon his father, but he kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w well enough how to deſtroy <hi>Arſalon.</hi> Ah, my Lord, cryed <hi>Alibech</hi> then, who had done nothing as yet but weep, being ſcarce able to form a word; If the Baſſa of the ſea is your father, <hi>Arſalon</hi> is mine; and you cannot hurt him without wronging me. <hi>Oſman</hi> being come again out of this firſt tranſport, and raviſhed with <hi>Alibeches</hi> generoſity, craved pardon of her: and this <hi>Perſian</hi> returning to ſpeak, I know, my Lord, ſayd he unto him, that this choice is hard to be made, wherefore permit me to go back to my veſſell, and let me within a day have your anſwer; but conſult with your reaſon, remember that <hi>Alibech</hi> is the daughter of him that demands her, and that the Baſſa of the Sea is the father of a man that ſtole her away. If <hi>Oſman</hi> had followed his firſt thoughts, he had cauſed this man to be thrown into the Sea, but fearing leſt ſuch violence ſhould prejudice his father, he choſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ather to grant his demand. When he was gone away, and that without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſes than his dear <hi>Alibech</hi> he might let his grief break forth; Do not think, ſayd he unto her, that I conſult whether I ſhould deliver you into the hands
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60144:222"/> of <hi>Arſalon;</hi> no, that is not my thought; but I am conſidering which way I may deliver my Father: For in fine, it is equally impoſſible for me to reſolve to love him, and abandon you. I ow my life to both of you; I ow obedience to my Father, and love to <hi>Alibech:</hi> If my death could ſatisfie you both, I ſhould dye no doubt with joy; but fortune that delights to pick me out extraordinary miſeries, will not let any thing be able to ſuccour me. The more I conſider the matter, the leſs remedy do I finde for it; which way ſoever I look upon it, I am ſtill guilty, and ſtill unhappy. I cannot break my fathers chains without giving them to you; I cannot end his puniſhment, but in beginning yours; I cannot reſtore him his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but in depriving you of it, nor can ſave his life, but in putting yours in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy; and that is it which is abſolutely impoſſible for me to do. But, added he, if I conſerve you, I load my father with irons; I my ſelf faſten the ſhackles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is bound; I am the cauſe of his captivity, and it may be of his death; I am a parricide, and I ſtab a dagger into the heart of him that gave me life. See generous <hi>Alibech,</hi> ſaid he unto her, what the choice is which I can make in ſo croſs an adventure. My Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, wholly diſſolved into tears, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a counſell of me which is very hard to be given; it is not becauſe I fear the rigor of my father ſo much, as I cannot reſolve without pain to indure it to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yours; but, my Lord, it is becauſe I cannot do it without abandoning you. Yet I muſt, continued ſhe; for whereas I am the daughter of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> it is for me to receive the chaſtiſement of her fault; and whereas I am in part the cauſe of his captivity, it is for me alſo to deliver him; and it is for me alſo to dry up the tears which you ſhed for him: Suffer me then to go and undo his chains, and wear his irons. Ah! too generous <hi>Alibech,</hi> anſwered <hi>Oſman,</hi> do not offer me a remedy worſe than the diſeaſe, and which I cannot accept of: My father is too generous too, continued he, to indure it; and he would diſavow me for his ſonne, if I were capable of ſuch a baſeneſs. To have ſuch thoughts would be a thing worthy of his great heart, replyed <hi>Alibech,</hi> but it would alſo be a thing unworthy both of you, and of me, if I could ſuffer you to be cruell to the Baſſa your father, and that he ſhould loſe his life by my means. No, <hi>Oſman,</hi> it is that which I can never indure; and ſince we cannot live happy together, let us at leaſtwiſe die innocent. Do what you ought for your father; owing him your life, you ow him all things; ſacrifiſe your wife to deliver him, it is juſt, and ſhe deſires it. I muſt, added ſhe, for the love of you, deprive my ſelf of you; and fear not that I will accuſe you of want of affection, whenas you ſhall conſent thereunto; no, <hi>Oſman,</hi> I ſhould not be glad that your love to me ſhould ſtifle the motions of nature in you. Reaſon muſt be ſtronger than all other things; and he that could abandon his father, might alſo in ſome other occaſion abandon his wife. Permit me to do what I ought, and leave the reſt to the conduct of fortune. That would not be juſt, anſwered <hi>Oſman.</hi> What will you do then, replyed <hi>Alibech?</hi> I do not know, anſwered he; onely I know that the eſtate wherein my ſoul is, I can neither be wanting to my father, nor to you; and yet being unable to ſave you both, I ſee that nothing but death can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me. After this, <hi>Oſman</hi> fell a muſing, then ſuddenly comming to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſeemed to take the reſolution to go and ſeek out <hi>Arſalon</hi> for to fight with him. But <hi>Alibech</hi> having apprehended his deſign, What, my Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, caſting her ſelf at his feet, could you command your men to ſhoot at a Veſſell where your father or mine might be killed, and it may be both of them? Could that ſo generous heart of yours permit you to dip your hands in my blood or in yours? Think well, my Lord, of that which you ſay; and know that I am capable of taking away mine own life, rather than ſee you blemiſh your glory with ſo ſtrange an action; whereas then you would not be carried thereunto, but only to ſave my life, whenas I ſhould be deprived of it, you would deal in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is true, my Lord, that my father is cruell, and inhuman; but remember, that when the Baſſa your father would have baniſhed us from his houſe, I left not reſpecting him; have the ſame thought for <hi>Arſalon:</hi> Regard him rather as a man whom misfortune hath bereft of reaſon, than as one that is wicked; and to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60144:222"/> ſay all, conſider him as my father. I do not refuſe to deliver oyurs, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I conjure you to permit me to do it, but have alſo the goodneſs to ſpare mine. Heaven can witneſs, anſwered <hi>Oſman,</hi> after he had raiſed her up, whether I have any intent to hurt <hi>Arſalon;</hi> no, <hi>Alibech,</hi> I will never do it; but in the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein my ſoul is, I ſay whatſoever my grief ſuggeſts unto me, without giving my reaſon leaſure to examine whether the thing be juſt, or whether it be not. In fine, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> after ſo long and ſo ſad a converſation, <hi>Oſman,</hi> not able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deliver his father, or deprive himſelf of his wife, or fight with <hi>Arſalon,</hi> reſolved at leaſt, and made <hi>Alibech</hi> reſolve ſo too, to go with all his Fleet, and ſet himſelf in the ſight of that of <hi>Arſalon;</hi> for all the Pirates of the ſeas of the <hi>Levant</hi> had a little before betaken themſelves to him, and acknowledged him for their Chieftain. It was nevertheleſs after he had promiſed <hi>Alibech,</hi> that he would not fight with him; and that it ſhould be only to endeavour to make him do that by fear vvhich he could not make him do by reaſon. All the difficultie of the matter was but to know preciſely where he was; but this obſtacle laſted not long: for <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> having ſent for the <hi>Perſian</hi> to come again to him, he talked to him with ſo much addreſs, that he learnt the place of his retreat; after which he told this man in a gentle manner, for fear his father ſhould be ill intreated, that before he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to the propoſition which had been made to him, he would willingly have a Letter from his father, to the end that being ſure he was living, he might deal with the more certainty. The <hi>Perſian</hi> finding ſome juſtice in <hi>Oſmans</hi> demand, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently left him, with a promiſe to return him an anſwer of it within a few days; but take heed, ſayd he unto him, that you go not away, for fear leſt <hi>Arſalon</hi> ſhould revenge himſelf on your father, if you ſhould deceive him. So <hi>Oſman</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſured him that he vvould not ſtir; and this <hi>Perſian</hi> having ſet ſayl, he made his whole Fleet to ſteer the ſame courſe; ſo that two dayes after, at the break of day, the Pirate <hi>Arſalon,</hi> who could not oblige the Baſſa to write to his ſonne, ſaw his whole Navy appear. At firſt his deſign was to fight with it, and to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he cauſed alſo his Fleet to be made ready; but when as that of <hi>Oſman</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and that enlarging it ſelf, he could diſtinctly count all the veſſels, whereof it was compoſed, he found it ſo great, and his ſo ſmall in compariſon of it, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it would have been temerity and folly in him, to hope for the Victory with ſo unequall a number, he took another reſolution: And after he had inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame <hi>Perſian</hi> whom he had formerly imployed, with his intentions, he ſent him back to <hi>Oſman;</hi> who ſeeing a veſſell looſe from <hi>Arſalons</hi> Fleet, and comming towards him, hoped that it might be his deſign had ſucceeded. <hi>Alibech</hi> was not of this opinion; and fear ſo abſolutely oppreſſed her ſoul, as there was no place left for hope: And truly ſhe had reaſon; for this man was no ſooner brought before <hi>Oſman,</hi> but he made it appear by the confuſion which he had in his countenance, that the meſſage which he was to deliver was fatall. I come hither, my Lord, ſayd he unto him, to tell you, that if you do not render <hi>Alibech,</hi> and do attempt to ſet upon <hi>Arſalon,</hi> he will make your father be ſlain before your eyes; and to deprive you too of the pleaſure of revenge, if he happen to have the worſt in the fight, he will blow up himſelf, and ſo ſteal from your victory. This ſtrange diſcourſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech</hi> in ſuch ſort, as they ſtood a good while beholding one another, and not able to ſpeak, but their reſentment ſuddenly breaking forth, they ſayd all that an extreme grief can make one think. It is no longer time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, ſaid the generous <hi>Alibech,</hi> our love would be criminall if it could produce ſo ſtrange an effect. Suffer me, my dear <hi>Oſman,</hi> ſuffer me to go and make tryall all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of my fathers fury; for provided I can reſtore you yours, death will not be altogether cruell to me. In vain you ſeek for other remedies to your miſerie; and as things ſtand, I ow my ſelf not only to him which hath given you life, but I ow my ſelf alſo to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd I may keep him from dipping his hands in innocent bloud. As for me, he may deal with me as he pleaſeth; I am his daughter; I have abandoned him; I have robbed him of two ſlaves; and if he can complain of any one, it muſt doubtleſs be of me. Your accuſing of your ſelf in this ſort, ſaid <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60144:223"/> then, is to put me in remembrance of the obligations wherein I ſtand engaged to you; and it is to ſay to me alſo, Do not abandon me. Do not you abandon me, anſwered ſhe, but ſuffer me to abandon you. I cannot, replyed <hi>Oſman.</hi> Bot could you indeed, ſayd <hi>Alibech</hi> to him, ſee a dagger in my fathers hand to ſtab the heart of yours? For my part, continued ſhe, I would rather dye. Let us die then, ſaid <hi>Oſman</hi> to her; for I tell you once again, that it is as equally impoſſible for me to reſolve to loſe my father, as to abandon you. In purſuance of this diſcourſe, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libech</hi> did yet what ſhe could to obtain her husbands permiſſion that ſhe might go to her father: She joyned tears to her prayers, and albeit that which ſhe deſired would deſtroy her felicity, bereave her of her liberty, expoſe her to the fury of her father, and deprive her of her husband, yet was ſhe ſo generous, as to omit nothing of whatſoever ſhe thought was capable of perſwading him not to refuſe her that ſhe demanded. But ſeeing at laſt that ſhe entreated in vain, and that <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> unable to reſolve on any thing, yet ſeemed to be reſolved not to render her, ſhe purpoſed to make uſe of a kinſman of the Baſſa of the ſea, whom ſhe had won after the firſt time that <hi>Arſalons</hi> Meſſenger came thither: And that ſhe might talk with him at liberty, and without ſuſpition, I ſee very well, ſayd ſhe to <hi>Oſman,</hi> that the tears which I ſhed to move your heart, do but harden it the more, and that as long as you ſee me, you can reſolve of nothing, wherefore ſuffer me to withdraw my ſelf, and remember, ſayd ſhe unto him, that the life of your father is in queſtion. After this, ſhe retired into the Captains cabbin, whither having ſent for the Baſſa of the Seas kinſman, who ſhe knew was very much affected, and greatly obliged to him, as holding his fortune of him; When he was come, and that ſhe could ſpeak to him without witneſſes, ſhe ſummoned him to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the promiſe he had made her two dayes before, to do any thing for the deliverance of the Baſſa of the ſea, when ſhe ſhould furniſh him with means for it. For rightly foreſeeing that <hi>Oſman</hi> would never reſolve to remit her into the hands of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> though he was very generous, and that he loved his father exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this courageous woman had forecaſt a way how to beguile him. After then that ſhe had asked of him, who was to ſerve her in her deſign, whether he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for it or no? and that ſhe had told him how all that ſhe would have of him was, that he would give her the opportunity the night following to go to <hi>Arſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> in the veſſel which he commanded. This man, albeit very much obliged to the Baſſa of the Sea, was notwithſtanding ſomewhat unwilling to conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But <hi>Alibech</hi> adding art to her entreaties, undertook to perſwade that to him, which ſhe did not beleeve her ſelf. She told him that her father would let himſelf be moved with her tears; that without doubt this generous action would touch him; and that ſo without expoſing her to any great danger, ſhe ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Baſſa of the Sea. This man then ſuffering himſelf to be carried to what ſhe pleaſed, promiſed her not to go aboard his veſſel till it was very late, and that the night was far ſpent, to the end that ſtealing away, he might get her into the skiff that was to carry him thither; which without doubt might be eaſily enough done, it being credible, that in the agitation wherein the mind of <hi>Oſman</hi> was, he would not take much heed to things. The execution of this enterpriſe proved yet more facile than <hi>Alibech</hi> had imagined it, as you ſhall underſtand by and by. <hi>Oſman,</hi> not knowing what to do in ſo croſs an incounter, after that <hi>Alibech</hi> vvas withdravvn, fell into a deep muſe, and began to caſt in his mind what he might doe. He no ſooner formed one thought, but it vvas deſtroyed by another; his imagination propounded nothing unto him vvhich his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could approve of; the motions of nature combated thoſe of love; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanquiſhing one another, <hi>Oſman</hi> was not ſurmounted but by his own grief. He ſaw in every thing cauſe of diſpair, and whereas he had a noble and generous Soul, being unable to take any reſolution which was not criminall, he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alwaies irreſolute. But at laſt, after he had a long time debated with himſelf; after that love and nature had made him think of all that they could inſpire in a like incounter; after that he had ſought for an hundred unprofitable meanes how
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60144:223"/> to deliver his father, without loſing his wife; no, no, ſaid he to himſelfe, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe <hi>Alibech,</hi> but I muſt loſe my ſelf too. Let us reſolve upon it then, and make the Baſſa our Father ſee, that we doe for him all that we can. He hath given me life, I am ready to render it to him again; and I cannot think that Heaven would approve of the delivering of an innocent to the crueltie of <hi>Arſalon;</hi> neither doe I think too, added he, but his revenge would be more ſatisfied with having me in his hands, than with having <hi>Alibech.</hi> And albeit he hath not demanded me aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as ſhe, it was doubtleſs becauſe he beleeved, that I would render him my wife, rather than render him my ſelf. But alas cryed he, how was he ill informed of my thoughts! As for my Father, ſaid he, I may not beleeve that he can complain of me, ſince I indanger my ſelf for the love of him. And as for <hi>Arſalon,</hi> he will in my perſon find an object worthy of his wrath; it is I that ſtole away his daughter from him; it is I that was the cauſe of the flight of that generous Slave, from whom hee expected ſo many things; in fine, I alone am culpable; and if there be any juſtice in his cruelty, I alone too ſhall be puniſhed. He ſhall deliver my Father, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhall wear yrons with him; and if rage carries him to take away my life, I ſhall howſoever have the ſatisfaction to dye, without having abandoned, either my Father, or my wife. I owe my life to my Father, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall render it to him again, in loſing it for his ſake. I owe my liberty to the generous <hi>Alibech,</hi> and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf with the ſame chaines which are prepared for her, I ſhall have done for her all that the unhappineſs of my deſtiny permits me to do. Let us goe then, added he, let us goe to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> ſince it is as equally impoſſible for me, to abandon my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to loſe <hi>Alibech.</hi> This deſigne being ſtrongly imprinted in his heart, hee drew the Perſian aſide, and told him ſoftly, that as ſoon as night was come hee ſhould have ſatisfaction of him, and aſſured him beſides, that if he did not render <hi>Alibech</hi> to him, he would at leaſtwiſe goe along with him in his veſſell, and carry his anſwer himſelf to <hi>Arſalon.</hi> This man, being able to doe nothing elſe, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to wait the time he had appointed; in the mean ſpace <hi>Oſman</hi> ſent for one named <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a man of command, and one that you know hath courage and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and having told him that he was going the next night to try if hee could deliver his father, by meanes of an intelligence which hee had with <hi>Arſalons</hi> meſſenger, he willed him, if by misfortune his deſigne ſhould not ſucceed, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the fleer in his abſence, and not to fail in taking ſpeciall heed to <hi>Alibech,</hi> and to ſend her back to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in a veſſell; but not before hee had tarried ſome dayes in the view of <hi>Arſalons</hi> fleet; and whatſoever ſhould happen not to fight with him. This man, who was prudent, would faine have been a little better clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Oſmans</hi> deſigne; but whatſoever he could do, he could not oblige him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and <hi>Oſman</hi> making uſe of his abſolute power, hee could doe no other but obey. After this, <hi>Oſman</hi> went to <hi>Alibech,</hi> but whereas both of them had each their deſigne, although they had an hundred things to ſay to one another, out of the opinion wherein they were, that they ſhould never meet again, the deſire they had to execute their enterpriſe made them ſay little, fearing leſt their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation being too long, they ſhould not beguile one another, as they purpoſed to do.

After it was night, and that <hi>Oſman</hi> was gone out of his veſſell, he that was to ſerve <hi>Alibech</hi> came to her cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin at ſuch time as all her ſlaves were already aſleep; and by the favour of the darke he got her into the skiff, that was to carry them to his veſſell, as accordingly it did. He was no ſooner abord then, but he ſet ſail; and his Pilot getting clear of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60144:224"/> other veſſells as well as he could, ſteered directly to <hi>Arſalons</hi> Fleet. <hi>Oſman,</hi> on his ſide, being gotten abord of the Perſians Brigantine, had taken the ſame courſe; ſo that when the broad of day began to appear, and that <hi>Arſalon,</hi> wakened by his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and by the impatience hee was in for the return of him he had ſent, and was mounted on the deck, he ſaw two veſſells appear, one on the right hand, &amp; the other on the left, which as though they had had a purpoſe to advance equally, made with full ſailes towards the place where he was. He knew at firſt his Brigantine, but for the other, he could not apprehend who it was. <hi>Oſman</hi> on the other part, was not a little troubled to perceive, that the veſſell vvhich he ſavv vvas one of his; hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be it he beleeved that his dear <hi>Alibech</hi> hearing of his departure, had ſent ſome one of the Commanders of his Fleet after him to retain him; but he vvas much amazed, whenas theſe veſſells comming neer to one another, hee ſaw <hi>Alibech</hi> ſtanding on the deck. Whereupon he gave a great skreek, and litle lacked but through a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for which he could give no reaſon he had not caſt himſelf into the Sea to get to her. How unhappy am I cryed he! I parted from my fleet to ſave <hi>Alibech,</hi> and my departure alone delivers her into the hands of her father; and ſo I came not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt but to be a ſpectator of her puniſhment. But if <hi>Oſman</hi> was amazed, no leſs was <hi>Alibech;</hi> for ſome of her veſſell having known <hi>Oſman,</hi> and having told it to her, ſhe was infinitely afflicted, &amp; beleeved the ſame of <hi>Oſman</hi> which he had beleeved of her. In the mean time <hi>Arſalon,</hi> having ſent to diſcover this veſſell, was much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to underſtand, that <hi>Alibech</hi> came in that, and not in his Brigantine; which ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching aſwell as the other, made him ſee <hi>Oſman</hi> on the poop. Now albeit he could not comprehend that which he ſaw, yet was he glad to ſee more in his hands than he had hoped for; and cauſing the Baſſa of the Sea, laden with chaines, to mount upon the deck, Come ſaid he unto him, give your yrons to this Slave that betrayed me, and to this ingratefull daughter that abandoned me. The Baſſa diſcerning his Son, was extremely afflicted; and <hi>Oſman</hi> ſeeing his Father in that eſtate, was ſenſibly touched therewith. At length theſe two veſſels being come up to <hi>Arſalons,</hi> and <hi>Alibech</hi> &amp; <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being brought before him, Behold, ſaid he as they were approaching to him, theſe worthy objects of my hatred &amp; wrath, whom their treachery had drawn out of my power, and whom fortune hath reſtored unto me. We are rather an object of your pitty, anſwered <hi>Alibech,</hi> who was formoſt, &amp; fallen on her knee when ſhee came neer to <hi>Arſalon;</hi> but, continued ſhe, I came not hither to moove you to compaſſion; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that your wrath is equitable, &amp; your hatred juſt. And ſeeing I hold it impoſſible to reenter into your favor, I come to break his chaines who hath been in ſtead of a father to me, ever ſince I abandoned you; doe not think that <hi>Oſman</hi> hath conſented to that which I doe, it is a pure effect of mine own will. Alas! cryed <hi>Oſman</hi> then, beholding the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, pardon me dear father, if I could not reſolve to give my wife for to ſave you; but to teſtifie unto you, that I doe whatſoever I can, I am come hither to take your chaines upon me, and to obtain your liberty with the loſs of my life. Wherefore, ſaid he to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> deliver my Father, and put the chaines on me that he weares. I alone am faulty, and I alone am to be puniſhed; for as for <hi>Alibech,</hi> all her crime is nothing elſe but having compaſſion of others misfortunes, <hi>Arſalon,</hi> ſeeing two perſons ſo neer him, by whom he thought he had been much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, could not contain his former fury, and commanded that the Baſſa of the Sea ſhould be looſed, and his chaines divided betwixt <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech:</hi> but the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa beeing touched with the generoſity, both of <hi>Alibech</hi> and of <hi>Oſman,</hi> would not ſuffer himſelf to be ſet at liberty. I will not quit my yrons, ſaid he to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> to charge my children with them; for I beleeve, ſince you have no more feeling of a father for the vertuous <hi>Alibech,</hi> that I may be permitted to call her my daughter. Could you remember the time ſaid he to her, when I forbad you my houſe, and yet could you reſolve to give your liberty for a man, who once treated you as a ſlave? My Lord, anſwered ſhe, it well appeares by what hath arrived this day, that you had reaſon to be unwilling I ſhould be your ſons wife, ſince that fatall marriage is the cauſe of your unhappineſs. But, ſaid ſhe, turning her ſelf towards her father, if I dare put you in mind of that tenderneſſe which you have had for me, I humbly beſeech

What, ſaid <hi>Oſman</hi> unto her then, can you deſire that we ſhould be ſeparated? Yes, ſaid ſhe unto him, I can; for ſince we cannot live happy together, it is beſt that you ſhould injoy your liberty, and that I alone ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.

For that anſwered <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bech,</hi> as I am the cauſe of his misfortune, it is juſt I ſhould be ſo too of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſaid ſhe to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> conſult no further hereupon, <hi>Oſman</hi> loves me to that height, as he will never yeeld but by violence. And fear not, my Lord, ſaid ſhe unto him, to give him his liberty, you will puniſh him enough in puniſhing me; and the irons which I ſhall wear, will be more heavy to him without doubt than to me. <hi>Arſalon</hi> not able to forbear from being moved with ſo much generoſity, and <hi>Alibech</hi> having incountred his eyes, where ſhe ſaw (as ſhe thought) ſome marks of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, continued her diſcourſe, and redoubled her prayers. My Lord, ſaid ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, I believe that I my ſelf labour mine own ruin, and that confeſſing my ſelf guilty, without ſeeking excuſes for my crime, I render my ſelf unworthy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which I deſire of you: Wherefore, continued ſhe, permit me for the leſſening of my fault to put you in remembrance of that bleſſed time, when as the Pirate <hi>Arſalon</hi> was a Satrape of <hi>Perſia;</hi> you know, my Lord, that my Mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned her Parents to follow you, and that then you called that exceſs of love and generoſity in her, which now you term an horrible crime in me. It is true, that I have followed <hi>Oſman,</hi> but it was not as a ſlave, it was as my husband; and let heaven be my witneſs, whether in abandoning you, I do not quit a part of my ſelf; and whether I have not ever ſince made vowes for your preſervation. This mighty Fleet which is ready to ſet upon me (ſaid <hi>Arſalon</hi> to her, who yet did not yeeld) is without doubt an effect of your prayers and affection. Alas! anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Alibech,</hi> if <hi>Oſman</hi> would have fought with you, he would not have come and put himſelf into your hands without Arms. Conſider then, my Lord, if there be any ſenſe of pity reſting in you, whether you can with juſtice reſolve the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a man, who ſeeing his father in captivity, hath notwithſtanding had that reſpect for you, as not to fight with you becauſe you were mine; you ſee too that he is not an unnaturall ſonne, ſince he comes himſelf to offer you his liberty and his life to deliver his father. I conjure you then by the memory of the onely perſon of the world whom you have moſt dearly loved, and who gave me life, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount your reſentment in this occaſion; and to vanquiſh us in generoſity; you may do it my Lord, if you will, and a greater cannot be than to vanquiſh ones ſelf. If you regard us as your children, you will eaſily pardon us; and if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider us as your enemies, we are ſo wretched, and ſo abſolutely depending on you, that compaſſion will be of more power in your ſoul, than the deſire of revenge, it being moſt certain that a generous ſpirit cannot reſolve to oppreſs the feeble.

What <hi>Arſalon!</hi> cried the Baſſa of the ſea then, ſhall not the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this woman, which would move a Barbarian, move a father? What my Lord! added <hi>Oſman,</hi> cannot <hi>Alibechs</hi> tears obtain her and my fathers liberty? at leaſtwiſe yet let the loſs of my life oblige you unto it. During this diſcourſe, and this noble diſpute, where the prize of the victory was the loſs of liberty, <hi>Arſalon</hi> had his mind filled with divers thoughts; the deſire of revenge, and a will to pardon, agitated his ſoul; but in the end, whereas reaſon and nature were both of a ſide, he began to be moved. He could no longer behold his daughter, but with tears in his eyes; and both <hi>Oſmans</hi> and his fathers generoſity poſſeſſing him with confuſion, whereas naturally he loved glory, and was not cruell, but out of an habit and deſpair, he ſuddenly changed his thoughts, and embracing his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with tenderneſs, I am overcome, ſaid he unto her, thy vertue is ſtronger than my cruelty. This happy change begot ſhouts of joy, not only from the Baſſa, not onely from <hi>Alibech,</hi> not onely from <hi>Oſman,</hi> but from all thoſe of the veſſell. In the mean time <hi>Oſman</hi> caſting himſelf at the feet of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> My Lord, ſayd he unto him, load me with Irons, and joyn together all the torments which ever have been invented, I ſhall give you thankes in enduring them. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi> hearing him ſpeak thus, lifted him up very kindly, and unlooſing the Baſſa of the Sea himſelf, I ſhould not have done a grace to <hi>Alibech,</hi> ſayd he unto him, if I had not done it to you too, ſince your life is hers.

After this, my Lord, they went to the Fleet, where was ſo univerſall a rejoycing, as the like hath never been heard ſpoken of. In the mean while, whereas a part of the Gallies and Veſſels had been bruiſed with the tempeſt, we made to land, that we might put them in a condition to follow the firſt deſign. And it was there, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> where we learned that your Victory had no need of our ſuccour. This good news being made known to <hi>Arſalon,</hi> who had been acquainted by <hi>Alibech</hi> with the obligation wherein ſhe was engaged unto you, he deſired the Baſſa of the ſea to obtain of you, that if any treaty of peace were to be made between the Sultan and the Sophy, you would be pleaſed to take the care of making his, and getting him the liberty to go and end his dayes in his country, from whence love in times paſt had baniſhed him. I deſire this grace of you then on the behalf of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> of the Baſſa of the ſea, of <hi>Oſman,</hi> and of the vertuous <hi>Alibech,</hi> who beſeeches you that you will be her protection yet a ſecond time. <hi>Morath</hi> having given over ſpeaking, left <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> and <hi>Ulama</hi> ſo raviſhed with his relation, and the generoſity of <hi>Alibech,</hi> as they thought they ſhould never have done praiſing her. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> promiſed <hi>Morath</hi> to re-eſtabliſh <hi>Arſalon;</hi> and having ſent him back again the next day, becauſe he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them that he ſhould find them ſtil abiding in the Port, where he had left them, he commanded him to bring <hi>Arſalon</hi> to him with as much ſpeed as poſſibly he could, and to aſſure all thoſe generous perſons, that he ſhould never be contented,

After this, ſhe made them paſs, though they were unwilling to it, into a great room, where ſhe had cauſed all the Sophyes riches, and treaſure, to be laid; to the end that by the ſight of ſo tempting an object, their hearts might be overcome with the deſire of making themſelves maſters of it. They proved notwithſtanding more generous than ſhe imagined; for although they teſtified a great deal of acknowledgement to her for her liberality, yet would they not accept of it. In the mean time they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to let no body go out of the Citty, which might acquaint the enemy with the death of <hi>Tachmas;</hi> for being ſo powerfull as he was, it might give him a minde to come and aſſault them in <hi>Sultania,</hi> which otherwiſe it may bee hee would not doe. During all theſe things, every one had their deſignes; <hi>Perca</hi> thought of nothing but of making <hi>Iſmael</hi> to be hated; the friends of <hi>Mahamed, Axiamira,</hi> and <hi>Vlama,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with impatience the troopes which were to come unto them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Provinces, to the end they might doe that which they thought would bee moſt requiſite; <hi>Iſmael</hi> ſought how he might free himſelf from the care of affaires. Things having continued ſome time in this ſort, it hapned in the end that the ſame facility, which ſhe had ſo much liked in <hi>Iſmaels</hi> diſpoſition, gave her a great deal of unquietneſs, for even i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the like manner as ſhe had made her ſelf miſtreſs of it, ſo did others: he was no ſooner out of his ſight, but this Prince altered his mind according to the humor of thoſe that talked with him; and whereas every one was enemy to <hi>Perca,</hi> as often as ſhe returned to him, ſhe found him changed; and thought it was not difficult for her to bring him to her bow again, yet ſhee feared that at ſome time or other uſe would be made of his name to undoe her. They, unto whom <hi>Iſmael</hi> had told that <hi>Vlama</hi> had ſaved his life, having reported it to others, all the people came to know it, and began to murmure far more than before. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in ſuch like occaſions a weak beginning hath many times great and long conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; <hi>Perca</hi> going about to puniſh one of <hi>Ulamaes</hi> antient domeſticall ſervants, for ſomething he had ſaid againſt her, the people mutined in ſuch ſort, as they went and beſieged her in her Palace. The ſervants of <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>Axiamira</hi> began then to diſcover their true intents, in not oppoſing aſmuch as they might the fury of his incenſed people, who began to cry in the ſtreets, let the cruell <hi>Perca</hi> dye, and long live <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>Axiamira.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Perca,</hi> finding her ſelf in ſo great a danger, would have made uſe of <hi>Iſmael</hi> to reduce this multitude to their duty, by obliging him to take up armes and ſhew himſelf to the people. But <hi>Iſmael</hi> who naturally was cowardly and fearefull, ſeeing the danger neer, little compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny about him, and hearing from the chamber where he was that horrible noyſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60144:226"/> which alwaies accompanies ſedition, anſwered her trembling, that for his part, hee had rather yield the Crown to <hi>Mahamed,</hi> than to expoſe himſelf to the loſs of his life. Ah baſe coward, cryed this ambitious Princeſs, whoſoever is capable of yielding up a Crown, is not worthy to live! In the mean ſeaſon, the firſt gates of the Palace were forced, there wanted no more but breaking up the reſt for to get in, they which garded them having abandoned them. In this dreadfull eſtate, <hi>Perca</hi> taking a dagger, which had been brought to <hi>Iſmael</hi> out of a beleef that he would have armed himſelf, and ſeeing that ſhe could not avoyd falling into the power of a people filled with fury, did yet what ſhe could to get him to ſhew himſelf. Shee joyned threatnings to intreaties, and perceiving at laſt that all which ſhee ſaid was in vain, &amp; that in an inſtant ſhe ſhould no longer be miſtreſs of her ſelf, rage ſo ſeized on her ſoul, as preſenting the dagger unto him with an extreme tranſport; Chuſe, ſaid ſhe unto him, either to pierce my heart, or to doe what I would have you. And when as <hi>Iſmael</hi> had told her, that he would not doe either the one or the other, and that ſhe heard a great noyſe, whereby ſhe knew that the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe conſpirators being entred into the Palace, and having learned from ſome of the Princeſs vvomen the cauſe of <hi>Iſmaels</hi> death, and likevviſe that of <hi>Perca,</hi> they redoubled their cryes, and teſtified aſmuch joy, as if all their enemies had been defeated. In the mean time the wiſeſt and the moſt conſiderable of <hi>Sultania</hi> had begun to oppoſe the people, although they loved not <hi>Perca;</hi> but comming to underſtand the ſucceſs of the buſineſs, they held it not fit to incenſe them, but rather in ſo ſtrange an accident to make uſe of their zeal in favor of <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>Axiamira.</hi> After then that they had let them know, how there was no further need of taking up armes, ſince the object of their hate was no longer in an eſtate to hurt them; after that for the calming of their fury, they had removed the bodies of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Perca</hi> out of the way; and after that they had promiſed ſpeedily to ſettle a peace for them, and call home their exiled Princes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one retyred to his own houſe: and the Councell being ſet, it was adviſed, that it was no time any longer to defer the propounding of a peace; becauſe if the newes of this ſtrange accident ſhould be ſpread over the Provinces, it might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with a pretext to revolt, and work the utter ſubverſion of this Empire; and that in fine, it was better to yeeld ſomething unto the enemy, than to put in hazard the loſing of all. After this, they choſe the moſt underſtanding amongſt them to bee ſent as Deputies to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> with an abſolute power to treat of all things. The grand Viſior, as I have ſaid, having received them in the preſence of <hi>Vlama,</hi> and they having acquainted him with this horrible adventure, he that ſpake for all the reſt, added further, that knowing his generoſity they came to propound a peace unto him, upon reaſonable conditions; and to demand Prince <hi>Mahamed,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and <hi>Vlama</hi> of him, for the reſtoring of them to the ranck which they ought to hold. That if ſo be <hi>Soliman</hi> was their protector, hee was to teſtifie it in this occaſion; that to draw an unjuſt advantage from theſe illuſtrious perſons being in his power, would bee the violating of the Law of Nations, and naturall equity, ſince they were there as thoſe that fled to him for refuge, and not as priſoners; but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the glory of vanquiſhing, and reſtoring of thoſe to the Sophies Throne, which might lawfully pretend unto it, was to do a brave and famous action; that there were more examples found of ſuch as had conquered Empires, than of ſuch as had rendred up Kingdoms; and that there were more which knew how to vanquiſh their Enemies, than ſurmount their own ambition. After that this man had ſaid all that he believed was capable to advance the buſineſs which he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> anſwered him, that being thoroughly informed of all the Sultans intentions, and having power to reſolve on any thing without receiving new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60144:227"/> he could aſſure them that they ſhould have cauſe to commend him; that his grief was, he could not keep <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>Axiamira</hi> from receiving this peace with tears, ſince they had ſo lamentable an occaſion for it; but whereas this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair directly concerned them, they were to treat with them about it; that in the mean time he held it requiſite, that one of them ſhould return to <hi>Sultania,</hi> to aſſure the people that ere long they ſhould ſee their lawfull Princes again; and that the reſt ſhould go to <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> to do their duty to <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>Axiamira;</hi> that to comfort them for the grief which ſo dolefull an accident would bring them, <hi>Ula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> ſhould take the pains both to conduct them thither, and alſo to accompany the Prince, Princeſs, and <hi>Felixana</hi> back when they returned. <hi>Ulama</hi> perceiving that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in turning himſelf towards him, ſeemed to demand his conſent for that which he had ſpoken, aſſured him that he was very ready to do it. And whereas he was generous, I doubt not, ſaid he, but the Prince and <hi>Axiamira</hi> will be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touched with this loſs, ſince I that am not obliged thereunto by ſo ſtrict bonds, and that have ſeen my ſelf the object of the hatred and perſecution of thoſe whom I bewail, cannot chooſe but be grieved at the accident which is befallen them. After that <hi>Ulama</hi> had given ſufficient proof of his generoſity by his ſorrow, and that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had commended him for ſo noble a reſentment, he gave him commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to take care of the Deputies of <hi>Sultania</hi> till the next day, when he thought it fit they ſhould depart for to go and fetch <hi>Mahamed,</hi> which accordingly was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. <hi>Ulama</hi> parted with thoſe that were to accompany him, carrying Letters from <hi>Ibrahtm</hi> to the Princeſs; one of the Deputies went to <hi>Sultania,</hi> and the Grand Viſier remained with a joy that cannot be expreſt; for whereas he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the beginning of his felicity depended on the happy end of this war, ſeeing the favourable means which fortune preſented him with to terminate it ſpeedily and with glory, he could not render thanks enough to heaven for ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious a ſucceſs. And whereas he knew that the people generally deſired peace, he was aſſured that the treaty of it would be agreeable to every body; not knowing that <hi>Soliman</hi> had any other intereſt in this war, than that of the glory of his Arms. In this thought it might be ſaid, that never any Lover abſent from his Miſtreſs was ſo happy as he, whilſt he entertained himſelf with ſo ſweet a hope. In the mean time <hi>Ulama</hi> arrived at <hi>Bitiliſa,</hi> preſented the Deputies to Prince <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> and delivering <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s letter to her, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the loſs they had ſuſtained, they being generous inſtantly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all the perſecutions they had ſuffered, and no longer remembred ought but that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was their father, <hi>Iſmael</hi> was their brother, and <hi>Perca</hi> their ſiſter; in the thought whereof they were extremely afflicted with their loſs. But at length, <hi>Ulama</hi> having imparted to them the generous deſigns of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their preſence was to their people for their conſolation againſt ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they had indured, they ſet forth on their way. As for <hi>Ulama,</hi> the ſight of his dear <hi>Felixana</hi> comforted him for the loſs of his enemies, and the Princes and Princeſſes ſorrow was to both of them their greateſt diſpleaſure. In the end after they had travelled with as much ſpeed as the accommodation of <hi>Axiamira</hi> would permit, they arrived at <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Camp; who underſtanding that they were at hand went to receive them with three thouſand of his own quarter; and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the more reſpect unto them he appeared that day in mourning, and ſaid ſo many generous and obliging things unto them, as they were conſtrained to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that if fortune had done him right, he ſhould have been King of all the world. When as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had conducted them to their Tents, which he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be prepared for them with a great deal of magnificence, and had treated <hi>Mahamed,</hi> as being Sophy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he ſaid unto him, that he was happy amidſt his unhappineſs, in beginning his reign with the end of the war, and in being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make the firſt declaration, which he ſhould publiſh to his people, be a Treaty of peace; but that he might not defer this pleaſure to them, and this glory to himſelf, it behoved him to propound ſuch a one as he would have. It is not for the vanquiſhed, ſaid <hi>Mahamed,</hi> to impoſe a Law on the vanquiſhers, but onely for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60144:227"/> them to receive it. He that knowes to uſe a victory ſo well, ſaid <hi>Axiamira</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, as to ſpeak in this ſort to them which ow their lives and libertie to him, ought alone to make it ſuch as he pleaſeth, ſince it is certain that he can doe nothing that is unjuſt. After that theſe illuſtrious perſons had rendred all the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to one another which their generoſity obliged them unto, they fell to accord upon the Articles of this peace, which were ſo advantageous for the two Empires, and ſo glorious for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as the people and the ſouldiers, who will meddle with judging of all things without knowledge, and out of intereſt, could finde nothing to murmure at. This Treaty, having been ſigned by <hi>Axiamira,</hi> for the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Mahameds</hi> defect, was alſo ſigned by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> by <hi>Ulama,</hi> by the Deputies of <hi>Sultania,</hi> and by the chiefeſt of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Army. After this, <hi>Mahamed,</hi> who had alwayes loved <hi>Axiamira</hi> exceedingly, deſired her that ſhe would ſhare in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and having requeſted her that ſhe would be his guide, ſhe promiſed him, that as ſhe had never had a deſign to marry, ſo ſhe would neither think of it, nor aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him. And in this manner ſhe ſatisfied that which ſhe owed to her own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that which <hi>Mahamed</hi> deſired of her, and that which the memory of Prince <hi>Gianger</hi> required of her generoſity. <hi>Mahamed</hi> then asked of <hi>Ulama,</hi> whether he would not injoy the felicity of his reign? And think not, ſaid he unto him, that ſucceeding to the Sophy, I will ſucceed to his paſſions; I ſhall be your Prince, and your Friend, but I ſhall never be your Rivall. <hi>Ulama</hi> anſwered to this diſcourſe with a great deal of generoſity; and whereas the love to ones Countrey is ſtrong enough in every mans ſoul; and whereas there was a very ſtraght union between all theſe illuſtrious perſons; though <hi>Ulama</hi> was exceedingly obliged to the Sultan, and that he loved <hi>Ibrahim</hi> as much as himſelf, yet he reſolved to abandon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector for to follow his lawfull Prince. Things being in this eſtate, <hi>Arſalon</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved luckily for himſelf, accompanied with <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech;</hi> and whereas <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was preſently advertiſed thereof, he went and received them, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them to <hi>Axiamiraes</hi> Tent, where <hi>Mahamed</hi> was: and after he had recounted unto them the hiſtory of <hi>Arſalon,</hi> whereof the beginning was not unknown to them; after he had commended the generoſity of <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech,</hi> and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the violence of her father, he obtained this grace of the new Sophy, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his word to him to reſtore him to his former dignity. In the mean time the Articles of the Peace had been publiſhed, both in the Army, and in <hi>Sultania,</hi> with great ſigns of rejoycing on either ſide; and the hour of ſeparation being come, the Sophy ſaid to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that owing his Life, his Liberty, and the Crown which he was going to wear, unto him, he felt himſelf obliged to tell him, that he ſhould alwayes finde him ready to hazzard them for his ſervice: In fine, ſaid he unto him, generous <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> I ow unto you not onely that which you have done for me, not onely the good which my Empire receives from you, but alſo that which you have done for the Princeſs <hi>Axiamira,</hi> for <hi>Felixana,</hi> and for <hi>Ulama.</hi> Judge after this, if without being ingratefull I can be meanly acknowledging. And I profeſs unto you, added he, in taking his laſt farewell of him, that the moſt ſenſible ſorrow which ever my blindneſs gave me, is that which I now feel, for that I cannot ſee my Protector. <hi>Jbrahim</hi> going to anſwer him, was hindred from it by <hi>Axiamira;</hi> Defend not your ſelf, ſaid ſhe unto him, with an unjuſt modeſty, and permit, that now at parting, we may teſtifie unto you, how not finding means to oblige you, we are not unworthy to be obliged, ſince we know how to prize your vertue, and eſteem of the rare qualities that are in you. And for my particular, added ſhe, I hold <hi>Soliman</hi> to be greater, more mighty, and more happy in having you for his Subject, than in being Maſter of ſo great a number of Provinces, which make him to be redoubted over all the earth. You ſo confound me, Madam, anſwered <hi>Jbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> with an high reſpect, as I cannot anſwer you; but know, ſaid he, that into what part of the world ſoever fortune carries me, you ſhall ever have of me a faithfull and paſſionate ſervant. If one might be a Subject out of choice, you would have too many, ſaid he unto them, your vertue would make deſerts of all
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60144:228"/> your Neighbours Kingdoms; and this conqueſt would be ſo much the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to you, for that it would not extend to any but to reaſonable perſons; for that you would have none but illuſtrious ſubjects; and for that without arms you would diſarm all your Enemies. After many other civilities, <hi>Mahamed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted alone into a Chariot, and <hi>Axiamira</hi> into another with her dear <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixana,</hi> who in her particular had rendred thanks unto <hi>Ibrahim</hi> for all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her life; <hi>Ulama</hi> ſtayed yet a little while with him; and though they ſayd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet left they not teſtifying the extreme affection which they bore to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſince maugre the intereſts which were to ſeparate them, they felt a world of grief. <hi>Arſalon</hi> in like manner thanked <hi>Ibrahim</hi> for the grace he had obtained for him, and for that which he had formerly done to <hi>Alibech;</hi> who ſeeing her father part could not forbear ſhedding of tears; <hi>Oſman</hi> did the like; and the Grand Vifier having promiſed <hi>Arſalon</hi> to take care of them, and to protect them as much as he could, this generous Pirate comforting his daughter, told her, that owing more to her husband than to him, it was juſt that ſhe ſhould follow his fortune; and that ſhe had done enough in getting him the honour and liberty to go &amp; die in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to make it appear ſhe had quitted her ſelf towards him for the life he had given her. At laſt all theſe generous perſons being ſeparated, <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Alibech</hi> began their journey, and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having given them a Convoy to ſecure them from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of disbanded Souldiers, which they ſhould happen to meet with, thought of nothing but of withdrawing his troups out of the enemyes country; to the end that being upon the frontire, he might quit the Army, and go to carry the news himſelf of his Victory, and of the Peace to <hi>Solimon.</hi> He diſcamped then the next day with a great deal of order and diligence; howbeit he had the ſatisfaction before his going out of <hi>Perſia</hi> to underſtand, that <hi>Mahamed</hi> had been received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throne of his Fathers with joy; that <hi>Ulama</hi> had maried <hi>Felixana;</hi> that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi> was received to his dignity; and that after ſo many misfortunes thoſe Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious perſons vvere happy: For <hi>Mahamed</hi> and <hi>Axiamira</hi> took care to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him of it, in ſending him ſo magnificent a Preſent, as there was no King in the world but it was worthy of. <hi>Axiamira</hi> wrote alſo to <hi>Soliman</hi> in the name of the Sophy and of her ſelf, wherein with a great deal of addreſs ſhe found the means to make the Illuſtrious Baſſaes Elogium. In the mean time he advanced as much as he could, and they were no ſooner in <hi>Solimans</hi> Territories, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the conduct of them to the Baſſa <hi>Piali;</hi> and after he had ſent one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants certain daies before hand to <hi>Pera,</hi> he took the ſame way, followed by ſome of the Commanders: and wholly filled with hope, love, and joy, he arrived there when as it was ſo late in the night, as the Port vvas ſhut, and the Guards ſet; ſo that how impatient ſoever he was to ſee <hi>Iſabella,</hi> he was conſtrained to attend till the next morning, being unwilling for this time to make uſe of the privilege which he had.</p>

               <p>THe Illuſtrious Baſſa having paſt the whole night without ſleeping, ſo much had the hope of ſeeing <hi>Iſabella</hi> pleaſingly entertained him, ſent as ſoon as the Sun appeared to know whether <hi>Soliman</hi> would be pleaſed that he ſhould come wait upon him, and render him an account of his voyage. The Sultan ſurpriſed with a thing which he had not much apprehended, in regard he thought it not ſo near, gave not his anſwer ſo ſpeedily. He marvelled at the grand Viſiers return, conſidering the order which he had ſent him, not to come back before he heard from him, what proſperous ſucceſs ſoever he ſhould happen to have; but in fine, it being no longer time to reaſon on things paſt, and being conſtrained to anſwer preciſely to that which was demanded of him, his mind was in a great diſorder. The name of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> vvho vvas ſo near, poſſeſſed him with ſome remorſe of his fault, but the thought then of loſing the Princeſs, made him inſtantly repent him of ſo good a motion, and wiſh never to ſee <hi>Ibrahim</hi> more, that he might ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whom he had not ſeen ſince that cruell inſtant, wherein out of his fear of the Baſſaes return he had joyned threatnings to entreaties, and given her but only eight dayes time to reſolve once for all, whereof ſix were already paſt when as the Baſſa came back to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and he had been three moneths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without any news at all of him, ſo exactly had the reſolution which he had taken for it been executed. But in fine, how violent ſoever <hi>Solimans</hi> love was, yet could he not reſolve to ſee <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and keep <hi>Iſabella</hi> from him: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had alwaies a ſtrong diſpoſition in his heart to good, and ſome thoughts of friendſhip for the Grand Viſier, the ſhame of his crime, the ſmall hope he had of vanquiſhing <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and the ſhort time he had to reſolve in, made him ſend <hi>Ibrahim</hi> word that he might come preſently; and that at his arrivall he ſhould find <hi>Iſabella</hi> at his Palace, whither he was going to return her: This Prince cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would never have yeelded to this, had he had any hope left of gaining the Princeſſes heart; but ſince the day that he had laſt ſpoken with her, and that he had taken great care to have her narrowly obſerved, he had learnt, that ſhe was in ſo great an affliction, as he was afraid the extremity of her grief would kill her: So that conſidering he ſhould commit a crime to no purpoſe, if he ſhould retain <hi>Jſabella,</hi> he was the more eaſily induced to let her go forth of the Seraglio. In this thought he would not ſee her, but ſent for the Sultana <hi>Aſteria,</hi> vvho vvas no ſooner come to him, but he commanded her to go and tell <hi>Jſabella,</hi> that <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> was returned, and that out of an exceſs of bounty he permitted her to go out of the Seraglio; but that ſhe ſhould beware of acquainting the Grand Viſier with ought that he had ſaid unto her, becauſe an extreme-miſchief might thereby ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive both to him, and to her. <hi>Aſteria</hi> went and executed her commiſſion with a great deal of pleaſure; for albeit ſhe loved <hi>Iſabella</hi> very dearly, yet the deſire of her conſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60144:229"/> imployed to her, came and told her from him, that in going out of the Seraglio ſhe did not goe out of his power, and that he would not fail to ſend to know her reſolution; that nevertheleſs he would to favor her give her yet eight dayes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for it. For as if the Prince had undertaken to be his own enemy, and to puniſh his own fault, he ſcarcely formed a deſigne but he ſtraightway deſtroyed it; ſo that he had no ſooner let <hi>Iſabella</hi> know that ſhe ſhould goe out of the Seraglio, but he ſeemed to repent it, and ſent that ſlave, <hi>Roxelanaes</hi> confident, with that meſſage to her: and ſhe was no ſooner gon, but his love, and the deſire of ſeeing her augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; nevertheleſs in regard the thing was done, and that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was ſuddenly to arrive, he changed not his order. In the mean time the grand Viſier, having made no doubt but that he ſhould eaſily obtain the permiſſion which he had deſired of <hi>Soliman,</hi> cauſed a ſtately Galliot, which he knew was in the Arſenal at <hi>Pera,</hi> to be launched into the water; and it was for this purpoſe that hee had ſent one of his ſervants certain dayes before, to the end he ſhould give order ſecretly for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it in a readineſs againſt he came. As ſoon then as he underſtood the Sultans pleaſure hee imbarqued himſelf, attended by all the Commanders which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him: and truely there was never a more magnificent or more agreeable object ſeen than this Galliot, eſpecially when <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was abord it. All that was looked upon was painted and gilt; the whole Poop was hung with Perſian Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, whoſe ground was gold; it was covered all over with flaggs and ſtreamers of divers colours; all the ſlaves that rowed were faſtned with ſilver chaines, and all of them had garments of cloth of gold; twelve Trumpeters were on the Courſey cloathed in velvet, whoſe ground was gold; all the Commanders apparell vvas imbroidered vvith pearles and diamonds; and in the midſt of this ſtately troup ſtood <hi>Ibrahim</hi> alone, though he had ſix great cuſhions of cloth of gold at his feet; He held in his hand a battoun of command, and was ſo ſuperbly apparelled, as it was eaſie to perceive that this petty triumph was an effect of peace, ſince riches and abundance were every where ſeen, and very few marks of war. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had that day on a robe of cloth of ſilver, imbroidered with gold and diamonds, intermixed with certain carnation ſilk twiſt, which added very much to the beauty of that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; His turbant was covered all over with carnation and white plumes of feathers, ſet up with jewels of diamonds of an ineſtimable value; His Scymitar, and the golden chaines whereunto it was faſtned, were anſwerable to the gorgeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his garment: now although ſilk, ſilver, gold, pearl, and diamonds richly appeared there, yet might it be ſaid with truth, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> gave rather a new luſter to all thoſe things, than that he recived any from them. His ſhape was goodly, well made, and advantageous; his cariage free and noble; his face ovall; his eyes black, and full of fire and ſweetneſs; his mouth agreeable; his complexion neither too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, nor too groſs, neither too pale, nor too red; but ſuch as <hi>Mars</hi> is painted, when as he is amorouſly repreſented unto us; His hayr was of cheſnut color; and his noſe ſomwhat aquilin, yet ſo as it ſerved to give him the better aſpect; His phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy was promiſing and ſprightfull; his ſoul was ſeen in his eyes, his courage and his affabilitie appeared equally in them; and without having ought of the beauty of a woman, he was the goodlieſt man that ever was beheld. In fine there was ſeen in his whole perſon, a lofty ayr without pride, a gallanterie without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, a neglectfull handſomneſs, a freeneſs without artifice, a civility without conſtraint, and ſomthing ſo great and ſo high therein, as one could not behold him without judging him worthy to wear a crown. All theſe naturall graces had a new luſtre the day wherein <hi>Ibrahim</hi> entred into <hi>Conſtantineople,</hi> and the hope of ſeeing <hi>Iſabella</hi> had painted ſuch a joy in his face, as gave him a certain extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs. This petty triumph was not without ſpectators; for <hi>Ibrahims</hi> return being known, whereas he was univerſally beloved, all the Grandees of the Port, and all the people of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> repaired to the Haven, and by the ſhouts which they gave as ſoon as the Galliot approached, they teſtifyed their zeal and affection to him. <hi>Soliman,</hi> more provoked than by the agitation of his ſoul, and by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60144:229"/> without reaſon, than by the good will which he bore to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> had alſo placed himſelf upon a Terrace with a Balluſtrade of Jaſper, vvhich lookes to the Sea on that ſide; and vvhen every one ſtill continued their ſhouts of joy, Muſt all theſe people, ſayd hee to himſelf, reproach mee vvith my fault; muſt the ſight of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> cauſe more joy in them than in me? and muſt he be more beloved of them than of me, who am obliged thereunto by ſo many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Yes, ſaid he, Love and <hi>Iſabella</hi> will have it ſo, and I cannot hinder it. But at length <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Galliot being come ſo near, as it permitted him to diſcern <hi>Soliman,</hi> who was leaning on the Baluſtrade, he ſaluted him with a profound reſpect, and being landed, all the people redoubled their ſhouts. The moſt conſiderable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to ſalute him, and they that could not do ſo, did at the leaſt what they could to be ſeen of him. After that this multitude had ſufficiently conſidered him, whom they acknowledged for their Protector, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> followed by all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Grandees, and all the people, went to the Seraglio, where he entred alone; for <hi>Soliman</hi> feeling the diſorder of his ſoul, vvould not give him any but a private audience. When as he was come into the Sultans chamber, <hi>Soliman</hi> could not chuſe but be ſomewhat glad, yet was he poſſeſſed with confuſion at the very ſame inſtant, and received not the Baſſa with that freeneſs, wherewith he was wont to teſtifie the affection which he bore him. Before time, he would rather have ſpoken to him of the grief his abſence had been the cauſe of to him; of the fear he was in for him; of the health of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and of the joy he had for his return; than of affairs of State: but in this encounter, he would needs have him at the very firſt render him an accompt of the War; and although he had reſolved to give <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> no marks of the diſorder of his ſoul, yet could he not forbear it. In the midſt of his relation he asked of him, whether he had not received a new order which he had ſent him? And when as <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had aſſured him that he had not, he ſeemed to be vexed at it, without telling him what it was: And at ſuch time as the Grand Viſier had informed him, how advantageous the peace which he had made in <hi>Perſia</hi> was for him, he could not chuſe but tell him things, which might make him judge, that he would have been glad he had not terminated the War as yet. Howbeit <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſuſpected nothing elſe of it, but that during his abſence <hi>Roxlana</hi> and <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had perſwaded him from making a Peace ſo ſoon. This thought gave him ſome unquietneſs, nevertheleſs it preſently diminiſhed; for <hi>Soliman</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what he had done, diſguiſed his mind a little better; and out of a ſenſe of jealouſie, he began to careſs <hi>Ibrahim</hi> more, to the end that retaining him the longer w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But at length <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who did not penetrate into the truth of things, ſeeing that the Sultan ſtill retained him, and that he had no ſooner anſwered to one queſtion, but ſtraightway he asked him another; My Lord, ſayd he unto him (with the ſame freedom wherewith he was uſed to talk to him) wil thy highneſs be pleaſed to permit me, now that I have given an account of my voyage to my Maſter, that I may go and do my duty to my Miſtris. <hi>Soliman</hi> bluſht at this diſcourſe, and deſiring to conceal his confuſion from the Baſſa, he diſmiſſed him ſooner than otherwiſe he would have done; and remained in ſo extraordinary an unquietneſs, as he thought twenty times to call back <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim,</hi> to ſend and ſeiſe upon <hi>Iſabella,</hi> to ſecure himſelf of the one, to cauſe the other to be brought into the Seraglio again, and in the end to proceed to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A little beam of light, and a great deal of confuſion, kept him never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs from executing his bad deſigns; and his ſoul was never ſo reſolved for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, as that he could do it without repugnancy. In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> went to his Palace, where he was expected with a great deal of impatience; but he was exceedingly ſurpriſed, when as he found, <hi>Doria, Horatio, Alphonſo,</hi> and the French Marquis waiting for him in the Fore-Court. At firſt he doubted of the report of his eyes, yea and was a good while hearing his friends talk, before he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60144:230"/> could abſolutely beleeve that which he ſaw to be true. He embraced them all with as much tranſport of joy, as he had affection for them; for all thoſe that had followed him, had out of reſpect and by his commandment left him at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into his Palace. But above all the reſt he could not chuſe but behold <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> with amazement, and ask of him whether it were true indeed that it was he? As they were ſtanding there, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> chancing to caſt up his eyes was yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, when as he eſpyed on the foot-pace of the Balluſtrade that divided his Court, <hi>Iſabella</hi> comming towards him; accompanied with <hi>Sophronia, Hipolita, Emilia,</hi> and <hi>Leonida.</hi> What inchantment, cryed he in advancing towards <hi>Iſabella,</hi> makes me ſee ſo many wonders together? am I at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or at <hi>Genoua?</hi> and may I beleeve what I ſee? You are ſtill in a place, ſayd <hi>Iſabella,</hi> where you have been extremely wiſhed for, and where vows have been made for your return. You ſee, Madam, ſaid he unto her, in kiſſing her hand which ſhe had given him, that they have not been in vain, ſince I can aſſure you, that my voyage hath been proſperous, and that I am ſtill abſolutely yours. After this, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſaluted theſe four beautifull companions of the infortunate <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who each of them in their particular made him a complement; and then <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having lent the Princeſs his hand, this fair troop entred into the Palace, and went to <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> chamber. It was there where theſe illuſtrious friends teſtified the true thoughts which they had for one another; <hi>Ibrahim</hi> nevertheleſs marvelled to ſee fewer marks of joy in <hi>Iſabellaes</hi> face, than in that of all the reſt, which had not ſo much intereſt in his perſon: Notwithſtanding whereas he ſaw that her complexion was a little pale, he believed that it was an effect of ſome ſickneſs which ſhe had had; and in this thought he went on in entertaining his friends with liberty enough of ſpirit. He underſtood confuſedly, and in few words, that which had brought them to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but not without grief was he acquainted with the Count of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagnaes</hi> and <hi>Leonoraes</hi> deplorable death. You ſee, ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> to him then ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is never any joy ſo pure for us, but it is mixed with ſome bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. She ſaid this in ſuch a faſhion, as gave him cauſe to think that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had ſome thing which was diſpleaſing in her minde; ſo that he reſolved as ſoon as in civility he could ſpeak to her without being heard, not to loſe the occaſion for it, which inſtantly preſented it ſelf. For all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were too intelligent, and knew too well how to love, to be ignorant, that after a long abſence it would have been ſome inhumanity to keep two hearts that loved one another ſo perfectly, from communicating their thoughts in private; ſo that preſently after they were riſen from meat, ſome went into the Cabinet, ſome into the Gallery, and <hi>Aemilia</hi> alone remained in a corner of the chamber with the French Marquis. In the mean time <hi>Iſabella</hi> was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unquietneſs, the remembrance of what <hi>Soliman</hi> had ſaid to her poſſeſſed all her ſoul, and the incertainty wherein ſhe was, whether ſhe ſhould impart it to <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> or whether ſhe ſhould not ſpeak to him of it, put her minde upon the wrack. What ſhall I doe, ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, in ſo croſs an incounter? If I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the truth of that which hath befallen me from him, I treſpaſs againſt our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and it may be put his life and my honor in jeopardy: But if I tell it to him, continued ſhe, and he cannot forbear teſtifying ſomewhat of it, when as the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath injoyned me not to ſpeak of it, we are undone, and nothing can ſave us. If I ſtay too, added ſhe, till <hi>Soliman</hi> ſends to me for the anſwer, which he will have me give him within eight days, what ſhall I doe then? and what ſhall I ſay to <hi>Jbrahim?</hi> And if I come to the point to be conſtrained to acquaint him with his unhappineſs and mine, what may he think of my ſilence? and what lawfull excuſe can I make to him for it? But if it ſhould happen too, that <hi>Soliman</hi> hath repented him, and that he ſent not the ſlave to me, but onely to try my diſcretion, I ſhould be guilty of all the miſchiefs that might follow thereupon, if by my imprudence and by my inconſideration I ſhould go and acquaint <hi>Jbrahim</hi> with a thing which certainly he could never conceal. In this uncertainty was the Princeſs, when as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60144:230"/> 
                  <hi>Jbrahim</hi> remained alone with her; and whereas this thought made her extremely muſing: May I, ſaid he unto her, Madam, without loſing the reſpect which I owe unto you, complain to you of your ſelf, in reproaching you for that you have not as much joy for my return, as you had grief for my departure? If this be a crime, ſaid the Princeſs, it is true that I am guilty of it; yet can I aſſure you, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe, that it is not occaſioned by any defect of affection, but by an habit which I have gotten of melancholy, I am afflicted more eaſily than I am comforted; I am more ſenſible of grief, than of joy; and in the eſtate wherein I finde my ſelf, there needs more things by far to content me, than there needs to render me infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely unhappy. It is not, continued ſhe, becauſe your return doth not give me all the joy that I am capable of, and even to that height, as without this remedy I am perſwaded I ſhould not have lived long; but in concluſion we are at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that is no little evill. <hi>Jbrahim</hi> hearing <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſpeak in this ſort, and obſerving her eyes and her face, he confirmed himſelf yet more in the opinion which he had; ſo that to be the better cleared therein, I confeſs, ſaid he unto her, that we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neerer to bad fortune, than to good; but you muſt confeſs unto me withall, that untill ſuch time as <hi>Soliman</hi> hath refuſed us the liberty which I am to ask of him, you have not ſo much cauſe to be melancholick, as you had when I parted for <hi>Perſia.</hi> The event of the war was doubtfull; it might have been long; I might have been beaten; I might have dyed there; and ſince none of theſe hath hapned, and that I may juſtly demand my liberty for a recompence, why do I, Madam, ſee more ſigns of grief in your minde, than when we had all to fear, and nothing to hope for? The Princeſs not anſwering preciſely to <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> began to make him partake her unquietneſs. He believed then that he was more unhappy than he thought he was; and ſuddenly calling to minde the change which he had noted in <hi>Solimans</hi> face, he no longer doubted but that there was ſomething which <hi>Iſabella</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Speak I earneſtly beſeech you, and whatſoever it may be, be pleaſed to let me know it. <hi>Jſabella</hi> would then have put him off, with aſſuring him that ſhe had no new matter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with; but the more ſhe ſtood off, the more unquietneſs ſhe gave him: Wherefore he began to caſt in his minde what the miſchief might be, which would not be told him; Hath any one, ſaid he unto her, wronged you during my abſence? hath any body conſpired againſt your life? hath the hate which <hi>Roxelana</hi> bears me, carried her to ſeek the means to hurt you? would ſhe have ſacrifiſed you to her revenge, as ſhe hath ſacrifiſed Prince <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to her rage? would they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you to change your Religion? hath <hi>Ruſtan</hi> plotted any thing againſt me? and (that which would be my laſt miſery, and which I think cannot poſſibly be) is <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> become my Rivall, or mine Enemy? The Princeſs thereupon not able to retain her tears, put her hand before her eyes to conceal them from <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he unto her then, gently pulling down her arm, do you anſwer me with tears? can it be poſſible, that this Prince ſhould hate me, or love you too much? leave me not long in pain, and I beſeech you, Madam, expreſs your ſelf more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I would I could draw you out of it, anſwered the Princeſs ſtill weeping, but ſince I cannot conceal that from you, which I have been commanded not to let you know, and that my tears have betrayed me, believe what they have told you, for it is but too true, and ſave me the labor of uſing any longer diſcourſe to you on ſo ſtrange a ſubject. What, cryed out <hi>Jbrahim</hi> then, wholly tranſported with grief, doth <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> love you! He hath told me ſo, replyed ſhe, and in ſuch a manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60144:231"/> 
                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> will he raviſh her from me for ever; and ſtab a dagger into the heart of a man, that hath hazarded his life for his glory, and that had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this illuſtrious perſon to his protection! after this, ſaid hee to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I will no longer truſt my ſelf; I beleeve, Madam, that I can betray you; I beleeve that I can abandon you; and that I can be your enemy; ſince the greateſt Prince of the earth hath been capable of violating the law of Nations, as well as naturall equity; of betraying the friendſhip which he had promiſed me; of forgetting the ſervices which I have done for him; of deſpiſing vertue; of not harkning to reaſon; and of blemiſhing his own glory with an unjuſt paſſion. But, Madam, added hee, I am too blame my ſelf, and I am the cauſe of your miſery: for why ſhould not I fear any thing from a Prince, who had dipt his hands in the blood of his ſon for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt love? he that had been capable of ſo cruell a thought, might eaſily forget the reſpect which he owed to your vertue; &amp; I am not excuſable for abandoning you. It is no time to ſpeak of that which is paſt, ſaid the Princeſs unto him, but to think of that which is to come. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was not for all that in an eſtate to give counſaile, for his minde was filled with ſo many ſeverall thoughts, as hee ſcarcely underſtood what <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſaid unto him. He was poſſeſſed with grief, anger, and repentance; hatred and jelouſie had alſo ſome place in his ſoul; nevertheleſs in the midſt of his tranſports, and although the intereſt of <hi>Iſabella</hi> prevailed over all others, yet had he loved <hi>Soliman</hi> ſo much, that there were ſome inſtants, wherein without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and without conſidering himſelf, he was afflicted for that this Prince had given this blemiſh to his life. But when as he ſurpriſed himſelf in this thought, he repented of it, as of a crime, and reentred into his former fury. At length, after that <hi>Iſabella</hi> and he had ſaid all that their grief and affection could ſuggeſt, and that the Princeſs had related to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> all that ſhe beleeved was neceſſary hee ſhould know, the better to adviſe on that which they had to doe, they found that their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was too much troubled, and they themſelves too much intereſſed in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in queſtion, for to judge ſoundly thereof. They reſolved then to call unto this counſell, both their he and ſhe friends; to the end that all of them together might ſeek out the meanes to avoyd the miſchief that menaced them. <hi>Iſabella</hi> for that effect willed <hi>Emilia</hi> to call them, and the French Marquis taking this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, brought this fair troup a little after into the Princeſs chamber, who with teares in her eyes craved pardon of her deer friends, for having made a ſecret to them of a thing, which ſhe would fain have concealed from her ſelf; and then, having recounted the eſtate wherein ſhee was with <hi>Soliman,</hi> ſhe filled their hearts with grief, both for the intereſt which they had in her fortune, and for their own; knowing very well that their liberty depended on <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who being at odds themſelves with <hi>Soliman,</hi> were not like to obtain that for others, which they could not obtain for themſelves. This miſery then being common, they all fell to think of what might be done. Some would have <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> without teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any knowledge of this unjuſt love, purſue his firſt deſigne, and demand his liberty of <hi>Soliman,</hi> becauſe, ſaid they, it may be that this Prince being aſhamed of his fault, and incenſed with <hi>Iſabellas</hi> conſtancie, will grant him his requeſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to deprive himſelf of the ſight of a man whom he can no longer look upon but with confuſion, and of a perſon, whom it is impoſſible for him to conquer. But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> oppoſed this opinion; for whereas he knew <hi>Soliman</hi> full well, he was ſure that love being once entred into his heart, would never goe out of it again but with violence; and that he could not be capable of repenting, but when as the crimes which love made him commit, were far greater than his paſſion. Then it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that no reſolution ſhould be taken, till the eight dayes, which <hi>Soliman</hi> had given <hi>Iſabella</hi> to make her anſwer in, were expired; becauſe the ſight of <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> it might be had revived the friendſhip which he bore him, and had baniſhed, or dimiſhed the love which he carried to her. But if <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was oppoſite to the firſt advice that was given, the Princeſs ſaid that ſhe would never conſent to this ſecond: for in concluſion, ſaid ſhe, after that which <hi>Soliman</hi> hath ſpoken to me, there are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60144:231"/> but two remidies to be choſen, either death or flight. The laſt is the beſt, replyed the Marquis, and if I may be beleeved, it ſhall be the only thing we will think of. This adviſe having been found the ſureſt and the eaſieſt, there was nothing more thought of, than of ſeeking out the meanes to execute it. It was not becauſe <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> did not upon the firſt apprehenſion of it follow this opinion with repugnancy, but becauſe he was perſwaded, that a Prince, who committed ſo great an infidelity againſt him, could not complain of him with reaſon for his going out of his Empire without his conſent. In this thought he conſidered with the reſt, which way they might draw themſelves out of captivity; in the end the reſolution was, that <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> being able to doe what he would, ſhould ſecretly aſſure himſelf of a veſſell; and that untill it was ready to part, he ſhould ſee <hi>Soliman</hi> as often as poſſible hee could, and take great care to keep him from ſuſpecting that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had ſpoken to him of his love to her. The reſt of the day being ſpent in this ſort, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Grand Viſier having underſtood that there was a Chriſtian Veſſell which was to ſet ſail the day enſuing, wrought in ſuch manner as he abſolutely aſſured himſelf of her; and without any bodies being aware of it, he cauſed a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian ſlaves, which were newly delivered, to enter into her. After he had taken this order, he went to ſee <hi>Soliman</hi> again, but it was with ſo much repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as it fell out well for him that he did not ſee him; it being moſt certain, that whereas he was not accuſtomed to diſguiſe his thoughts, it vvould have been impoſſible for him not to have teſtified ſomewhat of that vvhich he had in his heart. When he arrived at the Seraglio, he was told that the Grand Signior vvas at the Sultana Queens lodging; and whereas it was the onely place in the outward Seraglio, where <hi>Ibrahim</hi> entred not, he returned to his Palace; and there as long as the day laſted, he received the viſits of all the Baſſaes, Beglerbeis, and Sangiaes, that vvere at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Soliman</hi> was not vvithout unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he would willingly have had <hi>Ibrahim</hi> alwaies with him, to keep him from being with <hi>Jſabella,</hi> and would willingly withall never have ſeen him, ſince he could not do ſo without being aſhamed of his fault; and indeed it was out of this conſideration that he was gone to the Sultanaes lodging, that he might decline the ſight of him. It was not becauſe his mind was quieter in that place than in another; for he carryed his torment in his heart. His love, <hi>Jſabellaes</hi> conſtancy, and <hi>Jbrahims</hi> return, poſſeſſed him with ſtrange thoughts; and in the diſorder wherein his ſoul was, he made wiſhes againſt his own glory, and would that <hi>Jbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> had been beaten in <hi>Perſia;</hi> that his Army had been defeated; and that with a lavvafull pretext he could baniſh him from the Port, and retain <hi>Jſabella.</hi> It vvas not becauſe he knew not that his deſigns were unjuſt, but it was becauſe his paſſion was inſtead of reaſon to him, and made him deal in this ſort. <hi>Roxelana</hi> on her ſide was not in a little pain; ſhe ſaw <hi>Jſabella</hi> out of the Seraglio; and albeit the Slave, her confident, had aſſured her, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had not changed his mind for this Princeſs, yet ſhe feared that ſeeing her no longer, and ſeeing <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> the love which he bare to <hi>Jſabella</hi> would diminiſh, and that his good will to the Baſſa would reaſſume nevv forces. Howbeit ſhe hoped that <hi>Jſabella</hi> would acquaint the Grand Viſier with the love that the Sultan bore her; and that thereupon he would do ſomething which might give him opportunity to ruin him. In this belief an hour after <hi>Jſabella</hi> was gone out of the Seraglio ſhe ſent to will <hi>Ruſtan</hi> that he ſhould carefully obſerve all <hi>Jbrahims</hi> actions by the ſame Slave which before times had informed him of the Love that he carried to <hi>Jſabella. Ruſtan</hi> obeyed her ſo exactly, that what care ſoever the Grand Viſier took to conceal his deſign, yet did he ſuſpect it. Firſt he underſtood that the Baſſa had enquired, vvhether there were any Chriſtian veſſels in the Port that vvere to ſet ſayl in a few dayes, and that he had been told that one was to part the night follovving; he underſtood likewiſe by the Slave which was his confident, that after all ſtrangers vvere gone from him, he went into the Princeſſes chamber, and that vvithout heeding him he had ſayd to her, that he came from receiving the laſt viſits of his Courtiers. This man told him alſo, that the Italian Slave, in whom the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60144:232"/> greatly confided, ſeemed to be very buſie; as indeed it was he, who had in charge to ſee that the veſſell was made ready to ſet ſayl; and who by <hi>Jbrahims</hi> order had provided all things neceſſary for their departure. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> having received this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, juſt as it was night, let not for all that to go to the Seraglio, to advertiſe <hi>Roxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> of it; but whereas it was an unſeaſonable hour, he was conſtrained to give to a Capigibaſſi a Letter which he had written in caſe he could not ſpeak with her. <hi>Roxelana</hi> had no ſooner received it, but ſhe went her ſelf without further conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to acquaint <hi>Soliman</hi> with what <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had certified; and whereas this Prince, blinded by his paſſion, ſought but for a pretext to complain of <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> he hearkned to her with a great deal of impatience, which <hi>Roxelana</hi> having obſerved, ſhe made uſe of the occaſion, and told him, how ſhe had a long time known that <hi>Jbrahim</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Chriſtians; that without doubt he had ſome hidden deſign, which could not be comprehended; and adding yet more to that which <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had written, ſhe ſo wrought, that <hi>Soliman,</hi> to be cleared in the buſineſs, reſolved to ſend to <hi>Jbrahims</hi> Palace for him. And whereas there was no body about him whom he judged fit for it, <hi>Roxelana</hi> having propounded <hi>Ruſtan</hi> unto him, who ſhe ſaid was at the gate of the Seraglio, he conſented thereunto; and having cauſed him to enter, the Sultan commanded him to go to <hi>Jbrahims</hi> Palace, and will him to come preſently to him. For <hi>Soliman</hi> doubted not, if it were true that he had cauſed a veſſell to be made ready, but that it was for <hi>Jſabella,</hi> or for his friends; and that ſo, which ſoever it were, he ſhould have (according to the mind he was in) a juſt occaſion to ruin <hi>Jbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi> But <hi>Ruſtan</hi> was not like to find him at home; for as ſoon as it was night, he had cauſed <hi>Jſabella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia,</hi> with the reſt of their troup to go ſecretly out of his Palace; and he himſelf had got out after them thorough a door of his Garden, which was towards the Port, to embarque himſelf in that veſſell which he had made to be prepared, and whereof the Captain and the Pilot were abſolutely his, by means of the mony which he had cauſed to be given to them. Before his departure he had written a Letter to <hi>Soliman,</hi> and had left it with one of his ſervants, with order, that if any one came to ask for him from the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, to deliver it unto him; ſo that <hi>Ruſtan</hi> arriving at his houſe, found him not. It was in vain that he enquired after him, and what care ſoever he took for it, he could learn no other, than that he was not in his Palace; that <hi>Jſabella,</hi> his friends, and her friends, were not there neither; and that he had left a Letter for the Grand Signior. <hi>Ruſtan</hi> having taken it, ſent to the Port to learn whether any veſſell had ſet ſail, and then went in all haſt to the Sultan, to acquaint him with <hi>Jbrahims</hi> flight, and preſent him with the Letter which he had written to him; for he durſt not conceal it, though gladly he would, becauſe many had ſeen it delivered to him. My Lord, ſaid he when he was come unto him, <hi>Jbrahim</hi> is no longer at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This ſpeech amazed <hi>Soliman;</hi> but when he knew that <hi>Jſabella</hi> vvas out of his power he felt a redoubling of love, jealouſie, anger, hatred, diſpair, and fury. And when as <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had given him <hi>Jbrahims</hi> Letter, he broke up the ſeal with violence, and not knowing whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Soliman</hi> nothing moved with this Letter, tore it after he had read it; and the confuſion which it brought to his ſoul, inſtead of begetting repentance, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his fury the more. Let this ingratefull wretch, ſaid he to <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> be purſued, and let all that is poſſible be done to return him into my power. <hi>Roxelana</hi> entring hereupon into <hi>Solimans</hi> chamber, from whence ſhe had gone a little after <hi>Ruſtans</hi> departure, and perceiving his mind to be in the tearms wherein ſhe had long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have it, provoked his anger yet more; and propounded unto him the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of <hi>Ruſtan</hi> in the purſuit of <hi>Jbrahim:</hi> But that which ſhe thought cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do ſucceeded not with her; her intention was ſo to uſe the matter, as <hi>Ruſtan</hi> ſhould not find <hi>Jbrahim:</hi> For whereas her intereſt was, that he ſhould no longer have power, nor be longer at the Port, ſhe feared if he ſhould be brought back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that ſhe ſhould not oblige <hi>Soliman</hi> to ruin him uttetly; and ſo he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into grace again. Howbeit this deſign was not executed; for beſides that ſhe could not ſpeak with <hi>Ruſtan</hi> in private, the Grand Signior ſo abſolutely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to bring him back <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Jſabella,</hi> or never to return, as ſhe vvas conſtrained to let him go without ſaying any thing to him. He went then in all haſt to take a Galley to purſue him, becauſe he had underſtood from him whom he had ſent to the Port, that a Chriſtian veſſell had ſet ſayl by the Grand Viſiers order a little before. He imbarqued himſelf then with all the ſpeed that poſſibly he could; and not doubting but that he took the way of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> he made his Pilot hold the ſame courſe. In the mean time <hi>Soliman</hi> was not without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs; the privation of a good which he ardently deſired, made him regard it as a thing yet more precious; <hi>Iſabella</hi> appeared to him more amiable than ever he had ſeen her; yea he beleeved that it may be he might one day have won her heart; and in this belief he was infinitely afflicted. He looked upon <hi>Jbrahim</hi> with hatred, and this Prince was ſo unjuſt, as no longer to remember either his merit, his courage, or the friendſhip he had born him; nor to conſider him in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion but as his Rivall, and as a man who had ſtollen a perſon from him, of whom he was infinitely amorous.

For whereas they had embarqued themſelves at the beginning of the night, they beleeved that when their flight came the next day to be known, they ſhould be then far enough off from being taken any more: So that <hi>Jſabellaes</hi> mind was quiet enough; and the hope of being ſoon out of the Grand Signiors power, entertained her ſo agreeably, as fear had ſcarcely any place in her ſoul. Her friends began alſo to be no longer affraid of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and to be in doubt of nothing but Pirates and Tempeſts. <hi>Doria, Horatio,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves for all that might happen with conſtancy enough; the French Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis began already to talk according to his accuſtomed humor; when as <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano,</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60144:233"/> who was not ſo well aſſured of his good fortune, but that he had as much fear as hope, began to cry out that they were purſued, and that he ſaw a Galley which made towards them amain: Indeed he diſcovered <hi>Ruſtans</hi> Galley, even as they were near to that ſtrait where the two Caſtles of <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abydus</hi> are ſituated, which the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day call <hi>Dardanelli. Juſtiniano,</hi> having ſeen this Galley, turned himſelf to <hi>Jſabella,</hi> and asked her whether ſhe would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to dye in defending her? Your death, ſayd ſhe unto him him, I may not endure; but that excepted, I will conſent to any thing rather than to fall again into the hands of <hi>Soliman.</hi> After this diſcourſe, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> and his freinds began to prepare themſelves for defence; and though he had but few men, for to carry the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs the more ſecretly he durſt bring no more, yet were they not eaſie to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed; for as well ſlaves as Merchants were ſufficiently obliged to fight; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not only their lives &amp; liberties to defend, but their Siſters &amp; their Miſtriſſes too. On the other part <hi>Ruſtan</hi> knowing that this veſſel was the ſame which he ſought for, and fearing that the Chriſtian ſlaves which were in his Galley would not row ſpeedily enough, he promiſed them their liberty, if they imployed all their force in this occaſion, and that by their means he might ſtay <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> ſo that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by this hope, and without inquiring whether thoſe which they would take were Turks or Chriſtians, they rowed with ſo much vigor, as in a little time his Galley was within Cannon ſhot of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Veſſell. And to keep him from fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he diſcharged a piece of Ordnance, to advertiſe them that were of the Guard in the Caſtles of <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abidus,</hi> that enemies veſſells were in that place. This device failed not to work the expected effect; for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> knowing that there were on both ſides of this ſtraight forty pieces of Ordnance planted even with the water, which without doubt would after this ſignall diſcharge upon him if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to paſs, found himſelf ſtrangely troubled. For of one ſide he feared leſt he ſhould ſee <hi>Iſabella</hi> carried away with a Cannon-ſhot; on the other, <hi>Ruſtans</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was little leſs terrible to him; and in this unquietneſs he commanded his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot to doe one thing, and by and by unſayed it again. <hi>Iſabella</hi> would have had them expoſe themſelves rather to the fury of the Cannon, than to fight with <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan;</hi> but they were not long in an eſtate to chooſe what they had to doe; for this Galley which purſued them having overtaken them, and ſpite of their utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to the contrary having grapled her ſelf to them, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> followed by his friends, performed ſuch things in this occaſion, as ſurpaſſed the valour of the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Heroes.</hi> He wounded <hi>Ruſtan</hi> with his own hand; all thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves againſt him, fell preſently dead, either at his feet, or into the Sea. All <hi>Ruſtans</hi> ſouldiers fled from his incounter, and choſe rather to ſet upon ten others, than defend themſelves from him alone. In the mean time freſh ſuccor came to <hi>Ruſtan;</hi> for they of the two Caſtles of <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abidus,</hi> hearing the piece which he had cauſed to be ſhot off, came in Frigots with a great number of ſouldiers to ſee what the matter was; and finding a Chriſtian Veſſell ſet upon by Turks, they never inquired further, but joyned with them; and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſeeing his enemies redoubled, redoubled his courage too. One would have ſaid that he had recovered new forces; he paſt from one place to another in an inſtant; he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his own men, aſſaulted his enemies, and fighting deſperately, yet without loſing his judgement, he might peradventure have wearied and vanquiſhed them that aſſaulted him, had not <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> whilſt he was buſie in defending himſelf from fix which fought with him together, bethought him of a wile, which alone made him victor. He went with ſome ſouldiers to the Captains Cabbin, with his Scymitar in his hand, where the Princeſs and her dear friends, were more dead than alive, in attending the event of the fight. When firſt he entred, <hi>Iſabella</hi> gave a great skriek; but this cruell man, without hearkning to her complaints, drawing her with one hand, and holding his Scymitar in the other, pulled her to the Cabbin-door, and calling to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who turned his head that way, Reſolve thy ſelf, ſaid he unto him, to render up thy arms, or if thou doſt it not, to ſee the head of her I hold here taken from her ſhoulders. This dreadfull ſpeech made <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:60144:233"/> ſtop a little, during the which <hi>Jſabella</hi> without daunting, prayed him not to yeeld for to keep her from death, ſeeing ſhe deſired it. But <hi>Jbrahim</hi> being about to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and ſeeing him lift up his arm to ſtrike <hi>Iſabella,</hi> hold ſaid he unto him, throwing down his arms, and tendring his hands to them that invironed him; ſpare the life of this perſon, ſince I did not fight but to preſerve it; ſet her free, and make me a ſlave; and if I may obtain this of thee, I will not complain of thy cruelty. Alas! cried <hi>Jſabella</hi> then, the laying of you in irons is not giving me liberty, nor is the putting your life in the power of your enemies, the preſerving of mine! In the mean time <hi>Doria, Alphonſo, Horatio,</hi> and the French Marquis were ſtill indeavouring to doe their uttermoſt; but <hi>Jbrahim</hi> fearing leſt ſome out-rage ſhould be done to <hi>Jſabella,</hi> cryed to them to render themſelves, which they were conſtrained to doe; for <hi>Jbrahim</hi> fighting no longer, and being loaden with chains by <hi>Ruſtans</hi> commandment, they had all the enemies upon them; ſo that fight how they could, number prevailed over valour, and <hi>Ruſtan</hi> made himſelf Maſter of the Veſſell, and of the perſons whom he ſought for; and having forced them to paſs into his Galley he returned to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Theſe infortunate ones had yet the conſolation to make this voyage together without being ſeparated; for <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> buſied about ſtopping the blood which he loſt at the wound he had received, had not the inhumanity to keep them from talking together. <hi>Jbrahim</hi> was likewiſe as well as <hi>Horatio, Alphonſo, Doria,</hi> and the French Marquis, loaden with chains, which had been knocked off from ſome of thoſe ſlaves, who had been the cauſe of their taking by rowing with ſuch ſpeed. <hi>Jſabella</hi> and her friends, being with them, and not able to ſuccour them, augmented their torments yet more with the extreme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that appeared in them. Alas! ſaid <hi>Jſabella</hi> to <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> if I were ſure that death would be the greateſt miſery that can arrive unto me in the place whither we are going, I ſhould eaſily comfort my ſelf; yea and I ſhould regard it as an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than a misfortune: but the crueltie of our enemies will not ſtay there; for whereas <hi>Soliman</hi> knowes that I fear neither torments nor death, he will make me ſuffer in your perſon, and that makes up all my grief. Fear not for me, ſaid <hi>Jbrahim</hi> unto her, but onely think of preſerving your ſelf: <hi>Soliman</hi> loves you, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then to move his heart rather than to incenſe it, and be confident that death cannot be grievous to me, if I were aſſured of your life. No, no, anſwered <hi>Jſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> this is not the way I mean to hold, and you would blame me without doubt if I ſhould follow your counſell: I will die as well as you, and if my prayers can obtain any thing of <hi>Soliman,</hi> it ſhall be that we may die together. Augment not my torments, replyed the Illuſtrious Baſſa, and ſpeak not of your death, if you will not have me advance mine; live, my dear <hi>Jſabella,</hi> and let me alone periſh. I live, cried <hi>Jſabella?</hi> Ah! no, no, <hi>Jſabella</hi> knows not how to ſurvive her glory, and <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> which are the only things that can make her life agreeable, &amp; without the which ſhe wil not preſerve it. I may, added ſhe, live unhappy, infortunate, laden with chains, exiled from my country, without means, and without liberty; but I cannot live without honor, and without <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> ſo that if <hi>Soliman</hi> will raviſh me of my glory, and bereave me of the onely perſon that I love, I ſhall not waver between death and life; and I know what co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why have I not alwaies been your enemy, to keep you from having ſuch cruell ones? But what ſay I, ſenſleſs man, continued he, I merit the torments which I ſuffer, if I can repent me of having loved you: No, Madam, I cannot doe it; I would that my death might hinder yours, I would that I might indure all things for you, but I cannot wiſh that I could not adore you.

But added ſhe, before we are ſeperated (as without doubt we ſhall be) promiſe me, that what artifice ſoever our enemies may uſe to perſwade
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60144:234"/> you unto any thing to my diſadvantage, you will never beleeve it. For hold it for moſt aſſured, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> will dye a thouſand times, rather than do any thing unworthy of her vertue, and yours. Let me then have the ſatisfaction to hope, that the malice of our perſecutors ſhall make you beleeve nothing to my prejudice. Ah! Madam, cryed <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> it is for me to demand this favour of you; for whereas I have not rendred you ſo many markes of my affection, as I have received from your vertue, you may the more eaſily doubt of it. But beleeve, Madam, that I will dye adoring you; and if the loſs of my life may oblige <hi>Soliman</hi> to reſtore you to your liberty, as I purpoſe to beſeech it of him, I ſhall dye even with pleaſure. Let us not ſeparate our deſtinies, anfwered the Princeſs; either let us live together, or let us dye together. After ſo ſad a diſcourſe, the exceſs of their affection forced them to hold their peace; and their diſpleaſure being ſhut up in their heart, they felt it more vively than they did, whom as they eaſed themſelves with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. The unhappineſs of the perſons which were ingaged in their misfortune afflicted them the more; and they ſaw all about them ſo many occaſions of diſpair, as it might be ſaid, that never was the vertue of a perſon put to ſo hard a triall. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita, Sophronia, Emilia,</hi> and <hi>Leonida,</hi> were wholy diſſolved into teares; <hi>Alphonſo, Doria, Horatio,</hi> and the French Marquis, were alſo infinitely afflicted: and if <hi>Ruſtan</hi> could have been touched with any compaſſion, hee had been doubtleſs with ſo lamentable an object. But far from having any humanity for another, he was cruell to himſelf; for though he were wounded, yet the deſire which he had to deſtroy <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and to finiſh a thing which he had ſo well begun, made him in ſtead of repayring to his houſe to look to his wound, to goe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Serraglio aſſoon as he arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to behave himſelf ſo as if he had not been hurt at all. Preſently upon his landing, hee ſent to advertiſe <hi>Soliman</hi> of his return, and of the ſucceſs of his voyage. And whereas this Prince had increaſed his fury with his ſolitarineſs, he inſtantly commanded, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould be brought into the Seraglio, and put into ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with a ſure guard; and that all thoſe which had followed them ſhould bee put likewiſe into another place. Never was ſo deplorable a thing ſeen, as the execution of this commandment; <hi>Iſabella</hi> would not quit <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he too would not abandon her; and though they had well enough foreſeen that they ſhould be ſeparated, yet could they not for all that conſent thereunto. Their frends likewiſe would not leave them, and if <hi>Soliman</hi> could have been a ſpectator of ſo ſad a converſation, hee might peradventure have been moved to pitty. But at length <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> being conſtrained to reſolve for that which they could not avoyd, took their farwell of each other, as perſons that were never to ſee one another again; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing each other with their eyes as far as they could, they ſvvare unto themſelves to dye loving one another as faithfully as they had mutually promiſed. After <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had conducted <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to one quarter of the Seraglio, cauſed <hi>Iſabella</hi> to bee carried to another, and their friends to a third, he went to <hi>Soliman,</hi> whoſe minde had never been quiet, ſince he knew the ſucceſs of his voyage. For ſeeing <hi>Jbrahim</hi> and <hi>Jſabella</hi> in his hands, he ſcarcely knew what reſolution to take; for in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wherein things were, he muſt deſtroy the Baſſa, or render him his Miſtreſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding him as the Lover of <hi>Jſabella,</hi> he deſired his death; conſidering him as a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, he ſound it juſt; but remembring the affection which he had born him, hee had much ado to reſolve to deſtroy him. What ſhall I do, ſaid he to himſelf, with this ingratefull creature, who after ſo many favors which he hath received from me, ſo many honors which I have conferred on him, ſo many marks which I have rendred him of my good will, goes out of my Empire without my leave? This perfidious man, cried he, ſhould have conſidered me-thinks, how I had heretofore broken his chains to ſhare my Empire with him, and how he to whom he owed his life and his liberty, ought to have obliged him to a more exact fidelity. But this wretch prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the poſſeſſion of a woman before the greatneſs wherein I had ſet him, and my friendſhip, quits and abandons me; and not content to ſteal a perſon from me whom I love, and without whom I cannot live, he gets him away it may be with intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he hath in my Empire to make war upon me, and to recover from me that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60144:234"/> which he ſaith appertains unto him: But he was never of the Race of the <hi>Paleologues;</hi> And then, continued he, if he could perſwade me to it, that would be yet a further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to oblige me to deſtroy him. It behoves he ſhould die out of reaſon of State, as I pretend he ſhall die out of reaſon of Love. If I regard him as a ſlave, I have power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his life, ſince every ſlave that breaks his irons deſerves to loſe it. If I regard him as my ſubject, he is worthy of death for going out of my Empire without my conſent. If I regard him as a Chriſtian, I cannot hate him enough; and if I conſider him as an Enemy-Prince, it behoves he ſhould die, that the end of his life may make an end of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my Throne to my ſucceſſors. <hi>Soliman</hi> having, as it ſeemed to him, ſetled his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution firmly enough, felt ſome reſt in his minde. Howbeit ſuddenly ſome beam of light coming to him again, he was aſhamed of his own thoughts; yet would he not oppoſe them, but rather ſought how he might fortifie them; nevertheleſs there was one thing that retained his fury for a while: Suppoſe, ſaid he, that I reſolve to deſtroy <hi>Jbrahim;</hi> that he be already puniſhed for his ingratitude and perfidiouſneſs; that the end of his life hath ended the love which he bears to <hi>Jſabella;</hi> let us ſee after this, whether in thinking to do our ſelf ſervice, we do not hurt our ſelf: For can ſhe love a Prince, who bereaves her of the perſon that is deareſt to her in the world? But can ſhe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, love any other than <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as long as he is living? No, no, ſayd he raiſing his voyce, it behoves hee ſhould dye; and I ſhall alwayes have this conſolation, that if ſhee love not mee, ſhee ſhall at leaſtwiſe love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world. But (cried he again, after he had continued a while without ſpeaking) he whom I will deſtroy, is the ſame <hi>Jbrahim</hi> who hath done me ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervice, and whom I have ſo much loved; howbeit, continued he, it is <hi>Jſabellaes</hi> Lover; it is a fugitive ſlave; it is a revolted ſubject; it is a Prince my enemy; or it may be an impoſtor. In ſuch like thoughts as theſe was the Grand Signior, when as <hi>Ruſtan</hi> came to him, who out of his malice carried him to further violence againſt <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging matters, which he affirmed he had heard him ſpeak againſt him. Preſently therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Roxelana</hi> entred, who, making as if ſhe did not know, that there was any intereſt of love in the hatred which <hi>Soliman</hi> bore to <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> ſpake not but of the good of the State, and of the glory of the Empire. She repreſented to <hi>Soliman,</hi> how mightily he had alwaies protected the Chriſtians in all occaſions that had been preſented; as indeed ſhe lyed not. But although the moſt part of thoſe things were done by <hi>Solimans</hi> conſent in the favor of <hi>Jbrahim,</hi> yet was this Prince ſo unjuſt, as to hearken to this accuſation, as if he had been acquainted with new crimes. After then that this wicked woman had made him reſolve to put <hi>Jbrahim</hi> to death, ſhe told him moreover, that if haſt were not made to take away his life, the people undoubtedly would riſe to ſave him; for, ſaid ſhe, out of the deſign which he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th had to uſurp the Empire, he hath alwaies taken great care to make himſelf to be beloved of them. <hi>Soliman</hi> ſeeing himſelf upon the point of abſolutely reſolving the matter, felt a new combat in his heart; love, hatred, jealouſie, friendſhip, ſhame, and glory, did their laſt and uttermoſt endeavor to vanquiſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but at length vertue was ſurmounted in this occaſion by the wickedneſs of <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> and <hi>Ruſtan:</hi> And <hi>Soliman</hi> conſented that without further delay he ſhould go and execute this fatall ſentence, which their hatred, rather than he, pronounced againſt the illuſtrious <hi>Jbrahim.</hi> Away he went with a great deal of ſpeed, for fear leſt the Sultan ſhould alter his mind. Nevertheleſs not daring wholly to fall in the uſuall form, he ſent for <hi>Jbrahim</hi> to come to ſupper; and this perfidious wretch, who feared a revolt, kept all that were in the Seraglio from going forth. In the mean time <hi>Jbrahim</hi> being ſet at table as the reſt, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> in the midſt of the meal preſented him with a robe of black velvet, which was an undoubted mark, that the end of this fatal feaſt ſhould be the end of his life: For after this manner is the news of death denounced to perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that are to loſe their lives in the Seraglio. <hi>Jbrahim</hi> ſeeing his ruin certain, received this robe for all that with a great deal of conſtancie. And whereas it was preſented to him by <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> becauſe no body elſe would tender him this ſtrange preſent; I receive it, ſayd he unto him, without fearing the death which it preſageth, and without being any whit ſurpriſed therewith, knowing full well that it is a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the charge which I have poſſeſt, and that few Grand Viſiers have dyed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies: But I receive it with grief, becauſe it blemiſheth the glory of a Prince
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60144:235"/> whom I have loved, and for that it is offered to me by the hand of <hi>Ruſtan.</hi> This ceremony much afflicted all them that ſaw it; yet did not <hi>Ibrahim</hi> riſe til the time which cuſtom requires in ſuch like occaſions was paſt; nor forbear talking to ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Empire, which were at this fatal ſupper by <hi>Ruſtans</hi> order in the grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors name; for he feared if they ſhould have gone forth, and acquainted the people, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was going to be put to death, they would have riſen before he had been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And truly this deſign was not amiſs; for whereas <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was infinitely beloved, their eys were all bedew'd with tears, and certainly had they had arms, they would have attempted to ſuccor him, or at leaſtwiſe would have loſt themſelves with him. Never was there a more deplorable feaſt than this ſame; none that were preſent at it did eat any thing; they ſeemed all to be condemned to death; and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> only teſtified by the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of his countenance, and by his conſtancy, that he was in caſe to comfort the reſt. Four mutes, which were to ſtrangle him, ſtood before him, with each of them a black ſilk bow-ſtring in his hand, which was to ſerve for that deadly office. Now though this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject poſſeſt all thoſe that conſidered it, with terror and pitie, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſeemed no more ſenſible of fear, than <hi>Ruſtan</hi> was of compaſſion. This Illuſtrious Baſſa was ſeen with an admirable tranquillity, and with a conſtancy without affectation; he indured his miſery without murmuring; he beheld the tears of others, without ſhedding any; and if any ſign of ſadneſs appeared in his face, the intereſt of <hi>Iſabella</hi> alone was the cauſe of it; &amp; indeed this thought made him ſuffer very much. The regret of being ſeparated from her; the uncertainty of what ſhould become of her after his death, which was ſcarcely irkſom unto him, but for the grief which <hi>Iſabella</hi> would take at it, repleniſhed him with heavy thoughts. Whilſt he was in this eſtate; whilſt he attended the time of his execution; and whilſt he was preparing to intreat ſome of them that were about him, to ſay ſomething to <hi>Soliman</hi> for the preſervation of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the Sultan was not without unquietneſs; <hi>Roxelana,</hi> who had ſtill remained with him, had not only kept his mind from inclining to compaſſion, but contrarily had ſo incenſed it, as he many times ſeemed to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, for that he could not receive news of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> death. Nevertheleſs he had no ſooner had ſuch a like thought, but ſtraightway he was of another opinion: He would have a thing, and he would not have it; and in this incertainty his imagination repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him all <hi>Jbrahims</hi> whole life. He ſought not for all that to remember the friendſhip which he had born him, and the marks which he had given him of it, but to hate him the more. This ingratefull man, ſaid he, could not reſolve to comply with a Prince, who would have given him his daughter in mariage; who would have allied himſelf to him; and who, beſides yeelding up his Throne to him, hath done all things for him. This remembrance wrought a ſtrange effect in <hi>Soliman;</hi> he ſuddenly changed colour, &amp; after he had muſed a little, as it were to call ſomething to his memory, he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with ſtrange precipitation, to have <hi>Ruſtan</hi> fetched back again, and looking about him, the matter is at an end, ſaid he, wholly tranſported with fury; I cannot deſtroy mine enemy; he muſt live, ſince I have ſworn it; let one go with all ſpeed, ſaid he, to ſome of his attendants, and revoke the ſentence which I have given; but no delay muſt be made, for otherwiſe I ſhal draw the heavy wrath of heaven upon my head. <hi>Roxelana,</hi> ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe, would have kept them from obeying the grand Signior, untill ſhe knew from whence this mutation came. But having commanded a ſecond time, that one ſhould go &amp; do that which he had ordained, ſhe was compelled to conſent unto it. What ſo ſudden a change, ſaid ſhe unto him, is arrived in thy Highneſs mind? is it poſſible that <hi>Soliman,</hi> whom I have heard an hundred times ſay, that repentance is a weakneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was not capable, ſhould at length be poſſeſſed with it at this preſent? No, ſaid <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to her, I do not repent, but contrariwiſe that I may not repent, and that I may keep my word, I am carried to that which I do. The Sultana having obliged him to explain himſelf more clearly, he informed her, how as he was laboring to remember the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was ingaged to him, to the end he might deteſt his ingratitude ſo much the more, his memory had repreſented unto him, how he would once have given him the <hi>Sultana Aſteria</hi> to wife, &amp; how at the ſame time, &amp; on the ſame day, to ſecure <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> from the fear which he ſeemed to have of the change of his fortune, he had ſworn to him by <hi>Alla,</hi> that as long as he lived he ſhould not dy a violent death. After this, ſaid he to her, Never ask me what hath made me alter my minde: I do not repent, I would ſtill have <hi>Jbrahim</hi> deſtroyed, but being unable to put him to death without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60144:235"/> violating my Oath; I muſt no longer think of it; mine Enemy muſt live; I muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; and all this is, becauſe I my ſelf have tyed the hand, which ſhould ſtrike a dagger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was not ſo ſcrupulous as <hi>Soliman,</hi> nor made ſo exact a profeſſion of keeping her word, did what ſhe could to perſwade him not to keep his. No, ſaid he unto her, I may not fail in it; and had I promiſed my Empire and my Liberty, I ſhould deſcend from my Throne, and put on the Irons my ſelf which I was to wear. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> muſt live, ſince I have promiſed it; I have ſworn by <hi>ALLA,</hi> and that is to ſay all that can be ſaid. I ſhould draw down the wrath of Heaven upon me; and I ſhould do that which I have never done, if I ſhould do otherwiſe. I have obſerved all that ever I have promiſed in my life, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Oath; having then ſworn ſo ſolemnly, I may by no means break it. I ſhould deſtroy mine enemy, but thereby I ſhould bring one into my heart, that would perſecute me eternally; and repentance, which is a motion unknown to me, would without doubt find place in my Soul. At length after a long conteſtation, <hi>Roxelana</hi> perſwaded <hi>Soliman,</hi> to take the advice of the <hi>Muphti,</hi> who ſhe knew was abſolutely hers, as having gotten him the place which he held during <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s abſence. And albeit <hi>Soliman</hi> did not think that this man could find out any thing that would ſatisfie him, yet he ſent for him. When he was come, and that <hi>Roxelana,</hi> in propounding the matter unto him, had dextrouſly ſignified to him that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the death of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> this man, who naturally had wit, malice, and cunning, was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſufficiently troubled to anſwer preciſely unto that which was demanded of him for the contenting of <hi>Roxelana.</hi> He ſaid then that this affair was not to be ſpoken of precipitouſly; and having required an hours time to think of it, after he had cauſed <hi>Soliman</hi> to repeat unto him the very ſame words, which he had before-time uſed to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he fell deeply a muſing: But he was not long in ſearching out that which he did not think to find; My Lord, ſaid he to <hi>Soliman,</hi> the Prophet, whom we worſhip, hath no doubt inſpired me with that which I am going to tell thy Highneſs, that thou mayſt be able to puniſh him whom thou wouldſt deſtroy. And when as <hi>Soliman</hi> had asked him how he thought to perform that which he ſaid, he obliged him to repeat once more unto him the promiſe which he had made to <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it but too well, anſwered the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and lo the very words which I ſpake. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> (ſaid I unto him) <hi>how I ſwear unto thee by</hi> ALLA, <hi>that as long as</hi> Soliman <hi>lives, thou ſhalt not dye a violent death.</hi> This ſufficeth, replyed the <hi>Muphti,</hi> for, my Lord, to expreſs my thought to thy Highneſs; is it not true, that the promiſe, which thou haſt made to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> is a thing which cannot ſecure him but only during thy life? and is it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that thy Succeſſors ſhould not be obliged to preſerve him? It being ſo, my Lord, ſaid he unto him, it will not be hard for me to content thee. For thy Highneſs having promiſed <hi>Ibrahim, that he ſhall not dye a violent death, as long as Soliman lives;</hi> if I can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to thee, that there are every day ſome hours, wherein <hi>Soliman</hi> doth not live, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to thee by the ſame reaſon, that during the ſaid time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> may dye, without breaking of thy Highneſs word.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> hearing him ſpeak thus, beleeved that this man knew not very well what he would ſay; but the other nothing daunted, and ſpeaking to him with as much confidence, as if he had been inſpired from Heaven; My Lord, ſaid he unto him, it is a matter whereof no body is ignorant, that Sleep is called the brother of Death by all Nations, and in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; and truly it is not without cauſe that he is termed ſo, it being certain, that a man which is aſleep cannot with reaſon be ſaid to be living, ſince we ſee that he is deprived of all the functions of a reaſonable life, which alone is the life of man: I confeſs indeed how in that eſtate he ſtill enjoys the life of plants, but not that of man, which conſiſts not but in the uſe of Reaſon, whereof he is wholly bereft in that eſtate. Sleep equals Kings and Shepherds as well as Death, the ſtupid and the witty, the happy and the unhappy, good men and bad; and there is no difference ſeen between them, but that ſleep is a ſhort death, and death an eternal ſleep. Wherefore it being evident, that a man aſleep cannot (to ſpeak reaſonably) be ſaid to be living, I conclude from thence, that thy Highneſs, without breaking thy word, may take away <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s life when as ſleep hath throughly benummed thy ſenſe and Reaſon. <hi>Roxelana</hi> failed not to approve of this advice, and maintained that he had ſpoken judiciouſly. But for <hi>Soliman,</hi> he yielded not with ſo much facility; he made many objections to the <hi>Muphti,</hi> whereunto he ſtill anſwered, with as much cunning as wickedneſs.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60144:236"/>
               <p>Thus, although this Prince had a very piercing wit in all other things, yet the deſire which he had to make away <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> perſwaded him that the <hi>Muphti</hi> had Reaſon; and that he might put the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> to death when he was aſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ep. For, this wicked man ſaid to him, thy Highneſs hath not abſolutely promiſed him, not to put him to death, but only, <hi>that he ſhould not dye a violent death, as long as Soliman lives,</hi> and <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhall not live, when as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhall dye. This deſign being concluded, it was reſolved, that they ſhould tarry till night was come for the executing of it. For whereas ſleep is not a voluntary act, they thought it requiſite to attend till the time of ſleep was come.</p>
               <p>In the mean ſeaſon <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had been brought back to the place which ſerved him for a priſon, not knowing whether grace would be ſhewed him, or whether his execution was but deferred. This incertainty was almoſt as diſpleaſing, as the aſſurance of an approaching death had been grievous to him; yet did he not ask any thing that regarded himſelf directly, but only enquired after <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who on her part was not without a world of grief. She had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had been lead to a place, where oftentimes the <hi>grand Viſiers</hi> had been deprived of their lives, and that made her to be as much afflicted, as if ſhe had already ſeen him breathe out his laſt. It may be, ſaid ſhe, that now whil'ſt I am ſpeaking <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> is defending himſelf againſt his Executioners; it may be he is yielding up his laſt breath, and is thinking of me once for all. Ah! if it be ſo, cryed ſhe, I beſeech Heaven at leaſtwiſe to ſpare me the affliction that I may not hear of his loſs, and by my death to keep me from the grief of lamenting his. Howbeit I fear, ſaid ſhe, that my prayers will not be heard, and that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi>'s cruelty will let me live to perſecute me: But let him arm his Executioners, let him invent torments, I will complain no more after this ſorrow; he that ſhall acquaint me with the loſs of <hi>Juſtiniaeno,</hi> ſhall render me inſenſible to all others. Alas! what ſay I? added ſhe, it ſeems in hearing me ſpeak, that I will conſerve my life after he ſhall be deprived of his; no, no, <hi>Iſabella</hi> will not ſurvive <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> and that which the rage of <hi>Soliman</hi> will not do, grief alone ſhall execute: Let this unjuſt Prince do what he will, I hope, that I ſhall get out of his power, by getting out of my life; Heaven is intereſſed in the prayer which I make unto it; I beg this grace of it to preſerve mine innocence; and if my deſpair be a fault, I hope it will pardon it in regard of the greatneſs of my misfortune, of the purity of my affection, and of mine own weakneſs.</p>
               <p>In this deplorable eſtate, <hi>Iſabella</hi> having underſtood, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had been brought back to his quarter, hope began again to find ſome place in her Soul; and ſhe beleeved that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> having deſired to ſee him, had peradventure been moved to compaſſion: <hi>Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia,</hi> and the reſt of their Troop, which were in another place, had the ſame hope, hearing what had paſt: But the matter went otherwiſe; for as ſoon as night was come, <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> who wholly governed this deadly ceremony, went himſelf a ſecond time to fetch <hi>Ibrahim</hi> by the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Command. He led him then into the ſame Hall, where formerly he had been; and having left him in the company of four mutes, which were to ſtrangle him, as ſoon as <hi>Soliman</hi> was aſleep, he returned to this Prince, who had at that time no greater a longing then to make away <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> As for him, although he did not fear death, and was exceeding peaceable, yet had his Soul great agitations. Ah, ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſhall never ſee <hi>Iſabella</hi> more I and I ſhall not only be deprived of her ſight, but I ſhall abandon her to the violence of a Prince, who I beleeved had been her Protector: and who it may be, provoked by her vertue, will take away her life, as well as mine; for ſince <hi>Soliman</hi> can conſent to my death, he may well ſign hers. Alas, continued he, to what an eſtate am I reduced! If I wiſh that ſhe ſhould live, I make wiſhes againſt her glory; I conſent to the expoſing of her to the rigor of a violent and amorous Prince. I cannot wiſh her her life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing her wrong; and then again, not only I cannot deſire her death, but I cannot ſo much as think of it, without a deſpair that is not to be parelled. If this Prince, who is my Rival, could be her husband, I would make vows againſt my ſelf, and I love <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſo much, as to be willing to ſave her life with the loſs of all my felicity. But as the caſe ſtands, ſhe cannot be his, not only without infidelity, not only without infamy, but with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crime. Alas! added he, if it were not ſo, my loſs ſhould not be without comfort; loving me as ſhe doth, ſhe would live without pleaſure, but alſo without ſhame. She would bewail my death without other intereſt then that of conſerving my memory; and fear having no place in her heart, the grief alone of having loſt me would wholly poſſeſs her Soul. If I
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60144:236"/> dyed, added he, in defending <hi>Iſabella;</hi> if the loſs of my life could reſtore her to her liberty, I ſhould be happy, and I ſhould think my fortune worthy of envy. But I dye to leave her in the power of her enemy; I dye without ſerving her, and without d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>livering her; nay I dye without bidding her farewell.</p>
               <p>Hereat <hi>Ibrahim</hi> redoubled his grief, and his mind ſeeking for new occaſions to torment him, he was taken with a remorſe of Conſcience for having ſo long a time worn a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> habit. He was perſwaded that the miſery whereinto he was fallen was a puniſhment for this diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. He thought he had been ill counſelled, and though his intention had been pure, and that he had not done it but out of a deſign to ſerve Chriſtendom, to whom it had been very profitable, and that his faith had never been ſhaken, yet he beleeved notwithſtanding that he was faulty. This reflexion made him lift up his ſpirit to Heaven; crave pardon for his levity; repent him of his miſdeeds; and then pray that <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s innocency might not be involved in the chaſtiſement of his crime.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that yet afflicted <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was, that in his misfortune he could not find any that would tell the <hi>Sultan</hi> that which he had reſolved to requeſt of him in the favor of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> for <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had taken order to the contrary. He had alſo by the power of <hi>Roxelana</hi> kept every body from going out of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> after <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was entred into it; ſo that although it was known in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that there was ſome great diſorder between <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> yet the people did not ſuſpect, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> could hate him with ſo much violence; for if they had been of that opinion, loving <hi>Ibrahim</hi> as they did, they would without doubt have ſet fire on the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> rather then not have ſuccored him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Rustan</hi> being returned to <hi>Soliman,</hi> whoſe mind was full of nothing but deadly thoughts, this Prince, to ſatisfie that fantaſtick ſcruple, which obliged him not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the death of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to be unjuſt, but becauſe he had promiſed him, that he ſhould not dye as long as he lived, commanded him to keep at his beds head, and to be ſure not to go to put <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to death, till he was faſt aſleep. After this order given, <hi>Soliman</hi> layd him down with an intention (if one may be permitted to ſpeak ſo) as it were to ſummon ſleep with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and quietneſs. He did what he could to divert his mind from all kind of objects; to the end that ceaſing to think, he might the more eaſily let himſelf be vanquiſhed by this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Enemy, who always ſurmounts thoſe more eaſily which reſiſt him, then thoſe which ſeek him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan,</hi> being thus recollected within himſelf, remained a while with ſo much tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity in appearance, as <hi>Rustan</hi> beleeved that he was aſleep, and that he might go and put <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to death; But he had ſcarcely made one ſtep, when as this Prince riſing up in his bed, Stay, ſaid he unto him, I am not aſleep; and I will not have thee part from hence, till thou art certain I am ſo. <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> not daring to contradict the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and fearing to make him more awake then he was, if he talked longer to him, only promiſed him not to offer any more to go out of his chamber, till he was well aſſured that he could hear nothing. After this <hi>Soliman</hi> did yet all that he could to ſleep; howbeit he had no ſooner cloſed his eyes, but his unquietneſs augmented; he was vexed that he could not be maſter of his thoughts, and that that which he did to provoke ſleep, was that which awakened him the more. He turned him on one ſide, and then on the other, and yet was not able to find any reſt. One might have ſaid that he met with thorns every where; that the change of place redoubled his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs; and when of purpoſe he forbore from ſpeaking, and complaining aloud, his ſighs gave <hi>Ruſtan</hi> but too many ſigns that he was not aſleep. <hi>Soliman</hi>'s impatience growing ſtronger, he thought if he walked a while, that it may be he ſhould become drowzy with wearineſs: He got out of his bed then, and walking ſometimes with violence, and ſometimes with leſs precipitation, it might have been ſaid, that he was the cauſe of as much unquietneſs to <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> as he felt himſelf, to ſee that he gave him not the means to execute the deſires of the cruel <hi>Roxelana.</hi> He ſtood ſtill many times, and then began again to walk faſter then he had done. Afterwards he leaned down in one place, and then in another, ſcarcely knowing what he did, nor what he would do. When as he had walked a long time, and that through wearineſs he had layd himſelf down again upon his bed, he found yet leſs diſpoſition to ſleep then before; for his agitation having diſſipated ſome vapors, which peradventure might have lulled his Reaſon, and charmed his diſpleaſure, he no ſooner had a mind to cloſe his eyes, but his imagination repreſented things yet more lively unto him; And whereas a long time before
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60144:237"/> he had had none but violent paſſions, ſuch then too were all his thoughts. How unhappy am I, ſaid he to himſelf! I find an impoſſibility in all that I deſire; the leaſt things are forbidden me; even ſleep, which all my Subjects enjoy, is to me a prohibited good; that which I do to get it, is that which deprives me of it; and though I change place, yet ſtill is it all one with me; ſurely I muſt be ſeparated from my ſelf, if I will find the reſt which I ſeek for. <hi>In fine,</hi> I am more an enemy to my ſelf, then <hi>Ibrahim</hi> is, yea and I am more unhappy then he.</p>
               <p>After his unquietneſs had made him change place an hundred times, <hi>Rustan,</hi> ſeeing day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, would have perſwaded him not to amuſe himſelf about this ſcruple, and to permit him to go and ſtrangle <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with his own hands, to puniſh him, ſaid he, for the unquietneſs which he gives thy Highneſs: But <hi>Soliman</hi> ſpake unto him with ſo much fury, as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to hold his peace. This cruel motion of <hi>Rustan</hi>'s, ſtruck this Prince with horror, and whereas it is a way to compaſſion, leaning on a table, which was near to his bed, his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation inſenſibly preſented him with other objects. He ſaw <hi>Iſabella</hi> all in tears for the death of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> yea it repreſented to him the deplorable eſtate wherein he was; he remembred the time when he was his Slave; and that glorious day, wherein loaden with chains he had ſaved him his Empire and his life: And comparing it with that wherein he was then, he could not chuſe but be moved at it. After this, the ſight of <hi>Ruſtan</hi> brought to his memory all the miſeries of his houſe, and all the violences which he had done by his, and <hi>Roxelana</hi>'s counſel. The death of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> that of <hi>Sarraida,</hi> of her ſon, of <hi>Gianger,</hi> the forcible carrying away of <hi>Axiamira,</hi> her impriſonment, the War of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the things which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had performed therein, the death of <hi>Zelebis,</hi> and many other ſuch like things, which filled his mind with ſo many deadly <hi>ideas,</hi> as the love which he bore to <hi>Iſabella</hi> began to be too weak to diſſipate them. He felt ſome repugnancy in his heart for that which he did; and his Reaſon being ſuddenly untangled, What do I, ſaid he to himſelf, ſenſleſs that I am, not to conſider, that the impoſſibility which I find to deſtroy a diſarmed man, whom I hold in my hands, who is loaden with irons, and who is without defence in the midſt of his Executioners, is without doubt a ſign that Heaven protects him. For if it were not ſo, I had deſtroyed him ere this; I had not promiſed him ſo long ago that I would not put him to death; I had not remembred it ſo preciſely; this Artifice, which they have found out for me to be revenged, had ſucceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d; I had ſlept, and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had been dead. But I ſee plainly, as I have ſaid, that Heaven guards him, and that it will not let me be revenged. But alas! ſaid he ſtill to himſelf, for what crime, for what injury, for what outrage will I be revenged? No, no, continued he, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> is not guilty, and I alone am the offender; for I owe all things to him, and he owes nothing to me. It is true, that he would have gone out of my Empire without my leave, but it was to ſave his Miſtreſs; and this generous man, who might have overthrown all my <hi>State,</hi> to ſecure himſelf, and to be revenged of the infidelity which I have uſed to him, was contented to fly away like a ſimple Slave. Let us harken to Reaſon which ſpeaks to us; let us harken to the voyce of the Prophet who holds our hand; and let us harken no longer to this unjuſt love that poſſeſſeth us.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Soliman</hi> could not retain his tears, and the love which he bore to <hi>Iſabella</hi> made him, that he ſtill found ſome difficulty in reſolving to be deprived of her: But <hi>Ruſtan</hi>'s endevoring once more to carry him to violence made him incline wholly to Vertues ſide. No, no, ſaid he unto him, baſe as thou art, I will commit no more crimes by thy counſel; the Prophet, who guards me, will keep me from dipping my hands in the blood of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and if I am to ſhed any, it muſt be theirs, who blemiſh my glory with their pernicious counſels. <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> hearing <hi>Soliman</hi> ſpeak in this manner, thought that he had loſt his Reaſon; for whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new had happened, he could not comprehend, how in ſo ſhort a time ſo great a change ſhould arrive unto him. But he knew not, that they, which have vertuous inclinations, and which are not wicked but by a violent paſſion, or the counſel of others, have need but of a moment to carry them to that which is good. Their Reaſon is no ſooner cleared, but they find a mighty ſuccor in themſelves; and ſo ſoon as they have a will to fight, the victory is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theirs. <hi>Soliman</hi> gave an illuſtrious example of this verity in this occaſion; it being moſt ſure, that never was there a greater or more ſudden change made, then that which was made in his Soul. He charged <hi>Ruſtan</hi> not to go out of his chamber, and commanded another to go and fetch <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> to him, who little thought what Vertue was doing for their advantage. This Prince nevertheleſs had great unquietneſs ſtill; he ſeemed uncertain in his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60144:237"/> reſolutions; and during the agitations of his Soul, he cryed out ſometimes, O Heaven! muſt <hi>Ibrahim</hi> be deſtroyed? then ſuddenly checking himſelf; but alſo, ſaid he, can I reſolve to loſe <hi>Iſabella?</hi> After this, he ſat him down on four Cuſhions, and hiding his face with both his hands, leaning on a table, as it were the better to think of that which he would reſolve of, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> remained in ſtrange pain.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ibrahim</hi> could not comprehend, for what reaſon they made him attend ſo long for his death. He feared leſt ſome violence ſhould be done to <hi>Iſabella;</hi> he doubted leſt they ſhould be ſo cruel as to put her to death before his eyes; and in this pain, death no doubt would have been a remedy unto him, had not the thought of never ſeeing <hi>Iſabella</hi> again rendred it more grievous to him, for that conſideration, then for the loſs of his life. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of his Soul for all that appeared not in his face; and one would hardly have beleeved in looking on him, that he did think he ſhould dye every minute. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> on her part, was not without trouble; for having underſtood, that they came to fetch <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſhe certainly believed that he was loſt, and was already preparing to follow him, when as they, who had order to go for her, entred all into her chamber. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw them, and that they had told her how they had order to carry her before <hi>Soliman;</hi> if it be to put me to death in his preſence, anſwered ſhe, I will give him thanks: But acquaint me at leaſtwiſe, whether <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> be living, and whether we ſhall dye together or no. Theſe men, not knowing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi>'s intentions, durſt ſcarce anſwer her; only they aſſured her that ſhe ſhould ſee the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> very ſuddenly, as indeed they led her into the Hall where he was, attending the time of his execution. There were ſeen about him his Guards weeping, and four Mutes that were to ſtrangle him, and that having in their hands Bow ſtrings of black ſilk for that purpoſe, ſeemed alſo to haue ſome compaſſion of him.</p>
               <p>This doleful object having touch'd the heart of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſhe could not forbear giving a great skriek: Alaſs, ſaid ſhe, how do I repent me of my wiſh! and how much more ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able had it been for me to dye alone, then to dye with you? <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſeeing and hearing her ſpeak thus; What, Madam, ſaid he unto her, will they attempt upon your life? Ah! no, no, continued he, turning him to thoſe that invironed him, it is a thing I ſhall never endur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: when they ſhall meddle with none but me, I will tender my neck to them without reſiſtance; but if they attempt any thing on this Princeſs, I proteſt that I will ſtrangle him with mine own hands that ſhall offer any outrage to her. This is not that which I will have, anſwered ſhe; defend not my life, if they attempt upon yours, ſince they are to be inſeparable. I have not wiſh'd to live, but onely that I may not ſee you dye. As they would have continued ſpeaking, they that came for them told them, that they had nothing elſe in charge but to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them before the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> Let us go then, ſaid the Princeſs to him, let us go my dear <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> I repent me of my weakneſs, and ſince I muſt dye, provided that I dye in your preſence, I ſhall be glad that we may dye together: Let us go then and beg for death of <hi>Soliman</hi> as a grace. Ah! Madam, cryed the illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſpeak not of your death, if you will not have me dye in deſpair. Let us go, Madam, let us go rather to beg your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and obtain of him that the loſs of my life may be the price of it. I will not have it without you, anſwered ſhe, wherefore perſiſt not in wiſhing to ſave me.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they arrived at <hi>Soliman's</hi> Chamber, whom they found ſtill leaning on a Table, and in a poſture, that they could not ſee his face. As ſoon as they were there, <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> caſt themſelves at his feet: My Lord, ſaid the Princeſs, if I may obtain the grace of thee, that I may dye with <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> I will not complain of thy Highneſs; but contrarily I will praiſe thy juſtice. I am guilty, my Lord, and of an horrible crime againſt thee I have made thee deſpiſe the friendſhip which thou bareſt to <hi>Juſtiniano;</hi> I have made thee abandon Reaſon; I have put a ſtain on thy life; I have blemiſhed thy glory; I have troubled thy reſt; and I have conſtrained the greateſt Prince of the Earth to oppoſe all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, which carry him to vertue, for to follow an unjuſt paſſion. Thou plainly ſeeſt, my Lord, that wrath ought to have a more juſt foundation in thy ſoul, then this Love, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts thee, and perſecutes me. Change thy paſſion in my favor, but in ſuch ſort, that as I have been the object of thy love, ſo I may be likewiſe of thy hate. Think of revenging thy ſelf on the true cauſe of thy unquietneſs; think of deſtroying, and not of gaining me; the laſt is impoſſible, and the other is very eaſie for thee. It is not becauſe, if my tears could move thee, I can yet aſſure thee that hate ſhould have a place in my ſoul: For know, my Lord,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60144:238"/> that even <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> from whom thou wilt take away, both his honor, his life, and my perſon, which is as dear to him as both the other, yet cannot hate thee. I have ſeen it in his eyes, I have known it by his diſcourſe; he complains of fortune; he accuſes that which thy High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs calls beauty in me; he names that weakneſs, which another would name injuſtice; <hi>in fine,</hi> my Lord, being ready to dye innocently by thy directions and command, yet am I well aſſured, that he will dye without hatred; and that even in dying, he will make vows to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Heaven an advantageous change for thee. Judg after this, whether thou oughteſt to refuſe me the grace that I may dye, and that he may be ſaved, ſince I am guilty and he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
               <p>My Lord, ſaid <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> interrupting her, harken not to the vertuous <hi>Iſabella,</hi> but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the greatneſs of her courage, and ſuffer not thy ſelf to be perſwaded to that which ſhe deſires of thee. I will not ſtand to examine whether I am culpable, or whether I am not, ſince to be hated of thee, is to be ſo; but, my Lord, I will onely tell thee, that if the ſentence of my death ſhall be pronounced by thy mouth, I will not murmur at it. I confeſs my weakneſs to thee, my Lord; I cannot yet believe, but that all that which I have ſeen ſince my return, is an inchantment, and not a truth. For how can it be imagined, that great <hi>Soliman,</hi> who hath loved me ſo tenderly, and given me ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marks thereof, can be carryed at this preſent to ſuch unjuſt deſigns? That with the ſame hand, wherewith he broke my chains, and put the reyns of his Empire into mine, he can put about my neck the ſtring which is to ſtrangle me. Doth thy Highneſs no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the thoughts which thou hadſt, at ſuch time as, ſeeing me ready to enter into the grave, rather then diſpleaſe thee with craving my liberty of thee, thou reſolvedſt to have the incomparable <hi>Iſabella</hi> be brought away by force. Was it then, my Lord, out of a deſign to raviſh her from me, to perſecute her, to blemiſh thy glory, and to take away my life, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unjuſt thoughts for her? Think not, my Lord, of the ſervices I have done thee, but of thoſe which I purpoſed to do thee; yet think not of them, my Lord, for to pardon me, but think of them to ſave <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Reſtore her to her liberty, make not me the cauſe of her undoing, ſend her back into her Country, and after that put me to death here. But grant me at leaſtwiſe the grace to pronounce my ſentence unto me; for I confeſs to thee once more, that I doubt whether it be poſſible, that thou ſhouldſt be the ſame <hi>Soliman</hi> which hath ſo dearly loved me.</p>
               <p>It is in vain for you to deſire, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that we ſhould be ſeparated; that thought is unjuſt, and does wrong to our affection; it is a motion whereof I repent me, and whereof you ought to repent you. Beg then of <hi>Soliman,</hi> that we may dye, or that we may live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for provided he will grant us this, I will attend his ſentence, without grief, and without unquietneſs. You ſhall live, ſaid <hi>Soliman</hi> then to her, diſcovering his face, which he had all bathed with tears; you ſhall live, generous Princeſs, <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s vertue hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted me.

               <p>During this diſcourſe <hi>Rustan</hi> was in a ſtrange unquietneſs; and when as he believed that <hi>Soliman</hi> had his minde buſied, and did not think of him, he would have ſlipt out of the Chamber, to go and advertiſe <hi>Roxelana</hi> of that which was doing: But <hi>Soliman</hi> perceiving it, Stay, ſaid he unto him, infamous wretch; and then he commanded him to be turned out of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> without permitting him to ſpeak to any body; and charged him with a great deal of fury never to ſhew himſelf more before him. After this, he ſent for the vertuous <hi>Achmat,</hi> and the <hi>Sultana Aſteria.</hi> It is by theſe two perſons, ſaid he to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that I will be counſelled, to know what way we may take, that <hi>Justiniano</hi> may ceaſe to be <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> without making a noiſe amongſt the people, which might prejudice my <hi>State:</hi> For as for my ſelf, continued he ſighing, it is ſo little a while ſince my Reaſon hath recovered its place, as I dare not yet rely upon it. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> whom we will call moſt commonly hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> anſwered the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> with as much generoſity as joy; for wheras he had exceedingly loved this Prince, how great ſoever that was which he felt, to ſee <hi>Iſabella</hi> eſcaped from ſo great a danger, yet was he not a little gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time to make it be beleeved that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was dead, a black Standart was ſet up before the gate of his Palace: <hi>Achmat,</hi> fearing a ſedition, put all the <hi>Janizaries</hi> into arms, and gave them to underſtand, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was a Traytor, that he had gone about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Empire, and that his death had been abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of the <hi>State.</hi> He ſhewed them alſo certain forged Letters, to give the more credit to that which he ſaid; But whatſoever he could ſay, no ſooner was the black Standart ſeen before the gate of his Palace, but all the people began to murmur; There was nothing but weeping and crying all over <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe <hi>Janizaries</hi> that had been the beſt perſwaded, left not for all that to be exceedingly afflicted; for he was ſo univerſally beloved, as there was not any body which did not lament and commend him. Some ſaid, that <hi>Roxelana</hi> without doubt was the cauſe of this miſchief; and that ſhe ſtill remembred, how he had been the Protector of Prince <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> Some cryed out to have at leaſtwiſe the body of their Defender given unto them; others, that his Executioners might be delivered into their hands; and all of them together agreed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that <hi>Soliman</hi> had loſt the force of his Empire, and the ſupport of his <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this tumult, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> paſſing through a ſtreet, the people, who had underſtood by ſome that had been in the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> how it was he which had been made uſe of for this deadly Ceremony, and that he had put <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to death, fell upon him with ſo many impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and with ſuch fury, as they tore him in a thouſand pieces. From thence they went to his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lace, to ſet it on fire; but at length the prudent <hi>Achmat,</hi> having appeaſed this ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned to the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> where he found that Heaven had made an end of revenging <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> on his enemies. For <hi>Roxelana</hi> having underſtood that he was not dead, and that <hi>Ruſtan</hi> had been torn in pieces by the people, this fierce and proud ſpirit, was ſo ſenſibly touched with ſpight for that ſhe could not exerciſe all her whole fury, that after ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three hours together without ſpeaking a word, ſhe dyed for very rage and madneſs; and <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had the ſatisfaction to know, that he was lamented of all the world, and that the only perſons which could rejoyce at his death had been puniſhed for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Achmat</hi> by <hi>Soliman</hi>'s Command cauſed the ſame Chriſtian Veſſel to be made ready, which <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had formerly uſed to get from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and in one night he ſent aboard her all the riches of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Palace, and a great deal more, which he was conſtrained to accept of againſt his inclination. The <hi>Sultan</hi> wrote alſo with his own hand to the illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and again aſſured him of his repentance and affection, whereunto <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> anſwered with a great deal of generoſity. The death of <hi>Roxelana</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Soliman</hi> leſs, then it would have done at any other time. For as he could not but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſhe had been the object of his affection; ſo could he not, but much more remember, that ſhe had been the cauſe of all his misfortunes, and of all his crimes, and that ſhe would have carried him to put to death the only man of the world whom moſt he loved.</p>
               <p>This feigned death of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was carried with ſo much addreſs by the prudent <hi>Achmat,</hi> that every body beleeved it to be ſo; and that is it which hath made <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> and all thoſe which have ſpoken of the raign of <hi>Soliman,</hi> to ſay, that the <hi>grand Viſier</hi> periſhed in that ſort; but indeed the matter paſt as I have delivered it: For a <hi>Greek Caloyer,</hi> who had this Hiſtory from <hi>Juſtiniano</hi>'s and <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s own mouth, left a relation thereof, which is come even unto us.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, three days after the feigned death of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the true <hi>Justiniano, Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Emilia, Leonida, Horatio, Alphonſo, Doria,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Marqueſs, and a number of Chriſtian Slaves, whoſe liberty <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> had obtained, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued themſelves one night, and ſet ſail for <hi>Genoua,</hi> without fear of other enemies, then the winds and the Seas; but Fortune had made too much tryal of their vertue, for to inflict new diſaſters on them; and indeed ſhe was ſo favorable unto them, that never was there a more proſperous Navigation heard of.</p>
